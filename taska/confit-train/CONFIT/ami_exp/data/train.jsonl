, no , it should be", "marketing executive : three four two six seven sev one pe exactly . so we can say one or two . because it is one point eight two , so we will do two .", "marketing executive : again the fashion trends , this also like whether it will be fashionable to have these products in the as a fruit shape .", "user interface designer : going on the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , i would give it , because it is hard to make a fruit good to look at , that looks , so i would actually give it a three . tha three or four , i am not .", "industrial designer : . as far as the technology it its ' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it is missing the screen , as we said , but it does have the push - buttons , or the scroll - buttons , but it does not have that fancy solar power or the vibrating energy mechanism . so i give it a four . i would give it a kinda middle of the road for technology .", "project manager : i am pret just the fruit does me in , it might be trendy to some , but i am just not swallowing the fruit , so also i would have liked to have seen the l_c_d _ screen in it . so i would say about four as .", "marketing executive : personally i wi that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them or showing some association with them . so and in this way our product is good . and the second thing , now people do not want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy . so that is also ef that also our product meets the f the fashion trends of the market . it is cus spongy also . so they can play with it , it is quite good . so then , maybe give it two . so four five ten thirteen . so what about company strategy ?", "user interface designer : the company strategy , . there was lot of discussing , that was good . i feel i got my say . so i would give the company strategy a two .", "industrial designer : it is the remote control conforms to the company strategy . is that the question ?", "user interface designer : is it ?

presentation on this , so i have no , you ca not see a thing . , i am gonna draw it on the board then . it is in blue , and i could not change it . we it is fine on my screen , but never mind . so the idea is that we have got the energy source , which in our case will pr , never mind . so maybe two batteries , what they are called six , like that .", "industrial designer : and then on the remote control itself will have the sender for the signal , which could be an infra - red signal , which will be sent by an electronic chip . and the chip will be controlled by the user interface . so we will hear about that later from gabriel . and the sender will send to the telly itself an infra - red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . and that is it really for the working design

pain , but", "user interface designer : one question i have , and i how much control we have over this is , as far as the infra - red signal , do we have control over , how far away you can be from

right , done , catherine . gab gabriel let is hear from you on such things .", "user interface designer : i am just gonna use the powerpoint . , so , while this is warming up ,", "user interface designer : there it is . so i am doing the user interface design . , and , as far as methods , i was looking at already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , what we can perfect a little bit as far as design . we do not want to do something that is too radical of a change , i , people want a remote that is familiar , that has their favourite functionalities and does the basics , but so we can improve what is out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . so things that seem like absolute must - haves would be a volume control , so up - down keys for that , channel keys up - down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up - down , and a mute button . one thing that i did not include here , that i forgot that we talked about last time , was doing some lock function . , i do not , that is one possibility . and so in the research that i was doing there is two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which i if access the web page from here , but show you . so this is a engineer centred one , so you see it is rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast - forward , all this , freeze frame . and this is a user centred one . it is easier to g just glance at this and see what is possible to do , you are not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .", "user interface designer : and i judging from what we all talked about during our last meeting i gathered that is what we were going after , or the direction we were going in at least . so , the engineering centred ones provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . and this overlaps with what the marketing person , reissa , because we need to find out what people want before we make firm decisions on this . so , that is me .", "project manager : now that is have a q question for you . this w research that you have been doing looki looking at other , existing units . have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or", "user interface designer : no that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as i know . another exists like you said in mobile phones . that was the inspiration for it . i have never seen that with in all my years in the remote business . i have , have not i have never seen a locking functionality . , what do you guys have a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that is really necessary ?", "project manager : i would say it is if it is simple to do , which it probably should be , even if it is a physical , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , then yes ,", "project manager : it is like , like s you said earlier on ab a flip thing , something like that ,", "project manager : but being physical . i have had word down from head office that something that we should be centred , something we should take into account is we have got ta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . it is got ta d look like it is in the r _ and r _ . , the company it is , from what see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them .", "project manager : so it is kinda got ta look it is got ta look new and s something fashionable . if if remote control , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be .", "user interface designer : these , we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what i did not mention yet really is the like the ergonomic design .", "user interface designer : i t we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , .", "user interface designer : everything is going t ergonomic , there is mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p in the market , i .", "project manager : fantastic . right , done , gabriel . let is plug you in , baby .", "user interface designer : this is getting all . , then you just have to do function f _ eight and it should come up .", "marketing executive : come on . , for our marketing report we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants questionnaires to fill out . total number of people tested were a hundred just so , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . so seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . , so they do not like the look of the remote control . eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really and fancy . so we all agree with that . current remote controls do not match with the operating behaviour of the user . so , they do not like the way they operate it does not like match how people behave . per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably do not use those , they only use the up and down channel .", "marketing executive : exactly . that is another thing . seventy five per cent of users say they zap . not quite what they mean , zap , goes like .", "marketing executive : takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . especially for the older generation . i know my grandmother does not like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . anyway and they also remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them . so maybe tracking devices is a good idea . personal preferences .", "marketing executive : so i was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . has to look really , flashy groovy for people to buy it . and it is easy to find , so i whether maybe and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they would be interested in voice activating . so voice activation . so and this was what we came up with . then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age , age groups . so fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes .", "marketing executive : so the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason did not want a voice activated one . and neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .", "marketing executive : the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent say no , so", "project manager : people people from the age of thirty f there is a big drop off there . for people up to the age of thirty five , you are kinda saying , they want it . but no they are not most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,", "project manager : d and tha and that is a that is quite a minority there , so , it is not even like fifty that is th thirty five per cent .", "user interface designer : what about just from the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? if it is twelve fifty per unit . , there is", "marketing executive : repetitive strains injury , so they do not people who watch t_v _ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist .", "project manager : so y so it is so you got so that is something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of", "project manager : see have a look if there is any w any medical background we can find out about this .", "project manager : we just want need to cover our arses so that people are not gonna sue us in ten years ' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury .", "project manager : they are having a lunch break at the moment , but . i will see if get hold of them for the next meeting .", "user interface designer : we can do some really in that department , the ergonomic department , we can make some really good improvements .", "marketing executive : maybe th the buttons not so high up so you do not have to press so much , or we just like flat buttons , something . so that is me .", "project manager : that is great , very much for that , reissa . , so we have decide we have d we have decided that it is gonna be , we are going for a basic television remote . it is got ta be safe to use , it is got ta look . it is got ta be cheap . now going back to the industrial design of it , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra - red or bluetooth . , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , and that would be infra - red , energy source , that would be batteries . mean we can look into using the s , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long - lasting batteries . but a in there is no i do not think there is any point in making a remote control unit that is gonna last for fifty years , because technology will have changed and , we wo not have televisions in ten years ' time . so we are all pretty sussed on that . anyone have any questions ? everybody happy in their work ?", "project manager : now this is good , we have got a good structure

better than that .", "project manager : let is give it a little bit of a snout , i , some teeth .", "project manager : dear . i live right across the street from an open space in california . we have coyotes howl all the time . so i really enjoy their singing , you they are really beautiful animals . moving on to slightly more serious . we are gonna talk about project finances . we have a couple we would like to sell it for about twenty five euro with the profit aim of fifteen million euro from our sales and because this is such this is for television it is a we have a market range of internet , like it is an international market range , we do not have to worry about specifics . in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty euro . so we are selling it for twice what we would like to produce it for . just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project , i could i would like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , your first ideas about creating a new r remote control , what would be the best like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you do not like , etcetera , so", "marketing executive : i hate when there is like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the t_v _ like you have to do one for the power of the t_v _ and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going , i . now they keep combining all different remotes together , and i if i necessarily like that i feel like you end up with multimedia overload . wanna watch the t_v _ . always gets lost . some like device to help you find it .", "user interface designer : i have used , i have used remote controls , for things like t_v _ and the c_d _ player and video recorder and i they are pretty neat little tools . you do not have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel . so especially if you are someone really lazy like me they are pretty . i find them they can be a bit annoying , especially , like if i am watching t_v _ i have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me , one for the t_v _ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as . and also they tend to be a bit confusing , they have got too many buttons on them too complicated when all i really wanna do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume .", "industrial designer : i agree with having too many remotes around . my dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and i how to work half of them . what is important for me , i , is that it is easy to use and that there is not too many buttons , they are not too small , you need to n to you are doing . and one thing i particularly like is if you are not moving it around to get it to work with the infra - red . , there is a way around that , but i know in my residence right now the television you have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on ,", "industrial designer : so i it is just simpler just to just turn around the t_v _ itself , and that is if we are gonna make a remote control , it should actually work for what it is doing .", "marketing executive : what about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that do not require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ?", "project manager : but we could but it is possible we could use like a lithium battery that would last a lot longer than like double a_s .", "project manager : like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of m_p _ three players now and that thing . , it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over to combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . so like you said you do not like having all the buttons on one remote , and yet you do not wanna have five remotes . so how do we work with that ?", "industrial designer : could we get something that just has no does not have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that i am not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything , volume control , on , off , channel changing .", "marketing executive : and maybe that spatially divides it , so it is like if you are looki if you are trying to get the t_v _ on that is , like the top thing on the remote , if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we are gonna make it , but if it is like all the t_v _ was here , then all the v_c_r _ was here , all the whatever else we have programmed into it is all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together ,", "industrial designer : and if you would save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you would not need to use every day .", "project manager : so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things . because that is one thing that remotes tend to have buttons that the t_v_s no longer have as . so like you have to have them somewhere , you are gonna m need those special functions occasionally . but not necessarily on the m the normal remote .", "user interface designer : and if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ?", "marketing executive : it is just t_v _ , if it if we are taking it just new product a new television remote control that is not like does not say . , things might be more advanced than that .", "user interface designer : so we should maybe we should assume that i t it is just a television that we are wanting to control . i suppose it would be to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as i if that works technologically or not .", "industrial designer : yes . i we have to define what we are aiming for . if it is just a television then that it is a bit simpler , there is less buttons that would even need to be on it .", "industrial designer : large . if you have older people or people like me that are not very co - ordinated hand - eye , it is really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it .", "project manager : sounds like we have had a good little discussion for our first ideas . mind if we move on ? ps now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes . i believe we have actually been only working on this one for about twenty , so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you would like , but this is just a breakdown of what we will be doing individually . the industrial design , alima will be doing the working design . the user interface designer , that is for . technical functions , i like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons . user requirements , so you will be hearing about different trends , about different things that people need , i the same discussion that we have been having , we will get from the actual consum s consumers . and you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach . i realised in this past one we did not have much , we just wanted to get a little brain - storming done . so very exited to see all your animals and how what wonderful artists we all are . any questions ?", "user interface designer : what we are gonna be discussing at the next meeting ? do we know that ?", "project manager : i have not gotten an agenda yet , i will put that together . i am as we will each get our own instruction", "project manager : and then because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we will come back together . so i am we will all have more concrete things to contribute next time", "project manager : i will type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you . just including all the things that we talked about .", "project manager : yes , i yes , . i will just attach it to an email . and you are number two ,", "project manager : it was lovely meeting you all . just make you keep checking the company

i am pretty excited . let is start it is approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we are gonna do an opening and then i will talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we d discussed , then we will have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria . we will look at the finances and finally a do a production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last one , i do not have it here , but we talked about energy , we are gonna use a kinetic battery , we want to use a simple chip , because we are not gonna need a shuffle , we are gonna need a scroll , we are choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that is curved and we are using push buttons with a supplement of an on - screen menu . and it sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons , including five pre - set channels . let is do the look and feel design presentation first .", "industrial designer : right , we made three different prototypes and i we will start with this one . we have our colours not are not fixed , but this is the general shape . it is you hold it either like this in your left hand or you switch it over and it is easily adaptable to either hand . you can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone , or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , or even there is a whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger . we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . we have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here . if you push if you are just pushing these normally , they are the menu buttons , if the volume buttons rather . if you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . if we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your t_v _ channel choices shows up , and you have your five presets down here . if people wanna grab hold of that , see how it feels in your hand . that is our number one prototype . do you wanna present the potato ,", "user interface designer : this one is known as the potato , it is a how can i present it ? it is an ergonomic shape , so it fits in your hand nicely . it is designed to be used either in your left hand or in your right hand . i have gone here just for four buttons on this one . the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . so you have got volume up and volume down on the other side here . the red ones are for changing channels , channel up and channel down and that is moves between your favourite channels that you have selected . this middle button here brings up the on - screen menu and when you are working in the on - screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button to select and that is it , that is the potato .", "user interface designer : that would be one of your channels , so like channel zero would be t to switch the machine off ,", "marketing executive : could the middle button of the on - screen menu function as a power button ?", "user interface designer : not really , it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your t_v _ off .", "user interface designer : that would be one way of doing it , . that would work , .", "industrial designer : . on off , that is a possibility , . and then finally we have the martian or the pear , either way . it is a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel . you have the on off toggle stem on the top . we have the five preset seeds . and then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three - dimensional , you have your channel changing , volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle . so , that is for your consideration as , plus it is an interesting talking point to have standing up .", "industrial designer : we figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if i made the bot the bottom flat .", "user interface designer : so that is our three prototypes . in terms of making decisions , what we would need to do is first of all decide on a form which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what button layout we want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or a logo on it or whatever .", "industrial designer : we were we were thinking that normally we would go for fruity colours , but maybe we are also thinking that your middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , so m maybe we would have one version that is a bit toned down , maybe with less contrasts on it . , something still a little bright to make it hard to lose , but", "project manager : now that was one thing that we brought up over email . i if you picked up your email , but the f the feature that we considered for it not getting lost .", "industrial designer : right . we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it is not just like another piece of technology around your house . it is gonna be somewhere that it can be seen . so we are not thinking that it is gonna be as critical to have the loss", "marketing executive : but if it is like under covers or like in a couch you still ca not see it .", "project manager : it is really would it be very difficult to just have an external device that like , you tape to your t_v _ that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off ? do you think that would be conceptually possible ?", "user interface designer : it would be difficult technologically , because if your remote is lost it is probably under the settee and in that case you ca not send an infrared sing signal to it to find it , s so it is i am not quite how it would work", "user interface designer : and then i wonder if it is more just a gimmick then anything else . ho how many times do you really , lose your remote control and would a device like that actually help you to find it ?", "industrial designer : there might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon .", "project manager : that is a fair evaluation . we so we do we have decided not to worry about that for now . , the designs are very bright , so you are right , they are gonna stick out , but", "marketing executive : i feel like this is simil or it is what already exists so if we are trying to think of something like new and fun , even though this is like what you are init i am initially drawn to , just it is like comfortable and like not different . i like this one , like i why , it just it is like small but still like cute looking , but i also like the b the side buttons on that one , like that is neat . but how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , looking thing that we also need to focus on .", "project manager : could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ? so then w we would not have to have like a dual function ?", "project manager : why do not we do a product evaluation using your criteria , if you have developed some ?", "marketing executive : i was a little vague on what exactly i am supposed to do , but let me i have to like write something on the whiteboard , so .", "marketing executive : no , i actually do not have like a powerpointy thing , it would be redundant .", "project manager : there it could have a stem like that , i do l like the stem .", "project manager : it almost helps you ge keep a grip too , it goes in between fingers .", "industrial designer : is that where people are leaning then , the potato ? i like the idea of the", "project manager : i am worried about like using a menu . in that like i withing menus there are submenus , and so how do you get back to the main menu ?", "industrial designer : that on the ipod , you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level .", "project manager : but that has a menu button separate from a select button , whereas if this one is both the menu and the select button ?", "user interface designer : this is , it is the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices . you find the choice that you want and you press the right button .", "user interface designer : . , so they are used for going into and out of your submenus , .", "industrial designer : maybe maybe it can be one of those , if you press down and hold for two seconds , then it brings you back one level .", "project manager : . , as long as we have that in mind as we are designing it still ,", "marketing executive : so which one are we roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s necessities , the yellowy one is that", "marketing executive : we can change it after we go through each different one . so what we need to do is some of the things that we have talked about before we need to make that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to . what we wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then i will tabulate an average just to make that it does meet that . we will just go through them one at a time and we will just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true , or false , if the remote that we have created conforms to the following criteria . we can do this one first . first we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel objective . so like in my opinion the for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so i am gonna say it is like a three . that is just my opinion . what does each of you", "project manager : i think it is unique enough that i would give it a one or a two .", "industrial designer : if it is creative . if fancy is the word i would use . if any of them are fancy in i would say two , because c unique .", "marketing executive : and two , awesome . alright , and same scale for functionality , is it functional ? it is extremely functional , i am gonna give it a one .", "user interface designer : it is functional , it is also pretty basic , so i will give it a two .", "project manager : functional . it will get everything done , it might be a little confusing at first , i if that is gonna be a later one .", "marketing executive : she said it was one . is it technologically innovative ? not really , not so much , we do not have the l_c_d _ screen , we do not have fancy chip . other than what it looks like , if it is really", "marketing executive : and if it is made of like latex , that whole idea , that is pretty .", "marketing executive : i will give it a three . it we could have picked a lot of features that would have made it really", "industrial designer : i would say that it is like fancy versus creative it is different . but does that equal innovative ? i will give it a three .", "user interface designer : i would say it is technologically it is not unique , it is just it is just pushbuttons , so i would give it a four .", "project manager : think i am gonna go with the four as . i really like that kinetic battery though .", "marketing executive : next , is it easy to use ? just so , easy to learn will be separate , so do not overlap them . it is really easy to use . i will give it a two .", "marketing executive : we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality and if it is made of latex or rubber i it is spongy all the way .", "marketing executive : alright and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ? is it gonna be yellow ?", "project manager : if we i know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in and the outside in yellow , that would be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that is more fruity .", "marketing executive : and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? remember earlier we discussed that people do not use a lot of buttons , that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most . we really took that into account a lot , so i am gonna give it a one .", "marketing executive : did you say one , rose ? also we talked earlier about r_s_i _ and wanting to prevent any like carpal tunnely thing . do we think that the latex grip appropriately takes that into account ? i will give it a two , i almost feel like no matter what you do , something is gonna happen .", "project manager : and if it is repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you are constantly pushing ,", "project manager : i like how it fits in the hand though so i would go with a two .", "industrial designer : i will say two as . because older people that are not used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first , but", "marketing executive : and the ease of learning it . i know you were saying that you are a little bit nervous about that , it reminds me of the ipod . got mine , i still have not read the instruction book and i am doing , so and i am not good at learning technology . so i will give it a two .", "industrial designer : the menu system and the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but if it is one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you will have it afterwards . so i would give it a two i .", "user interface designer : it is probably a little harder then most remotes to learn , because you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are", "user interface designer : and that could take a bit of learning at first , but once you have , once you would learned how to use it , it is a lot easier . so i would give it a four .", "project manager : i would give it a four too . it is a pretty high learning curve , it will be easy once you have done it ,", "marketing executive : also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we are not addressing that , so", "marketing executive : in terms of not losing it , do you think that on a scale of one to seven , how easy or hard is it to lose ? i am gonna give it a four , that you can still if it is in between somewhere where you ca not see it , you are not gonna find it , but anywhere else it is gonna stand out .", "industrial designer : i would say i would give it a three , i it depends on how tidy you are normally .", "user interface designer : i will give it a five i it would be easy to lose something like that , .", "marketing executive : overall , we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion , so those are the next two things we are gonna look at . separate from fancy , like that thing . it like wants to be simple but it is not like simple , so i am gonna give it a two .", "marketing executive : how fashionable can you make a remote ? it is bringing technology and fashion together real really .", "marketing executive : and does it meet our like demographic need for international appeal , that whole thing ? just that it would se serve our audience . i do not see why not .", "project manager : as long if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements . , that is good . so i will give it a two .", "marketing executive : did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we did not talk about ?", "project manager : we did not address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo , so let is make we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an r_r _ on it .", "marketing executive : and so we are gonna do that , so it will address it , fine .", "project manager : now we are gonna look at finances . i have an excel sheet that we are actually gonna calculate the cost , so let me exit out of this first .", "project manager : i know . let me one more space . gonna zoom in real quick . we are using kinetic battery ,", "industrial designer : i never did get a picture of those so i do not really know . our case material supplements we just skipped by them .", "industrial designer : are we talking about on each colour combination or are we , we will like we will have yellow and black . is that two special colours ?", "project manager : interface , we are doing push buttons . and how many buttons do we have ?", "industrial designer : no . we will do we wa are the buttons in special colour , special f i did not get information on", "project manager : buttons , so . so the case material will just have one colour , right , but then the buttons will be in special colours ?", "industrial designer : does it but if we are making multiple varieties of this is where i am getting confused .", "project manager : but the case is could have up to thr the buttons could ea could be up to three colours , that how it is designed there .", "industrial designer : no , i do not . they are if they are all gonna be rubber then it that is what it matters .", "marketing executive : it would not make sense otherwise , for the whole mat case material it is only one . it is it is two to make it rubber .", "project manager : let is see what that would do . it is only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway . are we this is double - curved ? maybe it is single - curved ,", "project manager : it is not the it is the kinetic battery that is expensive , but we have a simple chip , single curve , case material is rubber and it is a special colour , but that is important . six buttons we have to have six buttons .", "industrial designer : that is important . how did it get more expensive , what did you just change ?", "project manager : we are all set . i saved that to our big shared folder , back to agenda . are the costs under twelve fifty euro ?", "project manager : let is move on to the project evaluation . project process . satisfaction with the room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , the means , any new ideas found . so i what we are gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project , the information we got on the news , how we used it , if we were able to , use our creativity with the information , how i led it , the how we worked together as a team , the digital pens , the whiteboard .", "user interface designer : in that we have achieved almost all of the design goals that we have set and we have come up with a finished project and we just about got cost .", "industrial designer : we could have done even better with a little bit more information , like what is a single - curved case , how many colours , what do colours count things , but given what we had that we did really . we worked together pretty .", "marketing executive : if i would had more market research on the fruits and vegetables , maybe we could have taken that into account .", "marketing executive : the pen was a little distracting for me personally , like its heaviness , and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages , . that was a bit of a distraction . that was the last one , like i chose not to do a powerpoint i did not think it made sense to , so i liked that i had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole thing .", "project manager : we all made very significant contributions , i do not think anybody dominated it , which was really good , like each of us was able to like each of you had your information and i tried to facilitate it without like taking over , i like our little finished products .", "industrial designer : should we have that somewhere on the packaging ? i have a little r_r _ .", "industrial designer : hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but it is quite a useful little gadget . all to iain for the design of that one . what did we find for new ideas ?", "project manager : definitely . or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches etcetera .", "industrial designer : i knew you can get watches that had them , like really quite expensive watches that just never need a battery , you are always moving your wrist . but in other things , it would be really good .", "project manager : i thi , that is awesome . are the costs within the budget ? is the project evaluated ? there is the final questionnaire and meeting summary . so , this is the great product kids , we have created something really interesting and that we have a market for it , especially if we can produce it at twelve point three which we hope make in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the final results and .", "project manager : i do like the martian remote . if we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice .", "industrial designer : is it started as a pear , but then it started looking more and more like a martian when i put the", "project manager : anybody have i got more master classes , anybody else wanna like take a master is class ?", "project manager : but check it out . so like there are all these like links , they do not go anywhere . but all that you need to keep in mind your knowledge management . just wanna make you do .", "marketing executive : no the first one that you sent like i did not realise that it was a joke and i was like why did she send this to us ? it is very it is very work relevant ,", "project manager : i am very sad that i did not get any links to the corporate website .", "industrial designer : what did i get through the corporate website ? it is just inspiration about circuit boards .", "marketing executive : you can just see what is up . it is really deep . takes a little while to get excited to load . that the excel thing is pretty .", "marketing executive : it is like inspiration , i am gonna give you two sentences on fashion and that thing , see . you did not miss out that much .", "industrial designer : my inspiration from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit , talking about circuit boards .", "industrial designer : i learned a lot actually . i could probably take apart a remote control now if i really needed to .", "industrial designer : now i have all about circuits and chips and transponders and i wrote it all down , because it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control , but then they are like , you do not actually need this you just need to talk about the case .", "marketing executive : that is like mine it was like , would you prefer an l_c_d _ screen or a multifunction remote control ? and then it did not have like any table , awesome , i am glad they asked that question and did not report the result .", "project manager : no . although i do not see how we could have very l at least for me", "industrial designer : i if i would gotten pictures of the different parts of the case , the different looks of the case , i would have probably drawn them up ,", "marketing executive : we were not like voting on anything and usually , like whiteboards are good , like crossing out ideas , or like if we had like a brainstorming period .", "industrial designer : we could have put our brainstorming up there rather than just talking about it , but with only four people it does not really make sense .", "project manager : and with and with the powerpoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things on powerpoint", "marketing executive : and these might have made us more willing to like take notes than to like write up them here , we all needed them separately , on the whiteboards in this room .", "industrial designer : because we are all gonna be working in different places . we if we were all gonna stay in here all the time , then having the notes up on the whiteboard would have been alright , but everyone needs their own , like specific notes , i .", "project manager : when you were creating your prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ?", "user interface designer : we worked together , but we were making like we made different shapes and then discussed how the buttons might work , and

we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the first on the component concept , so what energy we use what chip on print and one ki case . and also on user interface concept what interface we use and if there is some supplements . and at the end sammy will give a trend watching on what he is been doing . it is so , let is go . first with rama . participant two .", "industrial designer : so we are to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we will use for energy , and the material and interface . for energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . first one , we can use simple battery , or we can use traditional solar cells or and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this r_s_a _ and then titanium , which can be which have very good look an and then interface we are to use push buttons or liquid crystal d l_c_d _ display . and we can use some , moving thing . so , as we discussed before , we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . this can be simple programmable chip and which can use microphone sensors . and we also want to look at our remote control , so . still we are looking for possible technical specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we are to in our twelve euros or around that . so we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .", "industrial designer : we discussed an excuse me . we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic to have enough energy with the solar cells and so we would like to just use simple battery . and also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or the problem is with this design we found that we ca not use double - curved shapes .", "industrial designer : it is in manufacturing i it is problematic . we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it is really lesser re really less expensive compared to l_c_d _ which are which needs advanced chip technology and it is more expensive ,", "industrial designer : since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce cost .", "project manager : i want to know why it b just but for the point before why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .",

titanium but there are some rubber or some rubber parts like", "industrial designer : these you can with the rubber in four directions and but full assembly we will use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also it is bit difficult to do all the shapes . and this push buttons", "industrial designer : we would like to use push buttons instead of l_c_d_s and so we want to mo we are we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money", "user interface designer : it is not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus .", "industrial designer : maybe we can see depending on how we will come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and", "industrial designer : because the speech recognition technology will take at least five euros so we want to reduce the cost on display", "user interface designer : it is not gonna be a touch pad , just a display for giving you information .", "industrial designer : that can we can consider , because like it wo not take much money i , because , . you have any further questions or ?", "industrial designer : we are to go for li and now we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries", "marketing executive : so this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just the finding it , instead of clapping why not just be ask .", "industrial designer : that is then the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it will be it m maybe at least five , six people want to use it so how to define our re speech recognition whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . if we are going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology", "industrial designer : if everybody in the house n to locate then we are to go for some speaker independent technology .", "marketing executive : but it is always like that . we have dreams and the in the end we find out that it is not feasible .", "user interface designer : have a look at this no it is so the concept of the interface . generally i developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user is manual and all the complex things that come together with your t_v _ and remote controls . so let is start with this . we got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and the l_c_d _ is going to be somewhere here and go back button , i really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and power on and off i do not remember it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? so that is our concept . it is called the millennium remote control .", "user interface designer : we will not use this . we will not use this . but instead of this i will devise that is our concept .", "user interface designer : and it is got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this we already discussed .", "user interface designer : and what will people say ? they will say it is perfect . or what will say ? they will say it is splendid . and e everyone will say i will buy it .", "user interface designer : that is why you do not have it . that is why , it is nasty .", "industrial designer : instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this the shapes and they can have different assembly .", "project manager : you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on l_c_d _ ,", "user interface designer : what there is one more decisi one more solution , there are some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature ,", "marketing executive : because there are two kinds of people . those for which the remote control is to be something useful i am going to talk about this later and those for which is something that is specific to them so it is like a signature . my remote control is pink . nobody else than me has a pink remote control . and that makes me special .", "project manager : and you think that we do not have to make them pay more because of o or this is", "marketing executive : they would be ready p ready to pay more for that . those who wanted to have it pink .", "marketing executive : the the young people want to be different from their friends . although similar but have something just slightly better . pink", "project manager : so m so maybe that is if that it is a selling point maybe it has to be the base .", "user interface designer : but if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time .", "marketing executive : wh take the ipod . it is a remote control . it is white and it is so white that you see it from any anywhere . it has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because it is a colour that we do not usually see in a remote control .", "industrial designer : maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips so that like at least", "user interface designer : and the remote control is going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ? and that is a question to you and to", "marketing executive : i heard that it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done so that is the smartness of the thing . currently we do not have guns with speech recognition or beer cans with speech recognition but we may have remote controls with speech recognition .", "marketing executive : do not touch the remote . are are you saying here that the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? the young guy would not be able to use it because his father does not want .", "user interface designer : voice recognition is quite tough . i say do not use it , and the control just looks . i ordered jus to l to l lock it .", "industrial designer : that could be feasible i , like since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition so we can use", "marketing executive : but th i am thinking about the other particularity that the remote control could have . s since it knows who is using it , it might also record the channels you are u more often using and levels of volumes that you are more often things like that and provide you ways of using them , somehow , that might be expensive", "marketing executive : that might also be a good sales pitch again . the remote that knows you .", "marketing executive : four , . trend , no yes . , so i am going to talk about trends and i hope this can help us to understand l how we should design our remote control . first maybe just a small recap on how do we watch trends it is not so simple you might think that it is easy but it is not so simple . anyway these days the best source of information is the web as , so have to go often on the web and look at what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which is a small device that people have with them , always , like a phone . we can we can use the phone as a good example of where to in be inspired . those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because they are not only watching the trends , they are inventing it , they are creating the trend . i hope i am going to try to help you on that . this is more risky because you are not following the trend , you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you do not and you are out of business . so anyway to be quick there is a lot of words here but there are in the market of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to . the first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . and interestingly this is the very most important thing . it has to be fancy . strangely enough it is more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that is the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , it has to be new with some of new technology inside and this is also more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . so as you see it first have to be very , s something that people are proud of that i they can be i d identified with and then something that contains very novel that they can talk about with their friends , mine has this and not yours . and finally it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it is not so important that it is useful as a remote control . and now in a more general broad way of seeing th the thing . if we look back and not look at only remote controls it is important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas currently the trends that we see in l big cities like paris and milan , it seems that this year things should have a fruit and vegetable way of look or feel or so . and i it applies to everything . that is the thing with trends . it it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea . fruit and vegetable . think fruit and vegetable . and if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy ,", "marketing executive : the rubber aspect might be important because it is what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess .", "marketing executive : as a even in the shape it has to be more round and more look natural somehow .", "marketing executive : that is what people seem to i i know it is quite far from what you thought but that is fashion and that is all i have to say .", "marketing executive : as our company is quite big and so i am just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask their friends", "marketing executive : no , it is not this is very general , . but it seems that trends travel across things . the what we", "industrial designer : but some materials n they are to be something like solid like they ca not be really spongy", "marketing executive : but we still have to put our chips inside , so . this is your problem . this is not mine .", "industrial designer : looking fruit . these things can be easily incorporated . we can have t colours or this shape", "marketing executive : if if it is something like rubber made or it is also going to be good .", "project manager : no more question ? we will have next meeting in thirty minutes again . now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for rama wil design ,", "project manager : mark the user interface design , and sammy the product evaluation . you will work together on a new on a prototype using modelling clay .", "project manager :  and i as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction .", "industrial designer : so we want the speech recogniser and we want some buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables ,", "marketing executive : again , as i said we can also try to make it , to create the trend .", "industrial designer : what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? or they really like they more want these fancy features", "marketing executive : i it is again in this what i said first it has to be fancy so if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that and if we can provide it it is a good sell for us", "marketing executive : because we have it and others do not . whether it is useful or not does not seem to be very important .", "project manager : i agree with this now we have to decide on what fanciness . do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy fruity - like", "user interface designer :  ,  . could we make a titanium shape ? fruit - shaped .", "industrial designer : that is a we are to look for and s we are to see the whether rubber is expensive", "project manager : you explore now that you are going to work together these two . or or spongy an", "industrial designer : maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one titanium . we have only the plastic or the chippy fibre chips or", "project manager : i do not think w we have to choose . if we choose titanium or if we choose spongy but it can not be both .", "user interface designer : we will see . i really do not like this modelling clay it makes some for", "marketing executive : you can paint it afterward . we have a very large department of paint .", "project manager : it is what we say , that we have an l_c_d _ with information . not", "marketing executive : that if we want to have as he says if we want to have a small number of buttons we need to have a output that says currently what their actions are .", "marketing executive : that is the converse to having zillions of button where each button does only one thing .", "marketing executive : classical , we stay classical in that we do not reinvent the wheel . anyway it is very in general people

look at the project plan . there will be time for discussion . actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product . and then we will close this session . but first of all we i would like to introduce you to this room . as you probably have noticed there are little black fields on the table . you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face . there are cameras everywhere around the room especially here for your face , and this is not a pie , it is a set of microphones and there are microphones here also . but do not be afraid of them .

following methods . it consists of three phases , namely the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . as you can see , all of these phases consists of two parts , namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss our work so far . but first i will tell you something about the tools we have here . i already talked about the cameras and microphones , but they are not of much use to us . we will have to take advantage of these two things . they are smart boards . as you can see , you can give a presentation on them . and this one here is a white board . i will instruct you about that soon . as you also noticed this presentation document is in our project folder and every document you put in this folder is it is possible to show that here in our meeting room . and there are available on both smart boards but we will mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder . as you can see , this is the same tool bar as is located here . the most functions we will use will be to add a new page , to go back and forward between pages , and to save it every now and then . and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , like this if everything is , but i first have to put it on the pen , you see i am new to it too . and then you can write things like test or whatever you want . as you can see you have to move it a little bit slow , it is not such a fast board , it is a smart board but also a slow board . but you can write things and you can also , when you click here , erase things , so we have est left . and you can also delete an entire page , but we ask you not to do that . just simply create a new one and start all over because we want to save all the results . does everyone understand this", "project manager : you

going to ask you to draw your favourite animal . it is also to gets to know each other because i am asking three things , for that drawing , to do it on a blank sheet , with different colours and

what we can find here . a very warm welcome again to everyone . here we are already at our functional design meeting . and this is what we are going to do . the opening , which we are doing now , and the special note , i am project manager but on the meetings i am also the secretary , which means i will make minutes as i did of the previous meeting . and i also put these as fast as possible in the project folder , so you can see them and review what we have discussed . if i am right , there are three presentations , i each one of you has prepared one ?", "project manager : and we will also take a look at new project requirements , if you have not heard about them yet . and then we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time , forty minutes . but we will need it . i who wants to go first with his presentation .", "industrial designer : i wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . it is possibly very handy if you want to design one of those . so it works as i r wrote down in this little summary . when you press a button , that is when you do pr when you want to turn up the volume , a little connection is made the rubber button just presses on a little print plate which makes a connection that gives the chips , which is mounted beneath those that plastic of a rubber button . senses that a connection has been made , and know and knows what button you pressed , becau the volume up or volume down button . the chip makes a morse code like signal which then is si signalled to several transistors which makes which sends the signal to a little let . what a let is ? and that makes the infra - red lights signal which is sent to the television set . which has a sensor in it to sense the signal of the infra - red . that is how it works . the findings that i found searching up some detailed information about the remote controls , are that they are very easy to produce , it is pis it is possible to make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as printing a page , just fibreglass plate is b is covered with some coatings and chips . and the technology is already available , we do not have to find out how remote controls have to work or how that how to make some chips that are possible to transmit those signals . i made a little animation of about how a tran our remote controller works .", "industrial designer : the sub - component , i suppose that you understand what a sub - component is , is f in this example it is the button . when it is pressed down , the switch is ter is switched on , so with the wire is sent to the chip in co - operation with the battery , because to make a signal possible you have to have some li a d ad electronic", "industrial designer : yes , . w after it is being composed by the chip the signal is transported to the infra - red bulb , and from there it signals a morse code - like signal to the b to the bulb in the television set . s i wrote down some personal preferences about the remote control . it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , so you do not have to wind it up , or just is it is very light to make to use it . i personally pref prefer that it would be p come available in the various colours , and easy to use buttons . but i suppose that the one of the other team members thought of that too .", "industrial designer : and it is possible for several designs and easy to use b , easy to use buttons . perhaps soft touch , touch screen buttons because the rubber buttons are always they slightly they can be slightly damaged , so the numbers on the buttons are not possible to read anymore . and as i said before th we can make several designs . , that is my contribution to this meeting , and", "user interface designer : my name is , and i looked at technical functions design of the remote . i did this by looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they look , and information from the web that i found . what i found was that th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you d what you described just early . and this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , change the channel , adjust volume , that thing . play video , teletext , but also t play c_d _ if you use it your c_d _ player the remote control will that one . there are some examples of remote controls . you can see they are very different . the one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of buttons etcetera . and the other is more user friendly , little with big buttons . and not n all the you can do with it , but the essential is there . i you could better y you should look at a user centred approach , because the customers have to use them and if they do not think it is usable they wo not buy it . a lot of buttons they may think from i do not need s as much as that . perf personal preferences is a simple remote , with the basic functions that you can need that you could use . but keep in mind the new functions of t_v _ what we discussed earlier , split screen and is that a function that you should have ? because all the t_v_s will have them . or because of only a few and is not really necessary . and then make it i would make so that you can could use it on more than one appliance . if you have one that does with the vi the video , it could also work with the stereo , because play is play and stop and that thing . the shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you do not have to have a lot of buttons for anything . and it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much . and that is my presentation .", "marketing executive : kijke , so . we are going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just , and the users , actually . the methods i prefer is we are going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? and then tho that section we are going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five years are more interested in fj features like l_c_d _ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . and we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . the elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that is two fifth , of the market share in that area . fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . so we do not have to make it very small , like a mobile phone , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you do not lose it that much anymore . seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or should not be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . important issues about the remote . it would be better with a personal reference , but . remote control has to have a low power usage , because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . the volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those they those have to h be find very easily . and have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera . it has also be have to find easily when the label is gone . my colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off or would be s senden . so if that is k if that is the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote . like what all colleagues said , have to be minimalized . or should be covered , or in l_c_d _ screen . l_c_d _ screen is easy because we have the l_c_d _ screen , we have the various options . put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . and you do not see the buttons . so l_c_d _ screens should be easy , but an l_c_d _ screen , the problem with the l _ sc l_c_d _ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years do not use the l_c_d _ screen a lot . so we have to that keep that in mind that if you are going to implement l_c_d _ screen , you do not have to make it that hard to learn or to use .", "marketing executive : touch screen , . the last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . and the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . so we have to keep in mind to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . and on my personal preferences , i do not have any mo more time to come with that , but like i said , l_c_d _ screen is easily to use because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons . and it should be easy to use . especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels . and that is it .", "project manager : so you can all read them . , not in this presentation . should be in there . tell you them from my laptop . teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet .", "project manager : so that is the first thing we should pay less attention to teletext . the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market , and would make it more costly , . our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before . and a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . so we have to keep that in mind . according to our agenda it is then time to take a decision on the remote control functions . so , who has any idea about what should be on it , and what should not ?", "marketing executive : the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it ,", "user interface designer : yes s sh a button where you can change from one number to two numbers .", "marketing executive : it is easy to implement a button with a s what which especially do that , because some t_v_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve ,", "industrial designer : and and there are some models that do not accommodate that function . so d wh the philip is television makes it possible in that to press one and then two to make the tj to reach channel twelve .", "industrial designer : but all the television makes use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to get", "project manager : new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , and now we have current customers of forty plus .", "marketing executive : forties , because younger people as younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in l_c_d _ screen . from twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent , and thirty six to forty five , fifty five percent , so to because on most recog remote controls the print plate will be broken how much , two years . you have to press h very hard to go to the next channel .", "marketing executive : with the l_c_d _ screen it is easier because you only have to wipe the screen to for fingerprint ,", "industrial designer : true , true . but is it possible to make an l_c_d _ screen , how was the information ?", "marketing executive : it only says that this perce percentage like l_c_d _ screen . because , and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical .", "marketing executive : you how much it costs . you how much it costs , the l_c_d _ screen .", "user interface designer : but if you would do an l_c_d _ screen do we have do not you have any buttons ? or because if it only directs at the t_v _ , then you only have i what you want to do with the l_c_d _ screen .", "industrial designer : no , an l_c_d _ screen is just like a drawn here . just displays several buttons ,", "industrial designer : if you wanted the minimal use b buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h displays four buttons on the screen", "industrial designer : and it is possible to p press them down , just like a touch screen .", "user interface designer : alright . so you can adjust which buttons you want on that s screen .", "marketing executive : if you want to adjust , like , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings ,", "industrial designer : i suppose wi if the mar if our if the i if the young people are interested in l_c_d _ screens , we should make 'em .", "industrial designer : and if that is our d market share to and our goal to deliver those remote controls", "user interface designer : but he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , but also on the older , and will they use it if it only has an l_c_d _ screen ?", "marketing executive : but s forty six to forty five , thirty three percent , and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent .", "marketing executive : but our what is it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty .", "marketing executive : but market share fro for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger .", "marketing executive : i if it costs gets too much , too expensive , then , we should be sticking to rubber buttons .", "industrial designer : can you s that they will send you some information about the cost of l_c_d _ screens .", "industrial designer : so if you receive an email about that , can you post it in the or should not we post that in our projects mail folder .", "user interface designer : perhaps we should have a backup plan that we would use buttons if it is too expensive .", "marketing executive : l_c_d _ , . then you have the seventy five percent of users find it r ugly .", "marketing executive : and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy .", "user interface designer : but they do not like it . they think it is ugly . when it has an l_c_d _ screen .", "project manager : and maybe you can make something fancy out of an l_c_d _ remote , because it is new , as far as i know .", "marketing executive : and then you have the other thing , that seventy five percent zap a lot , but that is not a f question with the l_c_d _ screen . only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it .", "marketing executive : the most important things on a f on an remote control are channel selection , volume con selection , and power s power usage . and a teletext , but that is not of the question .", "user interface designer : but should not you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it ?", "project manager :  . , and we could make an a separate menu on the l_c_d _ screen for teletext .", "marketing executive : and other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings ,", "industrial designer : it is also important to make it possible to how do you call it in english , to not use batteries , and use ac bat batteries to be", "industrial designer : because i when you get an l_c_d _ screen , you run it on batteries , the batteries will be empty very soon , very fast .", "user interface designer : you should perhaps you should be able to switch the control off . if you have an l_c_d _ screen that is burns all the time .", "user interface designer : you should not on and off because that is ver extra , that you have t first you have to turn the remote on , and then you can i .", "marketing executive : it is not that easy because i do not think people will like it who that you have to turn it on first and then use it ,", "marketing executive : so it is better when th the t_v _ shuts down , the remote shuts down .", "marketing executive : and then b that before an hour when its get again gets empty . then you have plenty of time to recharge it , of put it in a recharger .", "marketing executive : because when you are watching t_v _ , you are zapping and you have to put it in a recharger ,", "industrial designer : when you when you are done with s w watching your television , you have to put it", "marketing executive : but then we have to be that the batteries go hours , six hours , five , six hours , then .", "user interface designer : but you will also forget to put it in , because you throw it on the couch", "industrial designer : but you also forget to buy batteries , and then you ca not use it , so i", "marketing executive : or we have to be that the batteries last couple of days when they are recharged .", "industrial designer : high power user cell , i it should be a standard move to put your remote control in the charger when you are done watching television ,", "industrial designer : that is also a great advantage because you ca not lose it anymore . because you are obliged to put it in the charger and not to leave it in a couch between some cushions .", "user interface designer : but then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch", "user interface designer : because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the t_v _ .", "industrial designer : just a cable , or a even a charger where you can mount it on . something like that , just u", "marketing executive : it has to be easy to use also , or things . market share , speaker re speech recognition .", "industrial designer : functional designs for the elderly you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , so make it possible to not display a button at ten points", "industrial designer : but it is one of the functions you have to specify . because we can look at perhaps forty buttons at a screen , but the elderly only look at two buttons .", "marketing executive : twelve . that is an also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent .", "industrial designer : let is leave out all the remote controls and just put a microphone on top of the television to", "marketing executive : is this only would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . it is the only thing it says .", "project manager : maybe because of the cost , but nobody knows how much it will cost .", "marketing executive : no it is better to have l _ l_c_d _ screen , because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five , we have about thirty percent of the market share in our hands , and fifty five of those people want l_c_d _ screen and thirty five want speech recognition . so it is better to keep it with l_c_d _ screen .", "marketing executive : if it should be done , if it could be done , i wo not matter .", "user interface designer : but how would you like to implement that , that you say volume up , and then it goes up ,", "user interface designer : then you also have to have different languages if we go international . then it is y it is yours to do a french and dutch and english", "marketing executive : . but that should also be with f should be also with l_c_d _ screen .", "industrial designer : y it should be done . if it could be done , should be done .", "industrial designer : because i already use on several voice operated systems , and they are all possible to not all , but", "user interface designer : you could use that n as an option , if you have money left , .", "project manager : so we only do this when we have enough money left . i have written down an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , the digits from one to zero , . or from zero to nine . a digits button to switch between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator . we are going to use a docking station and probably l_c_d _ and if there is enough money , speech recognition . and the possibility to enlarge buttons or to have large buttons", "user interface designer : i with teletext if it was not ver very important , it was but you also now have colours . i if we should implement that .", "user interface designer : when you press the red button , you go to page one hundred two , and when you press the i if we should implement that , because it says that teletext not really important ,", "marketing executive : we should we could that we could also implement a audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub - menus . d mainly if you turn the remote control on , you have to u you have to see from one till zero , channel and volume . and if you want to use teletext screen or audio , then you can press it .", "industrial designer : . i will search . if you want to use teletext , you can push the teletext button and then the options become available .", "user interface designer : have got two examples here , but i do not think there is anything we are missing .", "marketing executive : yes , so this is your presentation . we could check the other remote controls with technical functions .", "marketing executive : i go to have volume , mute but i . the zoom buttons .", "user interface designer : so the first you see the main , and the other ones you can go to", "industrial designer : if you do not got a wide screen television you do not need the screen settings", "marketing executive : you do not yu a no you then you do not no ni do not then you do not use it .", "marketing executive : so you leave it alone . or it could be possible to have a standard version of the remote , an expanded version .", "user interface designer : and do we want them in different colours , or and the buttons , should they have colours ?", "industrial designer : colours the main colour of the remote control is the colour of the l_c_d _ screen .", "industrial designer : twelve euro fifty . make it available in different colours , you mean ? red , white , blue , black .", "project manager : so i have the things read . then we have separate menus for teletext , screen settings , audio settings , and what else ?", "user interface designer : so you can program the t_v _ . perhaps you should you would throw them on in one pile . so , options , and then you sub them .", "marketing executive : or otherwise you have a menu button , press menu then you have main menu search all the settings .", "project manager : we are having a general menu with the most used functions , teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings , and maybe there are options for the remote itself ? like large icons or small icons i what else , but", "user interface designer : no , no . you should be able to set which t_v _ you have . if you have if you have", "industrial designer : you need a settings button , or a settings option for the remote control .", "user interface designer : but is not idea to use what you said , normal on and off button for the t_v _ , that you do not have to use a", "marketing executive : no no , because we discussed that you could charge it , otherwise is it jumps to stand - by mode automatically .", "marketing executive : but a t_v _ , th that is the that is a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel .", "project manager : maybe there should be a separate button apart from the l_c_d _ , because you ca not turn it on when the l_c_d _ is off . so how do you turn the thing on ? there has to be a on button on the remote ,", "marketing executive : just the remote . a television do not have to be on , that one you can press on ,", "marketing executive : stand - by , then press on remote , press on and then t_v _ should be available .", "user interface designer : a . i whether it is handy to have a n a normal on button , a r just rubber for t_v _ ,", "user interface designer : so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel . otherwise you i whether or not that is", "industrial designer : because when you touch the l_c_d _ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on .", "user interface designer : i if you use the l_c_d _ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , then you then turn it , and then the t_v _ goes on . but if you have a normal on button on the remote , then you do the on , and then you search the channel which you want .", "marketing executive : but the re the remote control , if you press tap the screen , it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button , channel button , and of also the on and off button .", "industrial designer : it looks a lot more fancy if you use if you do not have any buttons on the s on remote control .", "project manager : so actually we are going to create a button - less remote . that is might be a unique selling point , for a remote .", "project manager : postpone further discussion to our next meeting , because we are running out of time . for now , we are having a lunch break , and then there will be half an hour for the next share of individual work . i will write minutes , if create them out of this . and put them in the project documents folder . and here are the individual

everyone to our next meeting . i am busy writing and busy leading the meeting , but i have prepared a little presentation once again or at least an agenda the biggest part of the presentation will be on your side . we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened . once again i will try to write some minutes which from the previous meeting placed inside our project folder , which was quite some typing . today we once again have three presentations , if i am right , and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts . and just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that . i would say let is start with the first presentation . in the same order as last time ?", "industrial designer : welcome you all . components design , first of all i would like to accommodate some of those things i elaborate some of the things i did . i elaborated on the concept . what should be said about the components , its properties and what materials should we use to make one of those r remote controls . first of all i have d subtracted some of the components that is that are used are w from what the remote control is formed . first of all , the case , the surrounding of the remote control . i would like to give you an idea of how about .", "industrial designer : giraffe is gone now . the case was is made from rubber , i suppose . there is one of the because when you use a remote control a lot of people will drop their remote control", "industrial designer : and they break becau the titanium was also an option . but it is a very expensive material . rubber is , the best suitable material to use for our remote control . it is poss it is also possible to create fancy colours with rubber . rubber l makes it easy to it lets itself colour . titanium you have to paint it and with that it is possible to scratch it or make it ugly . rubber the total piece of rubber that is sor that is used to make the case is the same colour , so if you scratch it is still the same colour , perhaps it is a little bit damaged . but it is a very strong material . i h i had an idea single covered curved , single curved . so it is t two dimensional . it is best to draw", "industrial designer : let is make it black . of an idea like this . so it also looks when it is on your table . so you get it does not lay flat down on the table , but it is c it is stands .", "industrial designer : side view yes it is side view i am not technically good at th three d _ modelling , but . it is just an idea i had so it is very so its also looks when it is on the table . the graphical user interface and the buttons , we also thought about that already . about the l_c_d _ touch screen , which is easy to clean too . one of the great advantages of the l_c_d _ screen you just use some or another cleaning cl some cleaning . and it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright . i already s explained some properties of that material and we also we almost concluded about that this should be our button component .", "industrial designer : so that is all about the buttons . the batteries , we also thought about that already , will be chargeable with an option for a mount station so you can put the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of plugging it in like that .", "industrial designer : and they should be long lasting , not be empty in about two minutes or thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . and next step is the chip th the component that is makes or transmits the signal to the television . there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but because of our highly requiring requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it with also the ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition which unfortunately is still in a test phase , there should be some more investigation on that side . my personal preferences i also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use our own business colours . that was correct , was not it ?", "project manager : business colours it was the slogan and the corporate image , so , it needs colour ,", "project manager : but i do not think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour .", "industrial designer : was not it ? so it d it does not says to have the slogan ?", "industrial designer : we could make a little r _ and r _ on the top of the machine . they are pretty boring , i suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours and also in a lot of possible colours , so it is possible to make very fancy remote controls which peopl who people in which people will find they are interesting . and will buy them faster when they look at the same old grey or black colours . s as i said before rubber is impossible to damage severely imp instead of you can break it when you break it in s with a pair of scissors like that , but i if you drop it is not broken right away s instead of using plastic , hard plastic or titanium . and i personally liked the single curved remote control , because it makes sense . that is all about my findings .", "user interface designer : alright so a little bit about the interface . how it should look . and we determined that will not be no buttons , but only an l_c_d _ screen , so i had to look on that . and the design is therefore based on what we just thought of . first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . and this is that you ask you give a question through the device and it answers you . and they already put this in an in a coffee maker . and so that it you say good morning , coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning joe or what is your name . this and there is an easy way to program that you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer . perhaps it is useful , perhaps for because people lose the remote , they can yell remote where are you and calls .", "user interface designer : and perhaps we could implement that . and then i have to go out of the presentation because i tried to make some a idea of how it should look like", "user interface designer : but i ca not draw , so do not make too much of it . i tried to the l_c_d _ screen i tried to draw . at least the icon for the volume . i if there is an icon for the program , but", "user interface designer : and then the buttons above and below the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon .", "user interface designer : i forgot that one . i forgot something , but . and and the numbers , that should be a bit larger it is not really on scale and .", "user interface designer : an options button . and the button for teletext apar apart because it is not really options , . it is options is the settings of the remote and of the t_v _ and that thing .", "user interface designer : so could call it settings . but this is a bit how it . and the l_c_d _ somewhere on the remote . perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , so that it is better in your hand .", "user interface designer : but and a microph microphone for the speech recognition if we want to implement that . and then if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what you could do and that you could do with something like this .", "user interface designer : and it is also think we discussed earlier that older people do not really want to use these extra settings . and older people a also do not really want to use this th this option menus . so they want to u use one button and then something happens , and not choose with this and you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your remote , so you could scroll across these things . that is an option . and that was my finding dinge .", "marketing executive : i am going to tell you something about a trend watching . the trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and . the method i used was like i told i watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted from elderly and young people . so we can keep that in mind for designing f the device itself . findings i made . the most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look fancy . the second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , like the l_c_d _ screen that is quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this . and the third thing is it should be easy to use . with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use . the personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like banana yellow , strawberry red and .", "marketing executive : . the round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber .", "marketing executive : it should be soft i it should feeling spongy or s sponge bob like things .", "marketing executive : th elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like woods dark brown , red , deep reds and . they liked square shapes with round edges . and hard materials like wood , titanium . they those materials they liked . this is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that . and then i th i personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like", "marketing executive : this . it is it is a bit like a banana . and the colour should be yellow , . and for the elderly people just plain old . because we decided to have two remotes , two designs , or was it two colours ?", "marketing executive : we should decide whether it is going to be with round shapes . like my colleague , you said , is that is e better , or for the elderly people something like the ipod , with round squares . simple but easy to use . so that is it .", "user interface designer : you could you could change the colours , that was also the idea . i which shape you should take ,", "user interface designer : i if you do it square , with round corners but a little in the middle of it i do what ?", "user interface designer : like this a bit . so it is a bit square , but it is also a bit round .", "user interface designer : but that is also how other remotes are shaped , so that is but perhaps that is a good thing , so that is easy to use . people know the", "marketing executive : they liked the wood a lot . so maybe we could give it like wooden loo look in that colour .", "marketing executive : those , those things . so you see the big difference between the young people ? fresh , exciting . and the old people , old and boring .", "marketing executive : because otherwise we have to get different shapes , and colour way easier than the shapes . in material rubber , rubber is , like i said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones and the old people like plain wood . so we have to decide if we are going to use real hard rubber , or soft rubber .", "marketing executive : or or wh what is something harder . no no but you have to like a eraser . that is the bit you can press it in , harder .", "marketing executive : it is quite hard but you can press it in . it is feels kind s spongy .", "industrial designer : i also s ca not help but notice that you used an you had a remote control and the l_c_d _ screen was rather small .", "user interface designer : but if you pu now you can put your hand there and then you wo not touch the screen .", "user interface designer : but not on the screen because that is an idea . looks a bit like a game boy now .", "industrial designer : because when you put your f but if yo if you make the l_c_d _ screen as large as the remote control itself , you will always get some", "marketing executive : but it wo not get that small because you have how much ? nine ten eleven twelve

at same time .", "industrial designer : they have thick fingers . but if you wanna make it in international , japanese people got rather small hands", "industrial designer : zoom opt , you can make it larger to with accompanying greater fields to push the button .", "project manager : and we wo not include a pen , to point , hey , we want to do it with our fingers , right ?", "project manager : but people want to use a remote with their fingers because th they are used to that", "user interface designer : this is a good size for the screen . i how large the actual remote should be but a little bit like this , .", "project manager : and maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , .", "project manager : maybe , if interrupt you , maybe i should show some points

executive : you have to go back . is not it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ?", "industrial designer : depends on the screen . if you make the screen vertical it does not matter . if you make it in a rectangle", "marketing executive : it is easier to have it something like a button minus here , plus over here . a minus here , plus over here . the other buttons and on here the top . the options and then you have something like the p _ over here ,", "user interface designer : i would put a plus and a min here . and then the p _ in the mid in the middle and the sound

could put it in a corner . you can talk into the corner .", "industrial designer : not even necessary , because a lotta you can make a very sensitive microphone , so it makes it possible to just put it arou underneath it or on the bottom of the remote .", "project manager : maybe at the bottom where you can hel hold it with you hand that there is also a microphone", "project manager : because it

control , so keep that in mind . we have forty minutes . the new project requirements , first of all , we did not speak about it , but we should not support teletext in the remote , because our b board feels that teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . so we are not even going to try to implement it in our product . it is a board decision . the remote control should only be used for television , because it is not f feasible , it is not w we can not make it because of the time to market that we have to deal with .", "project manager : the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than forty , which is important for you , ruud , and as for roo . because the product should be interesting and should be bought by people younger than forty

already mentioned in the previous discussion .", "user interface designer : and the ease - of - use remote control with the less p possibilities but a great feeling in touching the buttons . my

years old . so maybe the multi - function can be implemented in our design . but it should b it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not in our design . so it should take out , eight

there is a energy source here . and there it is connected to three things . the user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using infrared light ,

things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . it is cased together , nothing more than that . it is almost every piece of equipment every piece of every t_v _ set is controlled infrared . there are some exceptions , but most of all have infrared controls . and the more luxury remote controls have lithium buttons . and that is what we w", "industrial designer : yes . in the and it is a little more a little bit more fancy also . so maybe we should consider that . i have a basic scheme of the things which are implemented . this is all there is .

our plan to do this . so , so", "industrial designer : personally we should infra use infrared , because otherwise our device can not communicate with almost every t_v _ set . so that should be clear . another important point is we really should use energy sparse , friendly components . there are specially designed energy - friendly components which consume far less power than conventional components . and if we want to use a rechargeable design or a energy - save design , we should really implement them . for cost - effectiveness , we should really use a very low - cost circuit board ,

till true , . that they only use ten percent the buttons . the buttons to zap are used the about fifteen hundred times , when the power button is only used one time . and the volume button is only four times . so they are obv the most important buttons . and lots of people complained they kin ca not find their remote control . so we might want to build in a feature to support them . some audio

explore all these additional functions . so in that way it is advanced , and it is easy to use for both types of users .", "marketing executive : the p the most important function is easy to use . the

discuss a bit about the project , cost - wise how much money we had to s just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company is decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we do not really need to consider that in the functionality of the remote control . they have also suggested that we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r _ , d_v_d _ or anything else . the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it will affect how long it takes us to get it into production , the time to market . so , we are just gonna keep it simple and it will just control the t_v _ . and the other thing was that the company want the corporate

recap ?", "user interface designer : so this is the technical functions design . right to do the design i have i have had a look online , i have had a look at the homepage , which has given us some

the numbers .", "marketing executive : one way i would look at this would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of like control types , so that for the user it is very clear what they want to do where they go . and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible .", "marketing executive : if we had audio controls , those could be something

self - explanatory . so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , like one which are just the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . and others that are also available and then others that are concealed . something like that .", "project manager : just to wrap up quickly on this little section have lost no . , do you think maybe that is the only essential requirements , and then maybe just things that would be if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button , that thing . any of you anything to add to that ?", "marketing executive : no . so why do not pick up and move then . here , i will just why do not", "marketing executive : i am all in a knot now . so say already , whether this is for good or for bad but there will be a lot of redundancy in the issues and the things .", "marketing executive : which is ma not necessarily a bad thing , but may what i have already started doing is cr i created a slide in my presentation here so that we think what is the cumulative effect of what we have taken from your ideas and mine , because certainly i have a hard time separating things completely .", "marketing executive : what you have just told me impacts a lot on what like market research that i have been so how do i get this up ?", "marketing executive : great . just before i bring this up what i will just say is what i have done is tried to collect some information so that then relay this to you guys so that it is now becomes a collective thing . and then lead us in the direction of deciding , what are our options , what should we decide and do what , so .", "marketing executive : . that would be so does that make sense ? so what i got is looked into some information and th tried to think about how we could review it and how we could and what decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities . certainly there is lots of different information to go through . so i am thinking here about primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and w , what they want and what are issues with existing products . to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics . and then , as i say w we would like to prioritise our design features from this and", "marketing executive : dunno . so this is what i have found here , a lot of this is new to me , so we will just read through together . , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . so they find them ugly . most people find them ugly . the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as , we will see later , the vast majority would spend more money for slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . i am gonna we will look at that in a second . most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . so i what we are looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they do not does not really appeal to them . so what we are doing is we are trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different inspirations , one is that we want something that is high - tech but we want it to seem easy . and in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high - tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people is hands . they get lost a lot , s as it came up in our last meeting . , takes time to learn how to use them . this is why i mention when craig was showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so d it does not just look like a big panel , kinda like when you look at , a new computer keyboard , that is quite explanatory . if you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those . and i will admit i what r_s_i _ stands for .", "marketing executive : no , that did not come up . so here is another a review here of the main things . i also found that most people would adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . now we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . so if that is possible we might consider getting into it . and here as we move m thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that is fashionable and sleek and trendy . people additionally are not liking the appearance of their products , so we wanna think about as we take all the techie features how we can put that into a unit which is which people like . , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics .", "marketing executive : so just c looking at what craig craig is i ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and separate the different things that we wanna include in this . so if we do say we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . , it is like i find a lot of t_v_s these days , something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there is just like tons of features you go through .", "project manager : so it you wanna group all the different types of functions together , . that is", "marketing executive : that is that is the but i am my hope here is that i am putting out this information so that we can then say , how do we collectively move on with it . i have not brought out one specific marketing idea , although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that . but not let that confine us technologically .", "project manager : one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we are gonna be who is our target audience , our target market .", "project manager : so if we want something that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ?", "project manager : who wou who would have the money to spend . i if like twenty five euro is our selling price then you can imagine ,", "project manager : i do not i am not really how much that will retail at . but you want it is somebody who is not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , i suppose , they are gonna actually go out and buy one . so , who do you think we are aiming this at ?", "industrial designer : it will be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . twenty five euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ?", "industrial designer : is that too is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up - ish . i you pay , what , ten quid for a remote ? like a simple replacement , right . if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get , would you how much would you pay ?", "marketing executive : this this kinda touches on your comments there , david . these are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature . just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on t_v _ equipment is . mostly focused around the twenty five age group .", "project manager : do you think then voice recognition is something we should really consider ? what what do you think , craig ?", "user interface designer : did you not say it was the adults that were going for the voice recognition ? the older group .", "project manager : we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let is target these people and give them what they want and , there needs to be some selling point to it . so anybody anything there to add just young professionals , th like if we are going to include speech recognition , it is between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . so we could say that was our target .", "industrial designer : twenty five to thirty five is fair to add that in as a group as because that is more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology .", "project manager : so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . , they have bit of expendable income to spend on this thing .", "industrial designer : perhaps that age group is significant as because those are people who use the computer , who are familiar with their with computers in their everyday work . people who are maybe about i would not say thirty five , but people who are about forty - ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone like that .", "industrial designer : people who are u growing up used to , in schools and in universities , when you go on to their working lives , people who would regular", "project manager : that that is a good point . , so shall we make the decision to include speech recognition", "industrial designer : one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now ,", "industrial designer : because , based on what you have go y everybody is saying , right , you want something simple .", "industrial designer : you want basic and you want something that is easy to use . speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use .", "industrial designer : but what i am saying is that we are trying to lock ourselves into a s particular technology ,", "industrial designer : rather than focusing on exactly what are the features that we are gonna say , and then , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . so maybe we should i suggest that we think about speech recognition , anyway it is a it is something that can be used to fulfil a function , but at end of the day we do not look at the technology , but we look at the function first .", "project manager : and then we can i might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , but this is how we are", "project manager : exactly , . it is something that is just occurred to me as is if we make it speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that is appealing to people maybe with a physical disability as .", "marketing executive : not and not losing . and also it helps in terms of people not losing this , they are saying it is i lose it in the couch . like we are what we are b getting in into here is mating different design features together that they", "user interface designer : i reckon one problem with speech recognition is i have actually seen one of them used and the technology that was in that one was not particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours .", "project manager : do you think maybe we need like further advances in that area until it is worthwhile incorporating it though ?", "industrial designer : . this is just the working design . this is just what how i would go about it . i try to define like what we are doing now , try to define what we are trying to get done . in a practical way , we it is . we have used it , we are familiar with it , but we are we ca not n we have not narrowed down exactly what the things we are trying to fulfil , like besides the basics , back in the back of our minds we the basics are . has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ? and the idea is just to get everybody to i usually have a design that is there as a basic , so , things that to start everything going . but i everybody does have some idea , so i do not think there is a need for that . this finding things is a little bit confusing , so i will go into the diagram first . it just explains how the process goes through , from a from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . you need some power source . , a battery , to keep it going . and that power source is important because it ties you down to how long the device will last . it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want . like , voice recognition , right . that might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that is one perhaps constraint there . th , the basic thing is there is a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever . , and that picks up an input from a user , a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r , based on you push button a _ , so i will do something with button a _ . so maybe button a _ is the power button , . and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here . and that is about it in terms of my design . it is fairly general , and i the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in the way you are thinking , like voice recognition , right , if it is something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we do not have enough power . so it is not really a constraint in that sense , but these are functionally , the base , what the technology has to do . so i the rest of it we should maybe you wanna go back to what the functions are ? that is more relevant to a discussion ?", "industrial designer : more or less . ps , it is just putting the rest of it into words , but it is essentially the same thing . you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip , like that .", "marketing executive : since we are on the topic of the technology , are there any like what are our options ? alright , what is what i in is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin", "industrial designer : these are not technology options in that sense . this is just a basic principles and basic components that are needed .", "industrial designer : if you needed to add a voice recognition , right , then your user interface would be split , broken down into more components , right , which you have a microphone , the v_r _ and like that .", "industrial designer : so each component represents one function , but the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , and the receiver , and the power are things that you wo not have to care about . and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we will add more functionality to it . there might be one other consideration which would be that the transmission between the remote control and the t_v _ . , are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra - red thing ? because that is something you need to actually be physically be pointing to .", "project manager : a worry that was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect how long it took us to get this to market , so i th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about how we transmit it because it is tried and tested intra - red , so we could stay with tha", "industrial designer : there might be one other problem with the transmission , in particular right now , since we are talking about voice recognition . if somebody is gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them .", "industrial designer : i it you may not require that , but , it is something very natural , i , to hold it , to signal to the user ,", "industrial designer : and push a button maybe to start s talking about it . then you need to send the signal out , so because if you are using infra - red , the line of sight say the t_v _ is at that chair , and i am standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . so in that sense , there is not really a restriction but it is something which you may have to think about later on in the process . not so much further down .", "marketing executive : and just a clarification before we finish this . does c is our controller is it have the option of being on a standard frequency as all of the other equipment , so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ?", "industrial designer : but that one indication of infra - red mean that you are just targeting traditional devices . because infra - red is something which everybody has .", "project manager : w we have in the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the t_v _ ,", "project manager : so that is what we should do for now . something i was wondering about was the power . , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? is that something we really want to go into , do you think ,", "industrial designer : from a component point of view there is added complexity , and you add cost to it , and then there is probably the fact that you need another physical component . you need a docking cradle , for you to put it in to charge . or you need to get the user to plug it in . and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller .", "industrial designer : but unless the controller is gonna consume a lot of batteries , like he is gonna run through like twenty batteries a month , then i do not think rechargeable is something we should , we really need to care about .", "project manager : so just stick to regular so the i am just gonna just recap what i said at the start , was that the whole point of this meeting was to f finalise who we are gonna aim this at , and what exactly the product is gonna do . so just to recap on are we all happy about the idea of aiming the product at the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? and also the funct the actual functions of what it is gonna do .", "user interface designer : we just say that it was gonna be the most basic possible . on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and skip to a channel .", "marketing executive : and is it going to include any of the more advanced features , or are we gonna eliminate those ?", "user interface designer : we include mute , but apart from that we just we will go for the simpleness .", "marketing executive : r is it s is it not an option still that we include some things just as a under like under a door or some", "marketing executive : what i am i would be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then they , w they get ours and w it is does not have that . if that would be a problem .", "industrial designer : another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? maybe i could suggest we break them down into three simple categories . one would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be a device . this may not map very to advanced functionality especially , but that from a manufacturer is point of view , from a person designing the device , but from a point of view of a person using the device , a t_v _ is something they see and something they hear , it is something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , like if we want this feature , let is throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it is basic , or it is non - basic . it might help with the visualisation .", "project manager : i got ta got five minutes to wrap up now . next thing we are doing is having lunch . and then we are gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage . so i will be putting the minutes of this meeting into the project documents folder . so to confirm that we we are doing in the next in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , for our industrial designer , you are gonna be thinking about the components concept . user interface designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , and marketing you are gonna be thinking about trend watching . and you will all get specific instructions as . so , just to ask now if you have got anything else you have thought about while we have been talking . , do you wanna start with david . anything else to say ?", "marketing executive : just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , shall we agree for sake of clarity and when we r resume that we will u use this idea david is proposed , where we think of these three buckets and anything we discuss about them is , we are talking about this .", "industrial designer : things like on off . because they do not have anything to do with what you see . i me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value , so", "industrial designer : and channel . because the on off also goes , like on off like power , not on off sound . not on off video . although you do not turn off the video on your t_v _ , but you might wanna turn off the sound , say you wanna pick up the phone , there is a mute button , right , so you have a choice of putting it on to others or a device . device is anything which we ca not categorise , right . we put it out .", "project manager : so you are gonna have audio which is gonna be like your bass settings and actual volume hi", "industrial designer : anything to do with what you hear , right . you you put that into audio . and then video is anything that you can see .", "project manager : and then visual , so brightness , contrast , things like that , and then just actual device things ,", "marketing executive : and then k i suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more", "industrial designer : like random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there .", "industrial designer : even if it does not map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind . it is easy to use , that is one thing that and i from the component point of view it is easy to build as things are like fixed .", "project manager : so , things to think about are like the fact it is got ta look good , because of who we are , targeting this at . something maybe quirky in design maybe . make it ergonomic to hold , things like that . so i that is it . that is the meeting over .", "marketing executive : great . then we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us ."],

executive : it kinda does make sense , does not it , because when we get into the end of meeting we are talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything i have is kinda background .", "project manager : we all ready to go ? how on the in this meeting then if we i will just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . and we decided on our target group being fifteen to thirty five ,", "project manager : and we decided that it was gonna be non - rechargeable battery - powered , that we are gonna group our audio - visual and other functions into those categories , . and i told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the t_v _ , and trying to incorporate the corporate colour and slogan . so that was the last meeting .", "project manager : so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to that you are gonna want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we will have all the discussion at the end . that might be a better idea this time . and so if we start off with andrew and then craig and then david , if that is alright . and then after that we will have to make some decisions about , right . so if you wanna take this .", "project manager : screwed in quite tightly . what did how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? we did we say we were gonna try maybe incorporate it but we had not made a definite decision on that ? i should also point out that the final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product . so that is the end result hopefully .", "marketing executive : great s so let me just start this . where would it all go ?", "marketing executive : it is not good . lemme just see where find it . this looks more like it . opened up the template .", "marketing executive : so this was the method that i have taken . what i wanna do here , before we get into it too far , is i want to show you all the background information i have that we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful . and and then sorta g go through some of the way that i have dealt with that information , and then bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision . so i have tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify trends that are in sync and are important to our p project plan that we have so far , and then initiate a discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to narrow in on aspects that will inform other elements of the project . does that make sense , tha that strategy ?", "marketing executive : that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that is why i suggested we get in this .", "marketing executive : so out of different figures and ratings ob of people in general , consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , and not , it specified , not a functional look or feel , b f fancy . however , this is where we kinda have to be very , creative about it . number two was that it be innovative . so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary functional bits to it . and third priority for ease of use , so again that gives us a general picture of how it has to be , quite user friendly while still having technology . so it i will just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that what we should think about is how the about how the innovation contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it .", "marketing executive : like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up , what , like , or it is got something else to it that just seems innovative because the thing that the message here is ease of use . so how do you make innovation make something more easy to use ? that is i where we are gonna go with this . then there is the other aspect of the back the market research i have here is on fashion style , which as we have is a priority . top european fashion trend that i read about says there is this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , especially in clothes and furniture . and when i first saw that , do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it , do what ? so my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . what we are in is partly home decor , partly something like a computer , so we might wanna be careful about how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple , that would be pushing it . and then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and , you might say ergonomic or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was not the case . so probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year is mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , that will be in our favour . so these this is the summary of everything . style is number one thing in the market of who we are selling to . innovative design technology is also a must in that it is seen it would be seen to be cutting edge , but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . that was like the number three thing . and then at the end there are vibrant natural colours that is the way i interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so i have written at the bottom to give us a context of discussion , mac ipods , something which is , i would have to say very high - tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there is like no buttons .", "marketing executive : what a mac ipod is ? i am thinking however mac ipod is last year is because it is very hard and glassy and glossy , so i am thinking if we imagine that we are taking some of the features of a mac ipod and we are then making it s more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have . and then so this is w with all that information what i am suggesting in this slide here is that we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more techni like production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . like a like we think of some a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , sorta like a marketing identity . does that make sense ? so so like i threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , green colours , pe whatever , it is just an idea , i am thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that .", "marketing executive : like the ones which i am most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like lemon like that , something which is , like you see a lot in other areas . like i see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and so anyway it is just an idea . i am thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like something to do with like lighting within it . like just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it lights up , q usually the buttons light up . how can we build on that ? maybe like it could light up in different colours or people could buy the control and then it comes with different like covers so . anyway those are that is all i have ,", "user interface designer : and so think of this concept . to research it i have had a look on the homepage again . it is provided me with more examples of previously existing c remote controls . there is a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , so i have taken the suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this so then this we are looking for suggestions on size th size of control and the buttons , the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control . what i found from the research is that most the current controls are just big bricks with loads of buttons all over them . they are not very attractive to look at , and they are not very comfortable to hold , they are hold 'em like big bricks , and they are very easily lost . they tend to be very dark colours , so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you ca not really see them . the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme . , the stand - by button is not always red , it really should be . it is something the user then identify with . this is a red switch off , that is how it should be . i am not if there is any other examples of that , but something to look out for . there is a problem that i have got couple of preferences for the end control i get 'em with the red colour button for stand - by and s the other examples of that the buttons should be large . they should not be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones . they should be easy to press , very comfortable . one of the examples given on the homepage was there is an up and down volume button but both of them have a v _ on them , so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that is kinda confusing . should avoid s things like that . if the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere . trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could tie - in very easily with your lime and lemon idea .", "project manager : because like the website is yellow and there is a band at the bottom is yellow ,", "user interface designer : any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , they should not be on the should not be visible without something be opened or some special extra effort . if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative , possibly hidden in the opened up section making that something is wrong with it or with somebody is voice , maybe they got a cold or we should definitely avoid the big square block look . that is just wrong . and we got an email from it is the research department , and they have said th the voice control can now talk back if you ask it a question . so it sh it could be good to have them confirm any action you take", "user interface designer : and possibility . right and these are problems i have had with it . i where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is . it is , fashion into electronics . and we how flexible the colour scheme is . you say you wanted the corporate colours , but they do not say if we can use any other colours or that is it .", "marketing executive : it is a shame the cable was not just in the middle of the table ,", "industrial designer : that should be it . i the same thing again , i started with something very basic . so just so you guys have some idea of what is involved in my process , and then you can just work through it and we will either modify it or start from scratch depending on what your needs are . the components are exactly the same . , like what you guys said , the most input that is needed is in the user interface . the rest of the components they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity . like you said time to market was a problem , and how many components are physically in there in cost . and the power is a factor of that . and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , they affect you in terms of the size of your device , and that would have some inte impact on how y more how you hold rather than the actual use using the remote control because like we have said we have defined , like we only want the basic things that to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide . so it is just a matter of working out space . so i three things , cost , complexity , and the size . these are the three things that will have an impact on you . so just go through it in the components . these are the options that are available to you , i am not very about the voice thing i got another email and it was quite sketchy on what n the voice options are .", "industrial designer : it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . i it said something about a sensor but never clarified that . so maybe if you i could see the other email that they sent you , they got back to me with like different requirements , or different offerings of what components availa so your basic components are buttons , and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel , there is an l_c_d _ display , these are quite standard things .", "industrial designer : no they are in the sense that these are all the options available for you . i will explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later . then there is how the case actually looks . it can actually be flat or it can be curved , and then the different types of materials that you can use , i do not think you can use them in a combination , but i could check back for you , but i do not think you can actually use them in a combination .", "industrial designer : plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , i was not i am not very about the titanium . they had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium . the rubber was a restriction on the power source you could use , but the titanium had a different things on the shape of the thing , so that there is some restriction on you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , but it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one . as opposed to two . and the other components are logic chips , again i will go back to the component chips . the com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the unit and that impacts cost . i do not think the logic chip has a issue about size they should be about the same size . power consumption should be about the same . the main impact is complexity , and the other thing is the power options . the first one is a standard battery . the second one is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , it is a wind - up , a crank .", "industrial designer : but that might be something that is more of a look and feel decision because i do not think you can have one power source if you are using the alternative power sources . whatever it is you still need a battery i do not think anybody wants to keep doing one thing .", "industrial designer : the other ones are a solar powered cell , which may not be a great idea in europe or any country that has seasons half the year you would be dead . so like what i said , you probably need like a battery and something else . and the kinetic one i for me is the most interesting one because it is movement and people like to fiddle with their and it is a sales gimmick . from a marketing gimmick it is a technology thing , it is a shake it does not work , shake it , knock it .", "industrial designer : you have you had those balls , those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it lights up and it goes ,", "industrial designer : that might be a gimmick combined with rubber . just to if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it , just so .", "industrial designer : my from my role , i do not think that personal preferences but role preferences , something comfortable to hold , small and slim i that is more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you ca not , like a phone , too small phone . and the other thing is from a production point of view the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it so .", "industrial designer : let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions . the user interface restrictions means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard , the l_c_d _ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic . the case with a rubber case you ca not have the solar panels . with the titanium case , let me just check that , titanium case ca not be curved , it has to be square . there is no restriction on the plastic , and", "industrial designer : it ca not be curved on the wood . so that is again , i do not think you can use them in a combination , especially the titanium i suspect they are very fixed to a particular need . so mixing them may not be a good idea .", "project manager : it is just i am quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we have left so but you c ask away .", "marketing executive : can we power a light in this ? can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ?", "industrial designer : we could because the l_c_d _ panel requires power , and the l_c_d _ is a form of a light so that", "marketing executive : so maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery .", "marketing executive : i am thinking it might be that for this to be a high - tech thing it is gonna have to have something high - tech about it and that is gonna take battery power , and to make that a realistic goal one of the issues that will come up later is , can the battery power it ?", "industrial designer : are you thinking are you thinking of a light in the sense of a light , or a light in the sense of it glows frankenstein , it is alive .", "marketing executive : illuminate the buttons . m i am thinking along the lines of you are in the dark watching a d_v_d _ and you find the thing in the dark and you go like this , and that is what everybody does . where is the volume button in the dark , and y you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up .", "marketing executive : like a phone , . whereas with phones , people charge them once a week . we are gonna need to put in a really good battery so people do not have to charge their r remote control every few days .", "industrial designer : that is why the option of the kinetic thing which means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch", "industrial designer : so you could trigger that to a light , like i said the bouncing ball thing , or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up , right , and then that sorta triggers the", "project manager : let is just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start , and just giving an i d idea on the time , we have got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . so so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the concepts of the product . so back to your idea about incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that . what does everybody think about does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together ? that is the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ?", "user interface designer : we could go for like maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very curvy type shape . you could have the same texture and colour as a fruit .", "project manager : so maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you would hold onto comfortably or", "user interface designer : probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , feels right in your hand .", "project manager : so something quite curvy ? colour - wise you made a re was it you or i ca not remember who made the point about how if you have a bright colour you will not lose it , was that", "project manager : about how if you have a bright colour you will not lose it so much . and when the corporate colour is yellow , maybe we could think about the colour of the whole product being yellow i . and then the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what might work ?", "marketing executive : i am thinking that what we need to do is have something that unifies a lot of the different concepts , and if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is the look and feel . so for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and pieces of concept and technology or whatever or fashion , then we should have it come back to one thing that we all sorta can visualize . maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the colour , you said company colour yellow . if we think of something , like i was saying also lime and lemon , what can we come up with something where we try and associate it with like the series . we just come up with something like that we use it as a theme to inspire the shapes and things .", "industrial designer : is there a particular shape that you are interested in ? like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long ? does it need with a square thing wha", "industrial designer : like fruit . i am thinking fruits in my head , but that is tacky .", "project manager : and they are plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels warmer to the touch . it feels a bit more comfortable , and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it . and then we could have curved shapes , wood or titanium , it is gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and we might be moving away from that so i am do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or", "marketing executive : it is more just that we think about like what it is we are trying to achieve , so and then we have one sorta theme that we stick with .", "user interface designer : so a p larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need .", "user interface designer : something like that you got two groups there maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside", "project manager : so call it the snowman - shape trademark . and colour - wise what does everybody think ? it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . do you want the whole thing yellow , maybe like yellow and white do you want something", "user interface designer : so i reckon it would look quite if we just had this here , had a sorta background yellow , and then have a bold colour for the buttons .", "project manager : and also how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? the fact that it talks to you , it might be quite if when you first start using it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics , or when you like or if you turn it off if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere .", "project manager : i know . unless an a if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate an l_c_d _ display , where would we put that ? would we put that on the inside or", "industrial designer : do we need an l_c_d _ display ? what what is the functionality of that ?", "project manager : it is bound to increase the cost of it a lot , i would have thought .", "industrial designer : what would we achieve from it ? putting in lights is cheap but putting in an l_c_d _ panel just to make it glow is a bit of a", "marketing executive : l_c _ i would when you used to mention the l_c_d _ i would think i wonder what that would be about . and the th the thing i could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with listings . so as you scroll through , we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is .", "industrial designer : that will be a problem because we do not have an input device to get the listings into it ,", "industrial designer : i am not saying there is no need for an l_c_d _ display , but it is what is what would it tell the user ,", "industrial designer : the l_c_d _ tends to be an output as opposed to an input so does the remote control need to talk back to the user ?", "industrial designer : we have the option of the speaker as the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there a need for the remote control to talk back ?", "project manager : no i would say no need for a talk - back . does anybody disagree with that ?", "project manager : so you are gonna have the three different sets of functionalities , do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you are thinking ?", "user interface designer : the advanced ones the ones you do not usually use could be hid inside . b the we had were fairly basic ones , they would have to go on the front somewhere .", "industrial designer : where would you physically position the buttons ? that has some impact on many things . maybe you wanna draw onto the", "project manager : so i am just gonna pop this in here i have a slide about decision making which i would forgotten about . sh god we have got five minutes back we go . energy what do you think that is suggesting we are how we are powering the thing ? i really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you would have the back - up of the battery , but have kinetic power ,", "marketing executive : i have had kinetic things before , and the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you are committing the user to moving it ,", "industrial designer : no , like i said we have a h hybrid thing , so it is not gonna charge the battery , it is just", "marketing executive : and watches right , . support for it . just it is just worth pointing out because like i have known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time , and it is just like magic because it is always powered and there is no battery . i have also known people to have things like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time , and they eventually just say it is just too much of a nuisance because i do not wear it all the time . like remote control is similar , you are away on vacation , whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down .", "project manager : i suppose that if you are away and you are not using it , then you are not using any power either .", "project manager : so you would have the battery as the to keep it ticking over idea i am really we are gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we do not have as much time as . so that is what energy is referring to here . chip on print , is that is an industrial design thing , is it david ?", "marketing executive : and this size here , i would suggest this be small , like quite small .", "marketing executive : just a lot of the one of the things running through my mind right now , i realise we are being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low - tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it is almost like we are reproducing the same old remote control that is out there . should we think about how we are actually getting this high - tech user friendly theme like what is it that we are u we are using to achieve those goals ?", "industrial designer : or even a clear case . a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable ,", "industrial designer : but in the dark it , it is alive . in a slight subtle way .", "project manager : s so like cur slightly transparent case , so it is yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it .", "industrial designer : you have cordless mice and they do not eat that much power right . so the power the battery in that sense , maybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights that", "industrial designer : but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , does not make it freaky .", "marketing executive : and then the other thing that we are s we have committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so i am thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like some an innovative concept about how the volume and the channels are controlled , that is the main thing people will f wanna do . could we use like a jog dial , like a just round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ?", "industrial designer : the question is when you are rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ?", "industrial designer : do you want 'em to roll it like that ? in a mouse your hand is in a position to roll it , whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally .", "project manager : if you are holding it in your hand you could do that , could not you ?", "industrial designer : can you imagine you have to scroll a lot . it might work for volume , and maybe some of the brightness controls and like that , but not for channels right . if you have a telewest box you have got like , you do not have to buy all the channels , you have about fifty channels , can you imagine trying to . and i do not think having that too quick too slow kin it is confusing to the", "user interface designer : but then for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to skip the channel button , the number part .", "industrial designer : but users tend to want to use that and once they lose out on the user experience they are like because that is becomes the most accessible thing in front of", "marketing executive : because when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button . jog dials are much easier than that .", "project manager : we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in and quickly . i am all for them actually , they are quite th very quick to m to use . so does anybody oppose the idea of incorporating one into the design ? and the other thing was can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ?", "marketing executive : if we keep coming back to this board here , i would not be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , that it is within the shape of the hand , it is quite small", "marketing executive : it is small , and that we have got like the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side ,", "marketing executive : and that is not that what we just h said we s just have to decide now ?", "marketing executive : and then like a jo and then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like here , in with the", "industrial designer : that that might have one problem in terms of whether you are left handed or you are right handed you might be locking yourself in .", "marketing executive : it would get bumped , it is does not really fit with your hand . or maybe just fit it in like down the middle here .", "project manager : i am really gonna have to hurry you on here we are actually over time . is there anything anybody is unsure about ?", "project manager : just for in closing just the next meeting is gonna be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing , i know that the designers are gonna be working with play - doh on that . so that will be good . and i will get the minutes up as soon as possible . anything you think we have not discussed that we need to ? is everybody happy about what they are gonna be doing ?", "industrial designer : one thing would be the jog dial that is gonna have quite a big impact on the thing", "marketing executive : the jog dial , it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it ,", "industrial designer : a slide , because then you do not have to put the hand . incorporating a logo is quite straight forward . there is lots of space for it", "marketing executive : and materials we sorta said we would do plastic and rubber , did not we , and maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , that would just be so standard .", "marketing executive : something a bit more flush , or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as , so that it has and also t plastic i have seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand .", "marketing executive : they feel like , you get pens now and then that you would think that they were rubber but they are not ,", "project manager : i am gonna have to call this to a close we are way over time . so that is really good , like we have s had much to talk about that run out of time to do so . so off you go and design wooh .", "industrial designer : you got to choose first . no , we are kidding . , can swipe your power cable , i do not think it matters . lemme , i am gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left . this is a real hassle and a i am

greater degree you get in these three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different the diff the different things that it is designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one macro to turn the t_v _ to the right channel , get the re rewind the tape in the v_c_r _ and get it to play once it is rewound , . b it occurs to me there might

disagrees we can definitely say so . and hopefully we will just crack on and we will get everything going . i would like to if possible hear from our marketing expert first , to help us gain an idea of where we are going to go . i will just load up your presentation from here if you want .", "project manager : if you that is all right . if you do you want me to just cycle through it for you or ?", "marketing executive : functional requirement by me ebenezer . , so we did some research , we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . we asked some open ended questions , just , what are your opinions on the remote control , got a lot of re responses , and we asked some very specific questions , and we got a lot of good feedback . bear in mind this is only a hundred people , so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there is only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group . so we got some the bad we got , remotes are often lost . i often lose my remote control , the back of the couch , some place , and even if it is not lost permanently , it takes me a few minutes to find it . most buttons are not used any more , like you said , teletext is outdated now . i remember trying to load a d_v_d _ player recently , and there were so many buttons , it took me i maybe ten minutes to go through each button , you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons , there is just a lot of that no one really uses . and if they do , not very often . takes too long to master the remote control . i have seen some remote controls that are big , they have a lot of buttons , you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something , they are just not great to use . we just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls , people do not like remote controls . some of the good we got . between the age of fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . now do not get excited yet , i have got more to say on that . most peoplewould be willing to pay for that most people want remote controls to be pretty , they want it to be fancy , th they want it to be different , everybody has a white remote control with black buttons , and a red button and a green button , not everybody wants that . finally , my opinion . the voice recognition thing is . and voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . it is a bit sketchy at some times , you are not gonna get good always accurate results , but for a very fixed number of words , you have , how many different words can you have for a remote control , up , down , left , right , channel five , channel seven , how many , you ca not have that many words . for a fixed vocabulary it works quite . i am pretty people would buy it . but after a while people may wanna return it , because if you have to say som most people use a remote control for switching to channels , and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , and that is for flickering through channels . so if you have to say up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it . however , because the voice recognition software exists already , there is no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . but if we do have the voice recognition thing , there is a lot of that you can get rid of . see , you could there are two options . either you have voice recognition by itself , which is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet , or i you have a visitor coming round and the remote is only trained for you , it is a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . so you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . but imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , it could be as fancy as you want it to be , it could be like a lollipop like that , something weird like that . as long as the voice recognition works , that is fine .", "marketing executive : we have the three birds , we have the design , that we have the fancy bit , right , the voice recognition is fancy , it is different , it is radical , so , and then we have an extra bit i do not remember so i am pretty people will buy the remote , but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , is a big question . , will people be willing to for the period that it will take to train the remote , it will the remote will get better over time with the same user , but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to , are you willing to have a bad remote control . and what if you have visitors come round , they stay the night , they wanna use the t_v _ , they ca not use the remote because they speak differently to you . , how do you account for regional accents and like that . , will people return the remote control , a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , so ,", "marketing executive : do our audience have the money , but would they return it after a while because it is not as fast as pressing a button , it is not a practical . these are things we should consider .", "project manager : sor if you could speed it up a bit , . if you could speed it up a bit , .", "marketing executive : i am ? i am about to end , . it is but there are definitely some considerations .", "project manager : right . hear from the user interface designer now might be an idea . , you have got your presentation now ,", "user interface designer : this is a brief run through of the technical functions of the remote . as is the presentation is already slightly obsolete because i had in mind something that would be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices but there is still of relevance , so press on . i have looked at a num couple of other remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles . and was not really satisfied by what i saw i have to say so this is more springboard for how these could be improved on . the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set . to save you getting off your backside . and there is two main trends in th in the design practice . on the one hand and this particularly relates to its earliest models where with i so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set . giving you every possible function that the device has , the remote control controls . and most of these functions are not going to be used , it creates a rather user unfriendly interface . and on the other hand there is a user focused approach that pares things down to just what is most likely to get used . with a and there is a certain amount of loss of function here , but mostly that is relatively peripheral functions . and so you go for something that is fairly intuitive to use , and f the for the most part for t_v _ remote it is tha that would be channel control and volume . and if you are wanting to incorporate control of a d_v _ d_v_d _ or v_c_r _ presumably into that then there is a play , pause , stop , rewind , fast - forward , record , . my own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design . but the pro the problem with a lot of the user focused designs that are about is that they make assumptions in advance about what a given user is going to want mo want to do from want it to do most . so , something that is something that is more programmable , that perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you are most likely to want . so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls , i liked ebenezer is idea of including a joystick in that and possibly a fairly minimal number of function buttons , and have a disp you then have some basic display on it so that if you are cha changing from different modes for the device it will tell you just exactly what each direction of the joystick is going to do or wha or what each function button is going to do . , this is actually a again slightly taking inspiration off of games controllers , the playstation control where you have four basic function buttons that are just marked with distinctive geometrical shapes but the and then dependent on what you are doing with it what game and so on those functions are then further specified . and so it is taking the lead from that .", "industrial designer : i was still working on , i had not got it finished . click to save in where do i have to save it ?", "project manager : if you look on the desktop you will find that there is a link to the project folder , or project documents . if you save it in there we can open it up from here .", "industrial designer : right . , right i am responsible for working design , this is the inside going on of the remote control . so we have the energy source , we have the user interface , this is what i have seen . the sender will push the button , the chip will respond , and then the dig digital signal is sent to the t_v _ . so , if you go to next slide , you will see what do we need on the user interface . do we need many buttons , or do we need l many light bulbs that could be easier to realise which appliances are on or not . , or would that take too much power , would we need more components in there to supply the power ? , the joystick is another thing , if we were gonna add that , there would be more components to deal with that .", "industrial designer : so we need to exactly what that is the design of the layout of the electronic design , there will be more details once we have decided what we are putting on the user interface . that will be decided , i . , and the next slide . , if you go to the next slide then . used the it was a mess , i was just putting adding it together at the end there .", "industrial designer : so you have the energy source connected to the chip , and the user interface contains everything . you have the switch turn it on , infrared bulb , will contact the t_v _ and will have whatever device or d_v_d _ player , the bulb will turn on to say it is on . do we need on the control different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs , would it be easier ? , what we should decide on that .", "project manager : . , right we can probably skip that for now . so , we have had some put forward , along with the new user requirements , we have had a lot of input i would say so far . i hear what the marketing expert is saying about voice activated control . however i have got a couple of worries about that . the power required , and the ability to the cost , it seems like for an embedded system , this could us issues .", "project manager : you see that there is fairly robust services on computers via voice , i_b_m _ do drag and dictate , but these require a lot of memory and usually state quite advanced processor requirements . voice activation could be an interesting idea but that our ind industrial designer would probably upon some research say that it is maybe not feasible . that is just my view right now , however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an l_c_d _ which has been put forward so far , it is almost like having a small t _ not t_v _ to say , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , i how much power an l_c_d _ would take , but it might be quite low ?", "industrial designer : l_c_d _ on the remote just telling you what is on , or , interactive l_c_d _ or", "project manager : literally if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than those on a mobile phone , something where you can read an fair amount of information , traverse maybe quite a few menus , if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example , they usually incorporate they have the keypad , and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around . that could be one possibility . and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels", "user interface designer : i was thinking that the remote the default functions for the joystick would be up and down for volume , left and right for channels .", "industrial designer : do you think that people will get mixed up , like , they will be looking at this screen and that screen and then , trying to get everything working , would it be a bit confusing ?", "user interface designer : probably for the first couple of hours of using it but muscle memory is a wonderful thing , . and and that size of display was about what i had in mind . though i w i would say that we could probably be required to mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white .", "user interface designer : si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down . colour could be a subsequent development but cost a bit of extra money f w once everyone is got the first , colour is out , we will have to replace it wo not we . it does nothing extra .", "project manager : that would be my feeling as , we could possibly create quite a useful user interface . now i do not", "marketing executive : but the idea of a remote with a menu or and a joystick like i h if i was in the habit of buying remote controls then i would want one ,", "marketing executive : but we do not have a specific audience , like what is our target audience , what niche are we trying to market and corner . what i am saying , like , for whom is this intended ?", "project manager : it could probably be aimed at most people who have used a mobile . and that might be just another way of saying try to target most people .", "project manager : if we are if we were to follow that avenue , we might be s we are almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone i suppose . but that does cover a very large section of the people out there .", "project manager : i imagine as that the actual l_c_d _ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as would be for the additional functionality . which maybe does not get used as often , maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it . and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down , it depends , maybe we have the fol the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , that there is just a small number of as you were saying buttons that have already been defined . so like we go for the standard up and down for and volume control . so that literally anybody can come along , pick up the remote and still do . and they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the t_v _ and who would normally use the unit .", "user interface designer : . i th the thing i like about the joystick is that you then you can then put it for t _ for t_v _ remote alone , you could put there are like i say the main things people do with a t_v _ remote control is the volume and the channel . you can pack all that onto was onto a single control . but but the but then o if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you then get to menu navigation . with things like ch with things like tuning and channels adjusting brightn brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most t_v_s these days actually have menus anyway so this would be a fairly rational way of integra integrating the remote with the device it is controlling . concern about our market . , if we are most of the replacement remote market is remote control rationalisation . , you have got twenty different devices in your living room ,", "user interface designer : you want one wo y you want one that will do the job of all of them . , if all you are replacing is one of the however many remotes you have in your living room , you still need separate remotes for everything else . think that possibly", "project manager : this is a requirement that we have to stick to i am afraid , this is not one that i have just arbitrarily decided on . this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed , for now . understand your point , and i would agree with you , but this is our design spec for now . ' fraid to say .", "project manager : i would say so , yes , because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes , and that is a separate unit . that it i would say that the design spec we have been with is for the television only for now .", "user interface designer : just a thought . maybe then our market should be t_v _ manufacturers , rather than the public . try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with", "project manager : there is that possibility , yes . b however i exactly where we will be going with that , but it might not even be the avenue of the marketing expert , that might be sales , who are not in this meeting .", "marketing executive : it is just , the way i figure it , twelve point five euros per unit , we have to sell at least like three million like that , not to account for all the money we waste on remotes that no one buys , like if we made a perf if we made a ks for every remote we made someone bought it , then we have to sell a lot of remote controls . we just is this gonna be enough to sell ?", "project manager : something else that you brought up was the ability to lose a remote , which as you said you have done , we have probably all done . , i if it is a gimmick or not , but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle , it will beep and you tell you where it is .", "marketing executive : i had one of those , and my brother , and my dad , could have beat me up because it went off all the time accidentally .", "project manager : i was going to say clapping , digital telephones , one unit has you have to have that base unit , somewhere where there is a button , but maybe it is a button that you attach to the t_v _ .", "project manager : something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit .", "project manager : and that way , because we are attaching what would be a small button to the t_v _ , again say what , it would be a small transmitter , watch battery type scenario i would say , that if it was problems enough you could actually even just i do not power that might be something that we could look into . it is putting a lot on your shoulders there , so that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as .", "project manager : to go on from here . we have to decide exactly what we are going to do with the remote . before we leave this meeting , it would be best to say this is what we are going this is the design we are gonna try and get , this is how we are gonna make ourselves look unique . do we go for maybe a remote contro we are gonna go for a remote control , do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , and then , what , another button that would say that it is now being used to manoeuvre round the l_c_d _ .", "industrial designer : we are just saying volume . should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ?", "project manager : we could use say the left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume ,", "marketing executive : but we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most . , power is used like once per hour ,", "marketing executive : channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour , that is by far the biggest one , and then teletext , is still here , that is like fourteen ,", "project manager : the teletext we are gambling with , and we are gonna say it is dead , the way of the dodo", "project manager : so we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , l_c_d _ , and then what maybe is it one more button to say that you are using the menu system , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say ? so we are having very few buttons involved ,", "user interface designer : actually i would say maybe two function buttons , the y we are now using the menus button and an og and an button . certainly something i have found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for . or vice versa . and that is really irritating . the o the other dis design constraint we should bear in mind is that people are very much used to using a remote control one handedly , so we need to make that e even with the joystick , something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb .", "project manager : we are actually that sounds like a rough idea . do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ? do you mind looking ?", "marketing executive : because it is so small it might be an if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have that", "project manager : the ability to locate it again . so that would require a transmitter maybe attached to the t_v _ , just so that it says find me , and what , a small microphone on the actual unit , can maybe hide it in the base .", "industrial designer : and a light bulb ? nah , you would see it anyway , if you hear it .", "project manager : th e the true fact , considering the cost of an l_e_d _ , we could just incorporate it anyway . the l_e_d_s can be surprisingly bright now .", "project manager : by the sounds of it , with what we are suggesting so far , your design the user interface is still quite open , you could go for quite an interesting design . because we are only going to have a very few key and you have got a small l_c_d _ , joystick , e it leaves you open to a potential wide range of shapes , something that can make it stand out slightly . if you could look into what we have suggested so far , the feasibility of small transmitter , and such , maybe if an l_c_d _ screen requires too much power , or such . ebenezer , marketing expert", "marketing executive : give you the frequency , what people what options people use most often , i that is gonna be important in the ts defining the software side of the interface , right .", "project manager : if you could maybe as see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we have taken , where of a joystick to control the very basic functions , and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile . i how easy that will be within the time frame , but could be something we could maybe look into . any last comments that anybody would like to put forward ? anything that they think has been missed out . bit of a wide open question there . feel free to email me if you think that we have screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible .", "industrial designer : so i should just look at the speaker , the speaker and an l_e_d _ .", "user interface designer : actually one wee thought about that . , if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the transmitter could actually be built into the television .", "project manager : getting the external power source , that is quite true . , and something that we can easily be adopted at the last minute as i would say . the electronics could be s either placed externally or internally , makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control , so that is good .", "user interface designer : if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y we will have that , save us the bother , then that is vast amounts of sales . quite quickly .", "project manager : one thing that we have almost not talked about , my apologies for that , user interface , we also need to maybe get the slogan in here , it is ,", "project manager : i am pointing at my laptop , what in god real reaction , and such .", "industrial designer : the slogan is the slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , is not it ?", "project manager : my apologies . it could be , i have probably missed that . , that is l almost the last minute thing", "project manager : we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top . so i am not too concerned a that we have not gone into depth about that . but it might be something you could consider when you are thinking about shapes ?

manager : alright , . so we will start off with a quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we have set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on a small joystick , l_c_d _ and a couple of other buttons for navigation with power being i suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we will be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . that sums up the last one . so we will just crack on , like to maybe start with the industrial designer if it is possible . the con today is the concep today .", "project manager : this meeting is the conceptual design phase and is about this . and is to cover things like what the parts might be made of , can we outsource these from elsewhere , will we have to construct any items ourselves ?", "project manager : i will just i will load it up then . which one do y interface concept ?", "industrial designer : alright . the case le that is what i wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic . but later on we found out that it can be rubber as , or titanium or even wood . so we decide what it is gonna be . probably plastic . we need the infra - red transmitter . get that off the shelf . joystick we will probably if we are gonna use it , could be plastic w or rubber even as . if you go on to the next slide . if you go on to f findings , it is like two or three slides down . so , this is what i found we can use . three different types of batteries . can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , that they use in watches , or else a solar powered one .", "project manager : now , the kinetic one , we have that is the ones where like you the movement causes it .", "project manager : the bat the battery for a watch would not require a lot of power , would be my one query . is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ?", "industrial designer : i do not think it would . and solar cells , about that . we should probably just use conventional batteries . , just like in usual remote controls .", "project manager : which i suppose as would allow us to go off the shelf again , you would say ?", "industrial designer : . and these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have . one is a flat one , and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved . the materials are tha there as you can see , but you ca not have a titanium one for a double curved ,", "industrial designer : they make mountain bikes out of that , do not they . so it is really light as .", "project manager : curious . , i if you would be able to off the top of your head or not , the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ?", "project manager : could you maybe draw something ? i you do not does not have to be perfect , it is just i am not quite if i understand the difference between the two .", "industrial designer : for a curved , i was thinking to f for to sit in your the palm of your hand . maybe like this , with the joy pad here . joystick here . and maybe an button around here , so that the thumb can use it quite easily . i do not exactly double curved . it probably means this is probably double curved . whereas a single curved would be like that . or not necessarily .", "industrial designer : like that . whereas this is two curves . so i that is what they mean by double curve .", "industrial designer : which it looks better than the single curve , but you ca not have it in titanium , which is a material . and for the buttons , it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com p_c_s . but it requires a more expensive chip to use , and if you wanna use l_c_d _ it is even more expensive . you have to decide , there is trade - offs there . if you want the buttons to be if you have a double curve control and it is rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as . but you are gonna ha i reckon you are gonna have to have key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days . you would not want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want . you wanna enter just the number of it , if it . i reckon we are gonna have to have a number keypad anyway .", "project manager : that was definitely something we can talk about . you have got a little bit about the chip that we might require as ?", "industrial designer : so , depends where gonna spend the money if you want the f fancy l_c_d _ display .", "project manager : do you have any idea so far , like when we are saying that we would need an advanced chip for an l_c_d _ , does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ?", "project manager : if you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infra - red , whereas if we are controlling the l_c_d _ we definitely require a much more powerful chip . just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons is the point being made .", "marketing executive : if we only have twelve pounds fifty , twelve euros , not even twelve pounds . twelve euros , what is that , like eight pounds like that , nine pounds ?", "project manager : we would also be relying on the bulk buying in producement and such .", "industrial designer : the previous slides just explain what is in the internal components of the remote control . if you go to the one before that so it just says what it does , translate the key press into an infra - red signal and this is received by the t_v _ . the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then it will send it to the tr the amplifier . and then the next slide just shows how the copper wires interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , to get sent to the chip . that is just how the control works inside . we have to decide on what buttons we are gonna use .", "project manager : in the information that you have been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an l_c_d _ looks ?", "industrial designer : we can do it if we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic . and then maybe use single curved case . because we might need it to be curved for the thumb to use the joyst joystick easily . and then you will need the advanced chip for the l_c_d _ .", "project manager : that sounds like quite a good requirement to me . conventional battery would seem to make sense .", "project manager : i am not if there is any cost differences between single and double curved and i am i about anybody else , but plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward ?", "user interface designer : i am actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber for reasons i will go into in more detail .", "user interface designer : now i am gonna have to work between the slides and the white board i actually i have some fairly concrete things this time . i was given a an h_t_m_l _ file giving various ideas from other previous remote control designs , and decided to just dump them all . i was not very impressed by them and they did not seem to re nothing i saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we are going for today . so what i ra rather than looking at other remotes , ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand . and try and f and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we have already decided on , so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already . next slide , if you . and what we have decided on was the joy the joystick , two function buttons and the l_c_d _ , just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum . i do not actually think we need the numeric keypad because if you m because one of the menus that we could have available v via the l_c_d _ is one where you scroll through channels , so if there is something f and be bear in mind since this is not meant to work for", "user interface designer : you are looking at four or five terrestrial channels , and then your v_c _ and then the channel through your v_c_r _ and or d_v_d _ player . so it is not i am not really excessively concerned about that . you must have two modes , basic mode , where the joystick is left right for channels , up down for volume , and the menu mode for further functions . now the reason i was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we are going to have a highly ergonomic design , it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people . , so you", "project manager : can jump in slightly there ? that would suggest the double curved design is probably going to be most appropriate , then .", "user interface designer : yes , . , basi what i what the what be having , i would say , the whole thing articulated at two points , so that if you are handing it from a lef left or right handed user you can adjust it so that the l_c _ the l_c_d _ and the the joystick would be in the right place . and also this is a rather nicer de design gimmick that the whole thing it should have organic feel to it that it should be , soft to touch and can be moved around all . on to the next slide .", "project manager : . just to let we will probably be quite tight for time as , because you have probably got a lot you would like to say , i .", "user interface designer : add pretty pictures to this . the assuming the hand to be in about this position , hol holding the remote , the joystick unit should rest over the joint of the f of the four finger so that it is directly accessible for the thumb . and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for left or right handed users . you then have a grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness . you just have big two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can in the upper part , one for the four finger , one for the middle finger . , and that", "user interface designer : th this part here is the joystick . this would be the actual grip . probably where you would want to have the battery as . that would be probably the bulkiest part . and you then have , at the bottom , the l_c_d _ , and this would need to be articulated as . and i would want this to rest here , right at the base of the wrist . so it would fit just nicely in the hand . , this part could be rotated , so it can so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user . so the t the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button . and then the bottom function buttons switches between modes . now programming it actually thi this is one thing i have found with the replacement remote control . programming them can be a right pain . so th the simplest way around that would be to have a cable to connect it to the computer some fair iv fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer just so that you could pr program it at a rather in a rather more comfortable interface . and you could download programs for it from for t_v_s from all main manufacturers . though you i it would be necessary to have a m have a ha have a mode for programming it without the computer , just in case there are still people left out there who do not have them yet . that is that is my idea .", "marketing executive : so to gather my research , two basic methods . we compared whether people want the remote control to do a lot of or they want it to look . and then we research fashion trends in europe , what is the new black , as it goes . we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look more than they want it to be . as in they want it to do a lot of good s they want it to look like it does a lot , and if it does do a lot that is a bonus , but they do not care so much , they want it to be that is sounds a bit like a contradiction . technology technical technologically innovative . people want it to be that , but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . like the interface is really important . and easy to use , it just so happens that from the second point to the third point is twice as important the second point is twice as important as the third point . people want it i is it has to be cooler than easy to use , if it has the newest features , even if it is difficult to use , prefer it to have the newest features . and if it is easy to use that is a bonus . the fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , but fruit and veg is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes . how that relates to a remote control i . but i see i come on to that in the next slide . i have als i have been saying everything is the new black . spongy is the new black as . we have the choice between rubber and plastic . if it is the type of rubber that you can squeeze , it is spongy , then can i skip the rest ?", "industrial designer : i forgot to mention that . the rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber .", "marketing executive : kinda spongy material . so so my personal opinion ? we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , . but what we need is something that looks like it is from the future that looks , that is different , that is everyone has a white remote control , black remote control , you need something . like , titanium is but it is expensive . and maybe it is a bit of overkill for a remote control . now the fruit and veg options , either we go in that direction or we stay away from it . the research did come up with fruit and veg , so maybe it is important for it is the up to the interface guy . if we stay away from it , s stay away from it , but if we are gonna go along with it then it does not necessarily have to be like an apple like that , or a kiwi fruit . it could be something like , i say potato peeler but i am you guys have a much cooler idea than i do . few questions about a spongy remote control . i have never seen one before . i have seen plastic remote controls . maybe they were i , back in the day when they first came up with remote controls , they had a reason for it being", "marketing executive : sturdy , . for being strong and sturdy . if we want something strong and sturdy , i say stay with plastic or titanium , but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , it does not matter , it is spongy material , it is not gonna break , how the l_e_d _ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material because it is not gonna be completely squeezable . how do things fit it ? and if we are gonna use spongy , we can say it is long lasting , it is damage resistant and like that , so . so just to summarise , people want that is , that is that looks like it is , and if it is then that is a bonus does not have to be people like fruit and veg . we can either go down that alley or stay away from it . people like spongy material . if we are gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , and how we can further promote that idea . and also , this was this year . so , things change all the time , every year they always talk about this year , this is the new black . next year something else is gonna be the new black and we are stuck with last year is fruit and veg type .", "project manager : i would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year is lead on most people anyway . you always have to bring out new designs , so if we can get next year then that is possibly a good place to start anyway . seems like a lot of the components could be off the shelf , i do not exactly what cost would be incurred . see your point about the number keypad , but i have i would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels . my feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of boxes as having the use of the l_c_d _ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be", "user interface designer : actually if you have got a lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as , becau it is if you are trying to remember what , what number is the discovery channel or whatever . it is just irritating .", "user interface designer : but if you h but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure , then you can sub - group them .", "project manager : what it looks like to me is we will use a large number of standard components , say something like lithium ion battery , the kind that you find in most small hand held devices now . looks like we going for a double curved design . i what cost implications there are in that . , looks like we are decided on some flexible rubber . though i would have to say depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some inner frame .", "user interface designer : i would say definitely , i mean the idea of having it articulated i th there would be two points of articulation . w one below and one above the m the main grip .", "project manager : do you think there is any way we could maybe remove the articulation ? see why it looks appealing , but it could be a weak point in the structure , do you think ? that would be a worry of mine .", "industrial designer : if you are going with the fruit and veg thing , looks like a banana .", "user interface designer : i d i do not thi i do not think that it would be a structural weakness ,", "user interface designer : if you have a firm s sub - structure , you can then incorporate articulation into that . if you then have a outer skin of flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is very much organic , and would look rather co mi rather . my drawing there does not do it justice , it makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a remote control , but .", "project manager : however , one interesting point is , i how serious you were there , but we if we take some of the ideas why do not we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ? it is an certainly a different colour from your average", "marketing executive : the noise for when you lose the banana , f , for when you lose the remote control , it could be like a monkey noise like that , rather than a standard beep . y , you lose the monkey the banana ,", "marketing executive : y you lose the banana , you press a button , and you hear like monkey screams like that to direct you towards the banana .", "user interface designer : i th if it that is something that could perhaps be programmable , though maybe have monkey as default .", "marketing executive : s i was gonna talk about the programmable remote control . now it would be if you had one remote control that could work with all t_v_s , you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television . but why you would need to program it like as a standard feature , i .", "user interface designer : basi the for f for e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that the t_v _ responds to . it is not simply a matter of frequency . usually what is done is you have this big booklet full of different possi you will have all of them programmed in to the remote , and you will have this little booklet of codes you then find your ma find your manufacturer", "user interface designer : and try the different codes that come under that manufacturer is name ' til you find the right one .", "marketing executive : that is because televisions , they do not give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it .", "user interface designer : . that is quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that . but if we had some hook - up to your computer as an option , then if you have got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing .", "project manager : an interesting point is that if the person does not have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the l_c_d _ and then they maybe look up different names of different actual units that have been produced . or we have the remote control just go through them until it is like does this do the correct function , and such .", "marketing executive : is it is it actually a book of names to digits , or is it like a few pages ?", "marketing executive : i was just thinking , if we were to store this information , some type of mapping . this person probably need to use this feature like once , when you first buy the remote control , or whenever they buy a new television ,", "user interface designer : and it is a nuisance very close to the to actually purchasing it , so it is something that you are likely to be thinking about . if you if there is w i if there is one in the shop that is that says it can avoid much of that nuisance , you might be favourably inclined towards it .", "project manager : this just to give us a rough idea of what we are meant to be doing for the next stage . i am pretty that you got that anyway . this is the conceptual one . we have come up we have covered everything we need to here . we have decided on what , decided on standard items for most of rubber and such , we are now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting . i will just start at the top , you have got yourself and the industrial designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage it will be hard not to , . looking from prototyping of some des description using clay . i suppose you will be told a lot more about that as progress . the user interface design , they are it looks they are the idea i have pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there , whereas possibly be more interested in maybe how the l_c_d _ is going to incorporate , do you think ? or do you s perceive that most the design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout ?", "user interface designer : other than ge getting a more aesthetically pleasing form for it , mo most of the layout design decisions are made , i would say . but then again , the menu structure to a considerable extent that is gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate . and one of the things about having an l_c_d _ and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it .", "marketing executive : you see i do not some of these things kinda logically follow the others . how can t product evaluation , does not that come after actually seen a product prototype .", "project manager : we would be no , it would be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with .", "project manager : it would be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out , maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places which i suppose is quite similar . or just hitting the streets and saying this is a new remote control , what do you think of the look of it ?", "project manager : the target audience is anybody under the age of say maybe sixty ludicrous . the reason i am saying that is we are just looking at a replacement remote control , something that is stylish , so maybe you are even just maybe you are narrowing down your target audience simply by saying", "project manager : if they are buying it that often or they are maybe looking to replace something then , they have got a bit of free cash , so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket . maybe even single , just for the reasons of excess cash flow . although at twenty five euros , i do not think we are looking at charging the earth for the device . think that is within the normal bracket . your idea of the u_s_b _ would largely depend on the cost . u_s_b _ is definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there , but it might push the cost of the overall unit up it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system . that one might have to be based on", "project manager : the the idea was that maybe it could connect up for allowing a software interface on the p_c _ for a larger programming", "project manager : due to the fact that we have gone for such a , easy minimal design , normally .", "industrial designer : but did not they just say it is just for t_v _ , or are we gonna", "project manager : programming it to use your t_v _ , you might hook it up to the p_c _ . i am not , but i am thinking maybe that the additional cost of the u_s_b _ might be prohibitive . we unless it would make sense to .", "marketing executive : something that does not you would not have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed , once you turn off the power .", "user interface designer : the other thing it would need to ha it would need to have some on board memory anyway . f for one thing because i do think that the menu system should be although , it is not going to be terribly complicated if it is just controlling one device , the menu system ought to be o ought to be customisable", "user interface designer :  . how how you want say the menu structure for flicking through channels if you have got lots of channels .", "marketing executive : i if it was customisable as in different languages and , that does open it is supposed to be international , right ?", "project manager : and we would better be careful about the time as . we have already had the five minute warning , so . international would make sense . you are gonna look at product evaluation . i am i would better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap . you are gonna look a bit more at the physical make up you say . looks like we are gonna need a maybe a prototype in clay . we will see how that goes .", "user interface designer : are we going to be supplied with the clay is what i want to know . where is the clay ?", "project manager : do we have got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting , would you say ?", "user interface designer : . i th i would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole fruit and veg thing .", "project manager : we seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the r rubber could be quite", "user

try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we are gonna go for something how was it ? the new black , i believe . something that looks good that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , . many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an l_c_d _ display . other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . due to your hard work , we might as let the two designers go first , and show us the prototype .", "user interface designer : and outline our ideas . now do doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is h i is down here for the l_e_d _ . as it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly from the point of view of operating the function buttons and joystick , though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit for ju just a thought . you could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn twisted round , so that the sticky so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other . but as you see with the with holding it in the left hand , the l _ the l_c_d _ is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated if we are going to retain ergonomic design . now i got your note about keeping the cost down .", "user interface designer : though i would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more bio - morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as . as for the as for the single curve , this edge and this edge , like i say it would be to have some curvature to it , but it is not necessary . really the curve that is most needed is the underside so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the edge of the hand like this . and you have the transmitter here and a wee speaker for the fi for the remote control finder . any further comments ?", "industrial designer : it is gonna be bulkier than how it looks , because it is gonna be flat on one side , so the l_c_d _ will be s sticking down like this , wo not it ?", "industrial designer : because of costs . and it is plastic as , so it wo not be as comfortable on the hand .", "user interface designer : with the rubber design it could i it could mould very much to the user is hand . one wee feature if we could still do the rubber , i though of was to have the rubber extend beyond the end of the rigid substructure . so it has a wee tail that you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely .", "marketing executive : evaluation . basic point have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by . then we will it is a seven s seven step kinda evaluation process . so not seven steps , seven scale . after we have finished doing all the ratings for each criteria , we average that and that will give us some type of confidence in our prototype . and the criteria based on real reactions ' kinda goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those i put together from the user requirements phase . if you flip the so , those are the criteria . and perhaps i could have put 'em a bit better , but you notice a few things that we have abandoned , which means that the product will score very badly on some of those points . put it mildly . one , t seven , eight , . , so we have to go through each point . if we imagine it is actually straight , and just give it a score . how would you say the prototype is how have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost . , is the homing thing still the locator , is that still", "project manager : i believe so . so i do not think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost , that would mean doing something about the human element , but i would like to think that we have done something about finding the damn thing once we have .", "user interface designer : . and making it a bright colour helps with the personally i would have gone for purple .", "marketing executive : os on a scale of one to seven , how would you guys rate it for finding it once it is lost ?", "user interface designer : w if it was just the sounder then th something i have found with w with say tr trying to find a cordless phone or a m mobile , you can hear it , but you ca not quite pin it dow pin down where it is .", "industrial

, and then we will come back to the product evaluation if that is alright .", "project manager : so is there anything here that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you have covered ? and then we will come back promptly to this .", "project manager : i is there any of these criteria that need any explaining ? or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others ?", "marketing executive : a few . something i neglected from my initial research is that real reactions has a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion , and clothing fashion . that is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion . so they say we put the fashion in electronics , they really mean it they are very big on fashion , so . that is this bit right here . and this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody ? i it is just the same as saying easy to use interface , so it is kinda condensed into one . and we can come back to it , you said .", "project manager : no and which we will do very shortly . slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . most of it stems from the use of the l_c_d _ which in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure because we required a chip as . the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a l_c_d _ , at which point we have removed a large part of how we were gonna interface , require more buttons , etcetera . or what we did was that we as in i as i was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure . changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the proposed costs and we are just scraping it in , we have got point two of a euro left over there . so we are just managing it really . even then as , there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so i have used what i think is appropriate . with any luck that wo not mean that we have incurred more cost than we can actually afford to . it blows a lot of our really good ideas slightly to one side , the possibility of having a u_s_b _ connection is definitely not viable now .", "project manager : that should still be viable . we have got an advanced chip , we have got the use of the l_c_d _ . so being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility . but what is something we need to decide on is how we are gonna go from here . we do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be . we can bring the excel up sheet up and show you if you wish . i really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some solid design , possibly meaning that the l_c_d _ would not be in this perfect place . it might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person .", "user interface designer :  i suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it circular and have it s so that the pink actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger . so that th", "marketing executive : do you have any data on how much different prints cost ? can you get the entire thing printed with a design ?", "project manager : b da is you mean on the plastic , or ? let is have a look . you now have as much information as i do .", "project manager : as you can see here , the battery really not very little choice in that one . we have gone for one of the cheaper options as . unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we are gonna do what we are needing to . i have said single curved . we really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it . plastic for some reason incurs no cost , which i have had to very much make advantage of , despite the fact that rubber is only got a value of two euros per unit . problem comes here as you can see in the interface . if i have read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a euro here in that it is not per push button . that might make sense , because then a numeric keypad would come in at what , four point five euros , which is an awful lot , so that could be wrong . even if we save point five there , it would just mean that we are most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit , which has had to be put to one side . as you can see , the use of an l_c _ display advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as because it is an integrated scroll wheel push button that was not quite what they had in mind with a joystick .", "marketing executive : why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together ? that is quite significantly expensive .", "project manager : as you can see that is taken up over half of the price . i am very much open to suggestions of where we go , but because we need to shed what was four euros off of the price of for what we really desired , this one comes in under price as you can see , but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design .", "marketing executive : we do not even have speakers here . the like we what about speakers and transmitters and like that ? have we factored that in ?", "marketing executive : transmitter , receiver , speakers . plus the extra device itself that is gonna be on a t_v _ . is that gonna be a button , or", "marketing executive : did they s do we have to use an advanced chip for the l_c_d _ ?", "project manager : so if we are gonna go with the l_c _ display , then that is", "project manager : i believe so , . that would probably not be in keeping with the fashion statement and such ,", "industrial designer : fashion . so the only new thing is the l_c_d _ on the remote now .", "marketing executive : and we could not replace the joystick , right ? because we would need four extra buttons to replace it , up down left and right , and that would be more expensive than a but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward ?", "project manager : it is just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be , that is what i have labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation .", "user interface designer : . if we remove the l_c _ display then there was no point to any of these meetings and we just we could just put our branding on any other remote control .", "project manager : it is a shame . we should possibly have if we could have increased the price we could have manufactured that and we could have got something far closer to what we were hoping to .", "marketing executive : does this does this bear in mind that it is a bit ridiculous that they are gonna charge us what is it , like this much money for three million if we are gonna buy three million components ,", "project manager : again , you will have to argue with the accountants on that one . but for the purposes of this meeting , i am we are gonna have to stick with these figures . so , i would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we are gonna keep the l_c _ display it is about what really separates us , despite the cost it is gonna incur . are people maybe not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case , to keep the l_c_d _ ?", "project manager : it is hard to tell . i would say that you are at least gonna take double curved ,", "project manager : and even then i am not quite if that is incorporating the idea of articulation .", "user interface designer : no , i it d that it need not require it to be double curved .", "user interface designer : it is it is just that the case would come in t would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation .", "marketing executive : could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface ? like we do we have re restrictions on software ?", "user interface designer : and the if you look closer at the prototype here , the

focus on and then look at the functions of the dem remote control itself . so with that it is best if i hand over to you . does anyone have a preference for going first ?", "project manager : so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours . i assume we just pull it out ?", "project manager : just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? once we you do not have to do it now but when once you go back ,", "industrial designer : so n with regard to the working design of this remote control i have identified a few basic components of the remote and se from the design , functional design perspective w i c we can now know wha what exactly the components are and how they work together with each other . so this is the method that i will mostly be following in my role . the identification of the components , and since i am dealing only with the technical aspects , i would need feedback from the marketing person and from the user interface person . we will then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and update and come up with a new design , so it is a cyclical process . , so these were the basic findings from today . the last three bullets have been integrated from the last minute email . quickly jotted them down . so the as i told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it and what are the different processes and how the parts communicate with each other . , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . also the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features makes it more comp complex . and the reason why teletext is outdated because of internet and the availability of internet over television . how however , our remote control would only be dealing with the use for television , in order to keep things simple . also the management wants that our design should be unique it so it should incorporate colour and the slogan that our company has it as its standard . , so he here is a functional overview of the remote control . there is an energy source at the heart which feeds into the chip and the user interface . the user interf interface communicates with the chip , so i will basic go over to the if this is our energy source and this is a cell , it communicates it feeds energy into the chip , which finds out h how to do everything . there is a user interface here . so whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver . the there can be a bulb here to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , make the chip more complicated and bigger , .", "industrial designer : i in my personal preferences i am hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . this would help us to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . and also if we can incorporate the latest features in our chip design , so that our remote control does not become outdated soon and it is compatible with mot most televisions . that is about it . so anything that you would like to know or", "project manager : br that is something to consider , i , if we are using more advanced technology , it might increase the price .", "industrial designer : certainly , . so so tha we definitely need to operate within our constraints , but unfortunately i do not have any data , so identified the functional components for that .", "project manager : that is fine . are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ?", "project manager : yes , shall we pull this up ? that has to come out of there . , those last minute things , they are gonna hit you the worst .", "project manager : there is usually three modes , one where it is only here , one where it is only there , and one where it is both .", "user interface designer : that is fine , that is good . , let is start from the beginning . so i am going to speak about technical functions design just like some first issues that came up . so the method i was adopting at this point , it is not for the whole period of the all the project but it is just at th at this very moment . my method was to look at other remote controls , so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what functionality they used . and then after having got this inspiration and having compared what i found on the web just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what the user might desire as additional functionalities . and , and then just to put the main function of the remote control in words . so the findings were that the main function of the remote control is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . and w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , then the user would like to switch the channel just m changing to the next channel to flip through all of the possible channels , or then the other possibility would be that she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . and and also the volume is very important . i als", "industrial designer : cou could you go back for a second ? switching on off channel , volume , that is great .", "user interface designer : among the findings i found that m most of the curr presently available remote controls also include other functionalities in their design , like operating a v_c_r _ , but they do not seem to be able to deal with d_v_d _ players , but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update actually we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . so my personal preferences would be to keep the whole remote control small just like the physical size . and then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red . then , the must - have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . but then other functionalities could be just there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , brightness and similar functions could be just done through the menu . and , the last question i had about whether we wanted to incorporate n more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . so at the for the time being that is all . if you have questions", "project manager : if that was the directive that came through from management , but if we had a decent case for that we really think it is important to include video and d_v_d _ , i could get back to them and see . it is w it is just whether it is worth arguing about .", "user interface designer : and also it is other question is because there are so many different and there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and d_v_d _ there are the video c_d_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to choose between all these possible things .", "project manager : are there any questions for clarification of maarika before we go on to the next one ?", "industrial designer : so in the u user interface requirements we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . but so at this stage , how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or in we can completely do away with buttons and have some a fancy user interface like that . but is there any thoughts on that ?", "user interface designer : the buttons are still the most easy for the user to use , what other options would you have ? a little screen , but this would be really a lot of learning for the user", "user interface designer : and the user just wants to get a result quickly , not to spend time in like giving several orders . i th i would think the put the buttons , but if you have other proposals .", "industrial designer : the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . so we can probably until t we have more knowledge on that . i if the costs allow , we can have like an l_c_d _ display and with because we do want something fancy and fashionable as .", "project manager : we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here .", "marketing executive : so what i have , wh where i have got my information from is a survey where the usability lab observed remote control use with a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire . so it was all about , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , . what is the most annoying things about remote controls and the possibility of speech recognition and l_c_d _ screens in remote control . not that they actually gave me any answers on the l_c_d _ screens , so i should have taken that bit out , but anyway . what they found is that people do not like how current remote controls are , so , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . eighty percent of users would spend more to get , a looking remote control . current remote controls , they do not match the user behaviour , as you will see on the next slide . what zapping is , but", "marketing executive : right . but you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what is on . , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , so that is going back to what , we were saying earlier about , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , they just make it look ugly . so this is my little graph thing .", "marketing executive : send it to all of you . what it is it is cones , they would be more exciting .", "marketing executive : back . , i am gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing .", "marketing executive : so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that is used most is the channel selection . what you ca not see is volume selection , it is a little bit higher than all the others .", "marketing executive : so what the graph shows is that , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , nobody really uses and so that is the numbers along the top represent their like their importance , so on a scale of one to ten , how important is that and , channel selection and volume selection are essential , and the power , it is not quite so essential , although i do not understand how it could not be , and everything else , , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , they are just not needed , and they are not used . this is the bit that the email messed up for me and that is what i was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing . so , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . that they get lost , that the , they are not intuitive and that they are bad for repetitive strain injury . if you are watching enough t_v _ to get repetitive strain injury from , watching t_v _ , then that is the least of your problems ,", "marketing executive : but , it is up there . , so the r_s_i _ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and , not straining your wrists watching t_v _ . right , this is pink because i was copying and pasting the table , and i did not have time to white it out again .", "marketing executive : but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . so you can see from that , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they are a bit more sceptical about it and they are less willing to try it . so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but i d i do wonder how that would work given that a t_v _ , tends to be people talking and , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching t_v _ . , so these are my personal preferences . so you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , so something that is , a bit . , functional , so it is useful , but minimalist . there is a there is an important thing that , people use when , when you are filling up your home , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , , and you have got all this , and you are just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so we need to aim for both .", "marketing executive : then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and , i was thinking that solar power would be quite because , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . and then like a locator , so , like you have for a mobile phone or not a mobile phone", "marketing executive : i know , it is weird . my flatmate and i were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and i was like i need to get one for everything . so , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something a sound that you do not often hear on the t_v _ , you do not want your remote control beeping every five minutes , you would then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window .", "project manager : i am just gonna tick yes . so , we have got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss", "industrial designer : one of the very interesting things that came up in ka kate cat is presentation was this issue of like voice recognition being more popular with younger people .", "industrial designer : so if we need to have a target group then as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and , good looking we are better off targeting a younger audience then , people who are comparatively elderly .", "marketing executive : that is that it did not say in the survey , whether , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , but i am assuming , yes .", "industrial designer : bu but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , so if you want to put in something stylish , then th it will certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people ,", "project manager : then again i the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket", "project manager : i would have thought it is more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they have got their first job and they want their toys and", "industrial designer : but still , if you can go back to that slide and , how popular was it ?", "industrial designer : that is alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh people between twenty five to thirty five , how popular was", "marketing executive : i kn i you are saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , but it has been proven that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they do not have like , if you are at university , you are paying your rent ,", "marketing executive : but you do not have a mortgage , you do not have a life insurance policy , you do not normally have a car ,", "marketing executive : so that just costs more than a car , but . so like it is an age group to target , really , .", "project manager : and if we are talking twenty five euros as a price , that is not unaffordable , even for young people .", "user interface designer : this is not unaffordable , but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a t_v _ to use its full", "marketing executive : i d i many people without a t_v _ . we did not have a t_v _ last year ,", "user interface designer : and the remote control might not it might not even function with the old t_v _ .", "industrial designer : bu but even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it is quite popular , right ?", "marketing executive : the fact that , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , i would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . , so that and the disposable income and i do not think it is something to ignore , .", "user interface designer : but at the same time maybe we can just decide to have both of these groups as our target , because actually they are all still re young people .", "project manager : if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition . is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs ?", "industrial designer : i was having a general outlook on m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself i am not very about , because one of the p things that cat pointed out was how do we go about implementing it ?", "marketing executive : you do have it in your mobile phone though , do not you ? because you have like every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them .", "industrial designer : but how frequently do we use it anyway and h ho how good is it , voice recognition softwares are still quite", "project manager : with but with a t_v _ remote it is gonna be quite limited if we are t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five ,", "marketing executive : y you would maybe need a code word . so like when you say change , except that is being said quite a lot on t_v _ , so maybe like , remote . how often do people say remote on t_v _ ? although i only watch charmed , so really i would not know but like so you would just say remote five , remote ten , remote one two nine .", "project manager : but maybe if you wanna look into that just to check . , so if we go for the fifteen to thirty five age group and then we are going to get th anyone who is older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money ,", "user interface designer : w now the v the voice recognition if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons and , it is safer , so we need both ,", "user interface designer : so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it would not really reduce the size of the remote .", "industrial designer : what wh what i was thinking is that there is this separation between what the channels are on t_v _ and how they are numbered on the remote control . if we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular in the sense that a person can say , i want to watch i_t_v _ one instead of saying that i want to go onto channel number forty five .", "marketing executive : but then the code word would be even more important , because sky advertise on every channel , do not they , so then it would be you would be watching charmed , and then the sky advert would come on and it would change to sky .", "user interface designer : but m but on the other hand , remote control is not as close to you probably might just speak into it and the t_v _ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there .", "marketing executive : do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ?", "marketing executive : so you have to have the remote control . it is more like if you lost it and it is down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it will just change it , you can look for it later , .", "user interface designer : but then the remote control the idea is it is not that it is sitting there on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you would not need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself .", "industrial designer : and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you are saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being cl it will .", "user interface designer : no , but i was just defending the fact why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and not to yell at it from the distance .", "industrial designer : so wh another thing that can be used is that there can be a beeper button on the t_v _ , so you can go and press that button and the remote control , wherever it is , it will beep , so we can probably come to know where it is .", "project manager : that is but then if you are buying the remote separately , but y you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the t_v _ ,", "project manager : some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the t_v _ .", "marketing executive : it is quite important that you do not lose the bit to locate the remote control .", "project manager : . , we are gonna have to wrap this up . but if we go away with that general specification in mind that we are looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it is easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option", "project manager : but that needs a little bit more working out as to whether it is really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning . what we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some summarisation , which y you will get immediately by email . send me your presentations so that use them to make the minutes , and then we have got a lunch break and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . i will put the minutes in that project documents folder , but i will send you an email when i do it , so that .", "project manager : it should be on your desktop , so on the so i will put it i will put them there as soon as i have written them .", "project manager : no , they are all called something slightly different . technical requirements and something , .", "project manager : so , if you put them in there , we will all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to . as to where we are going from here , you are going to look at the components concept . whatever that means .", "project manager : on something conceptual and you are watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognitionwill fall off the map that we will keep our options op ?", "industrial designer : wha what was it again that i was supposed to look into ? con components , .", "user interface designer : but the next meeting are we going to have it right after lunch or shall we prepare our", "project manager : so that is fine , w

if you open it , you have a circuit board here , right , and this is the chip that i was talking about last time . this sends information to a tr transistor here , which then sends the information to an l_e_d _ device here . if you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here , everything else is , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . so you see a particular button attaches to a particular place on the p_c_b _ and on pressing this button i a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes out through there . so the important point that i read over the website was that the configurations of these printed circuit boards are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to , so w we can have a configuration irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have . so that is the important point here , so these are the different options that we have . so the batteries , i will start with the battery , right ? so they can be simple which is like the normal batteries in our the cells , ? thes these are the kind different batteries that the company makes , right ?", "industrial designer : so i if even if you want to consider this , but these are the different things that the company makes , so th they will since they will come internally from the company , they will be eas cheaper , all these options . so the third one is the kinetic energy ones .", "marketing executive : you could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching t_v _ .", "marketing executive : and stop worrying about the whole r_s_i _ from the remote thing , that is just", "industrial designer : the the kinetic energy one is that e they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking . but i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it will just lie there for a long while sometimes .", "industrial designer : but as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it re recharges .", "industrial designer : and the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also made by the company .", "industrial designer : environment friendly . so i will list things and then we can come back and discuss what we think from everybody is perspective . there are different cases that can be provided . they can be the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with one - sided curved and one side flat , and they can be curved with on both the sides . these are the three options , right ?", "industrial designer : would it be flat on both the sides , would be curved from one side , or whatever", "user interface designer :  .", "industrial designer : there were different supplements available , like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ?", "industrial designer : really ? the so we can use even a certain titanium is also used in the company to make some space design equipment , so it is it will be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but it can not be used on a double curved surface . if we choose this , we can not use titanium . for for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic . the interface options now . so we can have push - buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push - buttons . we can have scroll wheels like the ones on mouse pointers", "industrial designer : something like that . so , and they have they can even have an integrated push - button inside the scrolling thing . the scroll plus push . so this is something that has been recently developed by the company , in the last decade , so not too recent . and l_c_d_s , we can have l_c_d_s . so these two are recent and this is q quite old . the various electronic options are so th this concerns firs first of all the chips i showed you at so there is a chip behind this one , right ? the p_c_b _ is inexpensive , so we can put in whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one or a regular or advanced . and the price goes up as we go down , . , so the good thing about wh why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that l_c_d_s can only come with the advanced chip . we need regular or advanced for scroll wheels . and the chip includes the infra infrared sender . besides this in electr under electronics also the company has started making a sample sender , which is did not explained what i what it was , but i am guessing that so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker . so i am guessing that the sample speaker is probably something like , as soon as you press a button , it give gives you feedback , one five or whatever . whether sample sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway . so , these are the different options that we have . th that is now that we can integrate , the user interface and the marketing things in that , keep taking out things from this and underlining things that are important , .", "project manager : you can sit down , but just we might need you to leap up . what are you , powerpoint , or", "project manager : do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ?

opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another then we are gonna start talk a little bit about tool training . essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we have not tried out yet , the whiteboard . we have got a general plan for the project how we are gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . i game in real life i want to i am just gonna you got you can discuss that , i am thinking about proposing that since we have got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just do not ask , do not tell . if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , y is", "project manager : obvi if you guys if at the same time if you like logically if something does not like if i am like we are gonna sell a remote control that is the size of this paper book you say like that does not seem like such a good idea because of x _ go with it . we will discuss it but i am not gonna ask do that or it seems like", "project manager : so , we are what we are role playing is y g you are gonna tap into your own knowledge as . and that is the same for your when we do introductions and you talk about your background have fun , maybe you went to maybe i you are like in maine you went to u_c_s_b _ but you wanna say you went to harvard like that , why not , you can this is i we can have a little bit of fun with it . so are you guys with that does that seem logical ?", "project manager : but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model if you guys had time to check the in real life if you guys checked the corporate website . we have got to make something as fashionable as possible , that is the corporate strategy is we are gonna try to take ordinary that nobody really thinks about and try to make it like john lewis or if you go to debenham is . we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly slick sleek way . way we are gonna go about doing that is at first we are gonna start on the basics . and that is where i am gonna need you guys the user interface designers and the other designer that i ca not remember , the i_d _ and the u_i_d _ right the industrial designer hey right on alright , getting into it", "project manager : to guide me and guide us on this project you are gonna be you are g you guys are the bottom you are like no you ca not do that you ca not have x _ and y _ at the same time . and then we will work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you guys probably got the same emails i did but the idea of , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it is also better if it is not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , like that . and so we will work up from there and then we will meet on and talk about it and then finally we will incorporate as the last stage where you guys build or tell me tell us what is possible and then you tell us what we can hope for and what way to go take the basics and make it nicer and then ov the u_i_d _ and the i_d _ you can keep on the at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible to try t of sync it all up . so that is the detailed design . so it is a three stage thing . right so for now just for th the white board just to get used to it , i have not tried it yet either i am just gonna start and carry like five

will discuss it later it is television only we will be able to change our we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . so i am gonna turn over to the industrial designer to go ahead and make a presentation on", "project manager : might have to hit function f _ eight but it looks like it is gonna come up .", "industrial designer : so the method . we are gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res successfully complete this project . remote control works as follows . this is all pretty basic you guys . sends message to another system , so there is an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there is an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . a user interface controls the chip , that is the casing and the buttons and accordingly the messages as . my findings , did a preliminary study here and i found that too much metal in remote design could potentially interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . and too much metal can remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there is also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that would be really bad . therefore i suggest primarily plastic construction . just some ideas that i had , energy source , it is kinda hip to be eco friendly so maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . the user interface , i was since we ca not use metal i was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic . the chip , silicon based chip i do not really see any way around that , we ca not really be different in that respect . , the sender i am thinking infrared it is the industry standard , multi channel , that is a word i made up , i do not really it means .", "industrial designer : pal and n_t_s_c _ compatible and probably a two hundred foot range . and the receiver is any number of electronic devices . but in this case it will only be t_v_s . personal preferences , i really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , the company simply ca not afford this kinds of lawsuits", "industrial designer : which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value ,", "project manager : is is there a way that we can use modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics", "project manager : that maybe do have some aesthetic value like if a white if we talk about like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a pretty ,", "project manager : you can do i is there some colo der quality plastic that we can work with ?", "industrial designer : that should not be a problem . the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that is perfectly possible for us to do .", "project manager : great . very much nathan . if next we can have the user interface developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that would be great as . s plug yourself in here . hit function f _ eight real quickly , hold down", "user interface designer : so . here we have a my technical functions design presentation . so a few of the requirements we need here . we n need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal and possibly operate several different types of devices although we now find that that is no problem .", "user interface designer : so some of my findings . wanna send messages to a television set . that would be any number of different things such as switch on the television , switch to the next channel , that thing , we are all quite intelligent and a normal remote control does . now some of the other things i found is a complicated remote control that we ca not quite see my red there very", "user interface designer : but this remote control has many functions so it can do a lot of things but it is quite complicated", "user interface designer : and most users will find it find that they wo not use most of the functions because they how to use them and do not wanna take the time to learn how to do it . as you also notice it is quite a boring design . another remote control , slightly different , it is a simpler remote control many less buttons but has many fewer functions , m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . it also has a bit of a cheap look and it is also quite boring . so my personal preferences . revolutionise the idea of a remote control . so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display for the user to work with . and i was gonna add another slide here but i did not quite have time there . just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like having multiple face but it is .", "marketing executive : or not . so this is me . i was looking through some marketing reports that we have got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use t_v _ remotes and see what it is that they are using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they do not about their general t_v _ remote control practices . through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody is used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that is all that is going on , the other functions happen , for some people they are important , but the primary uses are really basic . and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public is use , they are not using a lot of it , they do not need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they what to do with . and we also found out that fifty percent of our people , their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . and then they ca not find it in the room . so what we were talking about with a pager , will really come into play with a lot of these people . there is also a survey about what they liked about remotes , and they all think they are hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . i if that is something we are ready to look into technically , that is up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic is the one that is gonna keep growing , so if that is the direction we are headed in it is something to think about . but it really is the primary functions and getting it to look , which are the standards . so it is a good start for us .", "project manager : i will finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase . right so we have covered most of these important questions through this through you guys is presentations we have got y the industrial designer suggests or emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . sarah , she is recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control ,", "project manager : so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is we have got w if we are gonna go for a sleek look we are putting the fashion in electronics .", "project manager : yes . so maybe this we should look into this younger demographic . so we need to wonder h about how we make it better and smaller and faster think we are constrained to plastics very , we have got this idea , ron was saying we need to think about revolutionising the way it is looking , which might be easier given that we are going for simpler function and that we are only going for a telly . how th this voice operation thing is a good idea assuming that it is doable , at least for the basic controls , maybe we can balance it that way , we can see . you ca not say record alias tonight at seven p_m _ but we might be able to say volume up .", "project manager : the difficulty wh would be in like i you could not speak into the remote that you are trying to find . you have something that picks up a voice from far away", "project manager : if it is hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee thing that is just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too .", "user interface designer : a little sticky pad to stick on top of your television . and you just say something to into that and it finds your", "project manager : or an isolated magnet like , that would not interfere i that would be the technical thing but i like that , the voice recognition for the paging system .", "user interface designer : the other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and put the more complicated things into a voice control . so it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market .", "user interface designer : and the younger market could use the voi voice control method and the older market might k", "user interface designer : exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not .", "marketing executive : go ahead . the if we are gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that is an option technically right now to that ?", "user interface designer : is definitely an option technically . i have looked into costs of touch screen methods and what not , they seem to be almost as cheap as a button method at this point .", "marketing executive : we are doing . it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these four or five basic functions , you can have menu options to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things that you are not gonna use every day and that a lot of people are not gonna use but it is an option there for this hi - tech market that re is the sleek thing we are going for .", "industrial designer : got ta wonder though , if we are adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty euro goal for selling these things .", "industrial designer : it seems like , we are not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip . the microchip is probably the most expensive part of the whole mechanism . so it is just something to consider .", "project manager : i we will cross that bridge in a la slightly later stages of development but i know , that is perfectly viable question . i am seeing that we are gonna just focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but we will make a sleek simple functioned remote control .", "project manager : this voice recognition thing is a we have got a market for it i do not think there is too many , we would more or less be cornering the market on it as , we do not have many . i appear to have lost my microphone . right we do not have many people or there is not very many competitors out there that do that i we have c we have touched on most of this . the idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates . the thing with i see would there not be a we would have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ?", "user interface designer : i am not that is sincerely correct , if you take the example of a mobile phone that trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable .", "industrial designer : back to the cost the material . we have to ask whether we are going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? that is something i w for say we are including three or four face plates , it is gonna drive the cost up . and the other question is , if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market ? we have not done any tests on face plates and whether see if there if there is even interest out there .", "industrial designer : off the top of my head it sounds like a gimmick that would not really go anywhere .", "project manager : it is not like with cell phones like where you have a nokia model x _ and then ten people make face plates for it , we would be just our model of pho of t remote control .", "marketing executive : in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around , it is emblematic whereas you are just sit at home , so unless somebody comes over to watch t_v _", "user interface designer : hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house", "project manager : alright we can discuss that one further when we think about whether th when we do costs and , . true , if plastic is dead cheap and if we are making the whole thing out of plastic anyway we will cross that bridge later but we will have to evaluate what is most important . we have had a bit of discussion already on this thing , n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ?", "user interface designer : have we confirmed that we are gonna go ahead with a touch screen interface ?", "project manager : that would be best . let is based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let is go for a plastic built or b plastic cased tha that is easy on the cost , try to look for some high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and that is a great idea . with a touch screen for the basic functions . and we will tha let is provisionally let is go for a touch screen one with several submenus for possible extra that one put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . do we have a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls . yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost .", "project manager : i do not think i ca not see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we would have to see some new battery technology . let is go with a touch screen with some cutting edge battery technology", "project manager : hey it is worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a presented plastic simple", "project manager : you can put the we could i suppose we could put the basics on the centre easiest people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the other bits and bobs go through menu w we will do the aesthetics . we will touch screen and the battery , focus on presentation . it is th with this voice recognition option as just as for the simple functions the on off , channels , volume , and a small paging function . even if you ca not do voice recognition for the paging just some simple button that is just a i another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some paging . right so any comments ? thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this .", "industrial designer : since we are doing touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the actual interface part of it and things like that ? or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody .", "industrial designer : what what would be on that touch screen ? you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and", "project manager : w it is my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you would need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control .", "project manager : good idea but that one m might just be and they just that one might just be out of the range for this particular", "project manager : a p_d_a _ would they would makes a lot of sense for a p_d_a _ you are gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway what do you guys think ?", "industrial designer : think we just need to come up with a black and red interface on the touch screen .", "user interface designer : . i am in agreement with that , i am wondering how we are gonna get we put fashion into electronics onto this device .", "marketing executive : but if we are gonna use a touch screen where it is gonna come on like on your cell phone it will have your carrier provider name come up first like while it is loading and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary comes on every time you turn it on and then that is it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back .", "project manager : i know i d it seems like it would suffice to have just the r_r _ on there .", "industrial designer : people are not gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on .", "project manager : fair enough . and that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . but then again who wants to turn on a remote control . if i", "project manager : i like that i like the idea of putting the logo in the boot up screen , . any last things before we break ?", "project manager : i am gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . i am gonna save a

meeting we should take decision on that point . so i hope that your respective pr presentations will help us . so each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform who starts ?", "project

of the users . so the current investigation th the current the n current trends ?", "marketing executive : what i found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . after they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most what they find more interesting , more or more important it is a fancy look and feel instead of the current trend which was f the functional look and feel . so now more aspect , ma more a cooler aspect rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to watch , to see . also in euro in paris and milan the current trend of clothes , furniture and all this fashion it is fruit and the theme

did not miss and i saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes .", "user interface designer : they are so they are not like dressed as a carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on , .", "user interface designer : so we are not gonna have a remote control in the shape of a banana ,", "industrial designer : but what is your suggestion how we can

not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend will be different .", "user interface designer : but , i am not really if that would really appeal to everyone though , maybe just to fashion gurus , like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , but i about how ergonomic a , an orange is .", "marketing executive : ma maybe we should

though and to hold , you do not wanna pear or a watermelon .", "marketing executive : don do not you think we can find the shape of a fruit which is handy to use ?", "user interface designer : so , but you also have to you have to also have , fit r all the buttons and .", "user interface designer : it is , it you have t normally with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to a circuit

buttons .", "project manager : i will give the floor . so you are user interface guy . so you are three ? and it is this one .", "user interface designer : . so i received an email around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit , which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control .", "user interface designer : it has a microphone , has a speaker , it is got a little chip and it allows you t", "industrial designer : actually i am not reading microphone there , so that is why you can all have conversation , it just to speak to you .", "user interface designer : it is a sample sensor sample speaker . sample sensor sample speaker . it means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that .", "user interface designer : but there is no understanding of the phrase . so , , i you could build that in , you could link the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on the remote control . but , we have this technology available", "user interface designer : in - house . so , but there is still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components , so it but it means we c we can consider this from a theoretical or usability viewpoint without worrying too much about how to develop it because we have this already done . whilst , some people might get annoyed if we just dump it ,", "project manager : i there is something that i unclear really understanding . is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords ?", "user interface designer : it is it is no , it is it will recognize i keywords , but keywords in a certain order like a phrase . you train it for a certain , for a certain phrase , you say the example they said that they have up and running with their prototype is they have actually integrated into the coffee machine that we are producing is , you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it will playback good morning , how would you like your coffee ?", "user interface designer : so actually that was a bad example , it does not actually ask how do you want your coffee because it ca not really understand the response , so .", "user interface designer : only , like , only in the sense that it can recognize a set target word an", "user interface designer : it is designed it is designed as a fun thing , but i you could use it as a way to implement", "project manager : it is a easy a fancy thing that you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any", "project manager : comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view .", "user interface designer : that is the thing , if you can but you have to pro though it is a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination , you have to s tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen , that whole thing , not just the word channel and the word fifteen , it does not have that logic in it .", "project manager : so this is so this is much more than tak taking this technology , bringing it to the remote control and using it .", "project manager : so this is out of discussion . so if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control", "user interface designer : i do not think it is worth it though , it does not really add much to the functional design and it is not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine , so , . so if we can just move on to the next slide , i have just done a quick mock - up of some of the features of our potential funky - looking remote control", "user interface designer : you see , i was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus , so at the moment it is more of a box focus .", "user interface designer : this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that is designed to be square so that it packs tighter in the boxes . but , i have just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , the scroll wheel is a fairly key part of ,", "user interface designer : everyone has that it is that it could be quite a useful thing , so .", "user interface designer : but it is important , to have two scroll wheels because , you want one for the channel , but you also want one for the volume , because it is the volume i it is , it is very handy for it to have instant feedback and response , so . i have also included this turbo button because , every design should have a turbo button ,", "user interface designer : so this is , a unique problem with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the tuner on the t_v _ is not gonna be able to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , so , the th the person might want to have a might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what is on them , in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , displays that station . or they might want to scroll and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they are doing .", "user interface designer : so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if , if i am going if i am scrolling past them and , it is , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel it is really going fast or whatever . so , that is , those are the two important features we need on the remote , but we can discuss about what other buttons we need , . , i it could be , if we wanna have like a very cheap device , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it is gonna be a banana , that is a pretty gimmicky thing that does not have that much functionality , it is just a couple of scroll wheels and a button it is hard to get so many buttons on a banana", "user interface designer : and it is still very it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote , but if they have these scroll wheels , so , what other buttons do we want ? we could have , i you need an on and off switch ,", "user interface designer : but you could o you could turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , it is like a spy flick thing .", "project manager : so i it looks like we are going completely to forget about the l_c_d _ thing .", "user interface designer : but then you have to have a template for every channel , for a hundred channels , you have to be able to recognize", "user interface designer : i f it is probably more than , than our can handle because it is designed for a coffee machine , to say hello in the morning .", "marketing executive : it is not , it is designed for a cof . is it design for a coffee machine ?", "user interface designer : that is its current application , i would presume that it is , they would not design it to handle a hundred things th so .", "user interface designer : made the point , i if that speech recognition is , even if we can do it , it is not really appropriate for television environment .", "user interface designer : but i did have one thing from a previous meeting , you were talking about being able to find the remote control and i was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having , a base station that can control other things as . it might be useful to have some base station , even if it is just you press on a button on it and the remote control starts beeping , this is a way of finding the remote . y in that case maybe the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say i am here", "user interface designer : it is it is speech synthesis and s it is speech , not really speech recognition , but pattern matching ,", "industrial designer : so this is going to be about the component design . so first thing is we need power source for the remote control . so i was of the idea that we can have two power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , they could be chargeable batteries if there is a basis station thing and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it will be pretty innovative kind . then we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it is not broken directly into pieces , there should be some flexibility in t", "industrial designer : so there should we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve . the s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . then controls for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they do not feel that it is an alien thing for them .", "user interface designer : so , just one second , when you say double curve , what do you actually mean ? you reckon you could like draw us a thing on the , on the whiteboard i am not", "industrial designer : double curve is , you have curves on both the sides if i am right . so it is symmetrical thing , whatever it is .", "industrial designer : so , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what we want .", "industrial designer : so there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves . these are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with certain other materials we can not have double curve . so there was there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , but plastic is the most appropriate one , it will bring the cost down", "user interface designer : if you take like , quality wood that is got a grain and you put some , some varnish on .", "user interface designer : it depends , you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break so you do not have to worry too much about the case being broken ,", "user interface designer : it is the inside . but inside you could have you can still have some cushioning that is not visible to the user .", "user interface designer : and you could also , you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as .", "marketing executive : i was thinking that the shape of a banana is not it is not really handy .", "project manager : you think it is really fancy and fun ? you think that young people that are", "user interface designer : but like a banana you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel on top and just roll it back and forth like that ,", "project manager : it is really ergonomic , it is fit in the hand and you have a lot of surface to put the controls . let is move on .", "industrial designer : so push buttons for the traditional users so that they do not feel they are alienated , just and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing . these are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we can go ahead with that . , we can go to the next slide . then there are different chips , one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip . so we can have regular chip for control . pricing is a factor for us , that is why we will go for the regular chip . and regular chip supports speaker support , so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced .", "user interface designer : so is that , when you say speaker support , you mean it just has some output pinned which", "user interface designer : but the speaker is actually attached to the chip in some way , or is just the signal ?", "industrial designer : yes , yes , it is onto the chip , most probably , not hundred per cent about that .", "user interface designer : so are there any issues where we place this chip to make you can actually hear the speaker from the outside of the banana ?", "industrial designer : that will be the volume control which a user shou it should be already pre - defined . it should be whatever will be the case , the chip is always going to be sitting inside .", "user interface designer : but the speaker , if the speaker is actually on the chip , then if it is too far away from the casing , or if the casing is too thick , then you may not hear the speaker .", "industrial designer : so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better . as or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place ,", "user interface designer : so that is something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the speaker close enough to the outside .", "industrial designer : so that so these were the component selection and these things . we can go to the next slide . and these were the findings which i saw with the web , that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , so our t_v _ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like v_c_r _ d_v_d _ players which are usually attached with the t_v _ , because users are like this and they do not want to have one remote control for everything , so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us .", "user interface designer : although , if it depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit , like a different fruit for each device .", "marketing executive : that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits .", "industrial designer : and as i could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really hot thing s and we should have it on the remote .", "industrial designer : so you are having a basis station . your usually your remote sits on that . so you and it is that is why it can have chargeable batteries . now let is say", "industrial designer : it is like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there . so now what user gets additionally he does not have to buy batteries , they are rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he will recover the cost . so you are having the basis station and there is a button , if you press that button wherever the remote it will start beeping so where the remote is .", "user interface designer : that is a pretty handy feature . it is people would find that worth it even if it was not a recharging station , even if they did not have to buy extra batteries , .", "industrial designer : this is basis station is nothing more , just it is a wire which is coming from the main cable and you are having one socket on which the thing sits .", "industrial designer : but all these things are usually in - house so we do not have much problems . so component cost is going to be the least . anyway , we are not using really advanced technology , l_c_d _ has already been ruled out , a_s_r _ has been ruled out . so it is the basic thing but very trendy and very user - friendly .", "user interface designer : i am just wondering actually , , i this whole fruit thing with the banana , it

i hope you are ready for this functional design meeting . so i will take the minutes you three are going to do presentation . we want to know to at the end to know the new project is requirement we need to know the user needs that we want to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and third part i do not remember which is not very good . , how to design this let is go for the three presentations , so first marketing expert .", "marketing executive : so if do that like this ? it is being modified . do you want , open . i hope i saved it . so ,", "marketing executive : so as , you already know me , sammy benjo . i am the expert in marketing and i want to tell you about what people s want and like and dislike in remote controls , and i hope this is going to help you to design it correctly .", "marketing executive : what i suggest is that instead of deciding ourself what could be and what should be a good remote control , let is ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they do not like and what they do with them because they are supposed to be useful . do not forget about that . so we have conducted a survey on the use of remote controls and i would like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . , so what we found was that there are several things that the user do not like in remote controls . first of all , they find it very ugly . current remote controls as they are the same as this one they are not colour , not shape , they are all the same , and they are not l good looking . what is interesting is that it seems that they were people are ready to pay for and look and fancy looking remote control , so we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that . and the other thing is that the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it the current facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . we see that they zap very often so this is a very important functionality that it should be easy for them to zap in one way or another . and most of the buttons on current remote controls are not used , so we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . now people are very frustrated w with their remote controls and they do not even find it it is often lost somewhere in the in your home and nobody knows where it is .", "marketing executive : maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control , where are you ? like something to like t phones . some of the phones have some of this s functionality . phone you can always phone your phone but you ca not phone your remote control .", "marketing executive : but why not ? and because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , they do not even know how to use them , so most of the people say they how to they to use properly their r remote controls . and they are bad for r_s_i _ but i do not remember what is r_s_i _ .", "marketing executive :  . nobody has any idea about that ? i will check with my", "marketing executive : that is for what the biggest frustration of the user what else do i have ?", "marketing executive : s functions that may be used by u the user in the current available remote controls the tables look very to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . people want to have a power button . channel selection is o often used very often used and very relevant . now i remember what is r_s_i _ it is repetitivity stress injury . we have to be careful with that word but anyway i continue my presentation so , channel selection is very important , very often used . volume is not often used but people want to have control on volume and that makes sense . and n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . they are not often used and they are s more or less relevant . it seems that people find teletext relevant , even if i personally never use it but seems that it is average relevant at least , so .", "project manager : i have been told that we do not consider teletext , that it is out of date now because of internet .", "marketing executive : tell you that in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as these two one were had ten .", "marketing executive : but but if you compare with these ones , they scored a one or two . not very relevant , so if there are good reason not to put teletext it is but just know that people find it somehow relevant .", "marketing executive : that is for the main functions and then we can ask ourself what people do not have that may be useful . net next slide . one of the thing the trend that you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you would not have to tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . so we have conducted a survey about whether people would like or not to have this functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . young people , probably because it is a buzz word , find it very relevant . and as the age goes up the relevance goes down . so now it really depends on the targeting wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? if we are targeting young people then it is probably something we have to consider . if we are targeting you very old people this is something they really why they this should be so now", "marketing executive : this is , depends on that . and i do not have any conclusion , i did not have time the meeting was very tight , so that is my findings . and , if you have any question ?", "marketing executive : we should aim at the young people . but they are those who might be more interested in a new device . in general the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than more than", "marketing executive : then teletext is useless for them , because they have other means of finding their information .", "user interface designer : that is but this but number three , yes . so , my name is mark dwight , and i am responsible for user interface design . however , project manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . , as i am a more an artist that is gonna be less technical functions but more user interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this .", "user interface designer : so next slide . and a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task is not to forget about occam razor . we should never complicate things too much . we should only make a remote control , nothing more . nothing more than this , just a remote control . current remote controls they are never easy enough to use .", "user interface designer : so , make a click , . so here is this remote control . it is quite a standard one , but it is not from a t_v _ , it is from a much easier device like air conditioning . but , we can use it for a t_v _ easily . only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options else , and make a click , compared to this one", "marketing executive : i would say the simplest one as long as there are the i find the buttons that i need every time i need a button .", "user interface designer : findings . our question of the style , we should remember that our company puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it .", "user interface designer : be simple . be simple and you will lean on this market . market is a of remote controls it better , it is very it is not an easy field to play , ? for personal preferences that to make a baby - proof remote control it got to be a titanium . it is a really good style , it going to be look like this . it is unbreakable and it is very universal . w we will have a screen with a back light which can change colours , and we can put all the options into this screen . we will need only few buttons . all the other things can be controlled through the screen . and all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . so press i would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium and what else ? i got just very few and good ideas . we need power and volume . and let us include two features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . when you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the t_v _ ,", "user interface designer : when you do not touch the control but you go out of the for for enough time", "user interface designer : and another feature that i would like to implement is volume control . suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . like , you want to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa , and then the volume changes .", "marketing executive : according to your distance to and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system .", "marketing executive : i am not about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? is it a touch screen ?", "user interface designer : it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter .", "user interface designer : which change colours , which makes it easier to find , and each can it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , so that is it .", "project manager : i see that you target several s application not only t_v _ but i like we talk about universal remote control .", "user interface designer : can be easily done , you got simple designs , y we should put it to simple actions . let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi - fi system . you want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume . just few actions , a few actions for everything .", "user interface designer : all the rest , we sh we will put it into this menu on the screen .", "project manager : since we were targeting a really soon date for the i issuing of this remote control we will only concentrate on t_v _ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised .", "marketing executive : if i want to go to directly to channel twenty five , how would i do can i do that with this ?", "marketing executive : let is say i am on channel eight now . these days we have hundreds of channels , that is not so easy to go just next when you have hundreds of channels .", "user interface designer : set up your t_v _ set like channels that you use they are one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel .", "marketing executive : in one remote control that i have seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and sixty four are those that i want to by cycled with my next button .", "industrial designer : but even we can have some l_c_d _ display , like you can de you can just button the number", "marketing executive : one thing is that as i said in my presentation people really do like to z zap .", "marketing executive : so even if they are only watching four or five channels , they want to zap out of the one hundred channels ,", "industrial designer : but otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five", "project manager : maybe we can make different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or", "industrial designer : so we can have more functions for t_v _ if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .", "user interface designer : could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?", "marketing executive : i could have a look at that maybe . i will check in my department if there is someone specialist in that .", "industrial designer : as , i am mister ramaro . i am an expert in industrial design of all electronic devices and i previously devised many like digital calculators and electronic calculators . so now i will briefly describe the working design of our remote control . as the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the device , like t_v _ or v_c_r _ or d_v_d _ player etcetera . so we will have a p portable device which will send message to the main device like t_v _ . so we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . and usually this so to do these functions we need an interface , which some pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack like that . and then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . it is generally in the form of infrared or some s sensor information . then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . so , we need since we are focusing on our interface device remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like the keypad and buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it is mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are i am one doing mostly digital devices we ought to have some processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . and then we will have the infrared l_e_d _ source which sends the information to the main device . then we will have switch in our main device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different t_v_s , so some t_v_s will have different encryption codes for doing s channel changing and these things .", "industrial designer : because the people do not use one particular brand so or at least we have more than five brands , which are really good . so we need to check their specifications and do their encryption that is passing information to the t_v _ device . so we need to have particular encryption codes . then , components , so we have the main energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared source and then we have some inside some chip in the device . since i do not have much time so i will input the connections to all this components . and since i also want to know feedback from our marketing expert and user interface , so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .", "project manager :  . and from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard , or .", "industrial designer : i am , because since our user interface speech recognition and also marketing expert for the speech recognition is really handy , so we can have another , like s simple speech recogniser on our d_s_b _ chip . since we have some energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put the small simple speech recogniser", "industrial designer : no , even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , .", "marketing executive : think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , and ha you can not use my remote control , because it is targeted to me .", "industrial designer : because we have only very few words like power , switch on or some like then we will have something like this we will have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen .", "marketing executive : the user will just be able to say can you pump up the vo pump up the volume or it will be something like volume , up , down .", "industrial designer : ye a user can use any sender but they should have this prompt volume and then", "industrial designer : volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words and because we ca not really say user to say same wording", "industrial designer : then it become more mechanical and . and then we can have channel they can say , i want eight , because we like users have different programmes , they do not really follow same channels strict so we just want channel number , we do not want like b_b_c _ or c_n_n _ else", "industrial designer : because it will be complicated so we will have only these three main basic anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem , it is it will be take care of our main .", "user interface designer : no it is a conceptual question , now i see th this the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up ,", "user interface designer : and he is coming , he is really annoyed with this , down , up , down .", "marketing executive : first of all this is not functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons .", "industrial designer : actually we can have one switch to like switch on , on and off , this processor and this really , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this d_s_p_s . again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use d_s_p _ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and like this key . so it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on t_v _ remote control", "user interface designer : did you consider the r gest gesture recognition ? like , if i want to put volume up i like do i take my remote control do like something like roll 'em up", "industrial designer : even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really they just they do not touch the remote and y you how much time you need to switch on or switch off", "marketing executive : so but sh should we target a user personalised remote control ? so in a given room there might be more than one remote control . we would have each one and with our own personal settings .", "industrial designer : yay . that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say , suppose they are watching a tennis match then they can say after one hour i",

the next meeting , and in this one want to be more focused on the individual actions the on the components you will focus on the component concept the u_i_d _ mark will be focused on the user interface concept", "project manager : and our m market expert sammy benjo on the trend watching . like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal coach . and we have maybe we have to we say , only for t_v _ , not teletext ? automatic on off control it is not possible .", "project manager : implemented . o , we can think about that . and do you see something else ?",

fancy and seven mean no . so it is one or two .", "marketing executive : then we have technology . so , what about technology ? we have we have speech recognition , we have location based ,", "marketing executive : so let is suppose my daughter take it and through it away . do you think it makes sense that it is going to live again ? , maybe not the prototype .", "marketing executive : useful . , so the question is does it have the minimum requirement of re remote control ?", "industrial designer : channel . i this is volume control and channel changes . these are the main", "industrial designer : you , and you can do on l_c_d _ using these going to scrolling all the option .", "marketing executive : so but , because the l_c_d _ is not touch control , touch screen , you can not go to channel twenty five directly .", "user interface designer : so , the basic mode so that is simple . the basic mode is you got just two buttons and a jog dial . with two buttons , you do this like volume up , volume down .", "user interface designer : and if you want to make to s twenty - five , you push on this . you select twenty , you select five .", "marketing executive : it is much longer than that being two five , no ? may not , we can go . that is you are right .", "marketing executive : that is it is less . but it is , because people anyway do not go there .", "industrial designer : we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on l_c_d _ . so", "project manager : because i am not that is for that this one are b d two dir directional button .", "industrial designer : . , see in l_c_d _ , like you will have blocks and you select which one .", "marketing executive : two . so size and weight . is it the effective size and weight that the is it real size , real weight ? or because it", "marketing executive : it is going to be lighter , because this seems to be very heavy f ,", "marketing executive : so , should be . up to three for that , because i am have not seen the weight so i must not colour and shape .", "marketing executive : so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the l_c_d _ . but , it is not very clear what is the colour of the sh the case .", "project manager : and what about the strawberries on the top ? i am not convince . but maybe i am not trendy . but ,", "marketing executive : usefulness is m as i rem just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness . whether it is fancy or not now , it we have to decide . but this", "marketing executive : if it is so , that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead .", "industrial designer : then it is bit difficult to use . not like this d we are just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too .", "industrial designer : so , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , for strawberries and different colours . so it is", "industrial designer : the f so these are rubber things . even if you lose one you can just put whatever .", "user interface designer : moreover , moreover it covers all the end goals . even if it is , it is very rounded , but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it is completely secure to leave it with children and that .", "industrial designer : so we just so even if you do not put , it works . but this is really fancy .", "marketing executive : i suggested three . because , everybody s does not seem to be convince , although it is quite you have good arguments . and the last one is adaptive . this is not r maybe not as important as the other one , but can we adapt it to each personal use ?", "marketing executive : what else can we need ? you do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as ?", "marketing executive : fruit titanium , . , i if this is if you are ready to do that , then it deserves a one .", "marketing executive : two point one seven . two point one seven out of seven . we have a good thing . , that is all i had to say about the evaluation .", "industrial designer : four buttons at least . and then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition .", "marketing executive : is it a scroll wheel and pe push button , th this centre one ?", "industrial designer : then it automatically we can just do like you feel , it goes . and it will activate", "marketing executive : so what is are we supposed to cut things out now ? , until we get twelve fifty .", "marketing executive : if i look at what is the most expensive things , it is the l_c_d _", "user interface designer : as you may know there is some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , producing electricity from mechanical energy . so , that when you take device and push the button , you produce enough energy", "user interface designer : to make electricity . that you do not need a battery . so , it is something like hand dynamo robot . a real high - tech version of it .", "user interface designer : and i propose to so , about chips . advanced chip on print , right ? so , put minus one there , .", "marketing executive : if click somewhere , you will see features . yes , it does . maybe put minus two , so it looks more reasonable . anyway", "marketing executive : no , minus two . nobody will know . it is not recorded , is it ?", "marketing executive : . maximum is maximum . so , remove one of them . , we are on target .", "user interface designer : i . i am not who was programming this calculator , . i wonder if we put a _ or b _ somewhere instead of a number .", "marketing executive : this is right . so finance , that is done . are the cost under twelve ?", "project manager : so , you say , is there sheep ? so luck , but good . which imply good team performance .", "industrial designer : we got new idea , speech recognition , location finding . new materials , new s this fancy strawberry design .", "marketing executive : we are great . there is

the conceptual design , do not ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it is just something important that we need to do . , think of it is turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we will come to some final decisions on what we are gonna do for the prototype . right so , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that i did not make the roles clear enough , so i will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . , fair enough , for the input , is always good . so , all we are gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , and gonna go through you , whoever wants to go first is f fine by me and we will collate what we know about what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . and then we will make some more decisions on basic firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to .", "project manager : take it away . it is nathan right ? i am not calling you the wrong name over and over again ?", "industrial designer : . , what i am gonna have to talk to you about today is component design and it is been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers , so what i am gonna be doing is talking to you about that . , components of a remote control , . we have already gone over this but we are gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . energy source , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . our manufacturer did not say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . , and also there is a kinetic energy possibility . , it is like a the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . so that is one possibility but i whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen . so we will have to look into that . , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . and then as far as the way it is shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably do not wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .", "industrial designer : i imagine that we could specify . , i do not see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres .", "industrial designer : the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we would have to use more chips , and that would cost us more . and if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case we will have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons are not compatible with that . and just a little note there ,", "industrial designer : touch screen equals many chips which equals many euro . , one thing that i noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . so you notice when you push a button on a remote you ca not see anything coming out of it but there is light coming out of the remote and the television can detect that . and if you were to record if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . one thing that might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just as a fun gimmick . so you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .", "industrial designer : course it would have to be a part of the spectrum that would not damage the human eye or anything like that .", "project manager : is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like", "industrial designer : just as a fun gimmick . just to set us apart a little bit . , and then on to the circuit board that we are gonna use , also known as the chip . , we really do not have any way around the t_a _ one eight three five . findings , we are very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?", "marketing executive : i would say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?", "industrial designer : right , that is my concern too . , if we do go the lithium battery route then we will have to go outside our current manufacturer . my personal preference is i will just throw my cards on the table , we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . , i like the idea of the visible light signalling , that is something to set us apart and i was thinking about i was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . so we are not so confined by one style and say some , say our the one if we just go with one and it does not go over then we are in a bad situation .", "project manager : can we do marketing piloting too ? try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they are received ?", "marketing executive : it is an option , but actually there is i have got some research already on like what we are looking at and trends in casing right now", "marketing executive : which actually might even come into play beforehand , it may help us decide for now . temporarily anyway .", "project manager : that is perfect , so i that makes sense for you to take it from here .", "marketing executive : i know , what a teaser ai not it . so current market trends . , i was looking at what is going on in the remote control market right now and what is going on in other design fields , to see what is trendy , what is new , what is happening . , remote control right now everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting they are sick of this boring , normal , functional , that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable thing . now i am not saying we should have , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but it is possible maybe to use natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , v line thing may be something we can look into . different skin options , or if we ca not afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be", "marketing executive : a different shape or , not the example i would choose , but what to t and th the feel of the next couple of years is spongy ,", "marketing executive : not something i have come up with a though if we can get around to getting piloting , maybe a casing option like not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like , leather options or wood options", "industrial designer : i should have mentioned this . as far as the rubber that we can use a rubber as part of the case ,", "marketing executive : might be an interesting way to go . , so something to sit on for now . overall we should stick with what we are finding , everyone is looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now .", "marketing executive : i d but then if the touch screen thing is not gonna work out for us that is really a non - issue .", "industrial designer : i like the idea of rubber too because it is tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it does not matter . so many", "marketing executive : but worth a shot . , it could be , that is what i know .", "user interface designer : phew . computer is adjusting . so interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer . so yur user interface , guys , is aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise perceive . , commands and mechanisms , that user uses to control the operator operating system . here is a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today . we are definitely trying to get away from this a look . , so the following are a bunch of different interface concepts . voice recognition , we actually have some new information from our research design team but i will get to that in a moment . current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , and you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . now our design team , research team , has been able to set up a system in which you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to with standard responses . like you could say good morning remote control and it will say in a sexy female voice , good morning joe . we already have this for a coffee maker line", "user interface designer : another concept is what apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with l_c _ display like on the ipod which i am most of about . and then we have the scroll button with integrated push - button , like a modern a bit bulky , a bit crazy , i do not think that is we are necessarily going for .", "user interface designer : and some special components , ideas like blocking , having the ability to block channels from your for your children and dedicated buttons for commonly used channels and even ideas like secured or hidden programming but i again if we go with touch screen i do not think that is a big issue . and this is the big daddy of remote controls here . the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose .", "user interface designer : again probably not what we are going for so my ideas here and where we are heading is something slightly larger than a regular ipod with a hard cla c plastic casing although some of the suggestions we have come up with are definitely very good ideas . changeable casings our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it", "user interface designer : and get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our bottom line . touch screen interface , possibly having go - to buttons being stuck into the system so those do not move away from the screen , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . , and our voice command system which i have talked a little bit about already and the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features that are around so red for power , arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . and perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh my toastie maker that i got from my bank has jokes when it is ready .", "project manager : great , wonderful ron , . lot of good ideas , good facts to have . that is what they need , it is like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you do not have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom . right so , good to know all that , guys , . now we have to come to some decisions , i figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . based on what nathan presented as far as the various costs and benefits , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ?", "marketing executive : it is our most marketable feature just because it is so new and it is something that is showing up in other places . but can we really afford it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then", "industrial designer : my estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it is gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty euro per remote ,", "marketing executive : and our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ? do we remember ?", "project manager : there is , it is just , it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we are gonna have to increase the price to make money .", "project manager : from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift hundred per cent profit margin that would mean selling it from twenty five . if you multiply seventeen fifty by two that is thirty five . so", "marketing executive : though that is what people would pay for , if you are gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you are gonna expect it to do something", "project manager : and that is to be fair the per cent of the market we are not going for mass any , mass sales anyway , we are gonna make we are not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just could not , not for twenty - five euros , so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that is something that we can have finance deal with . , i say that we provisionally go with the touch screen or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter ron ?", "user interface designer : i am thinking that is definitely a good idea and i also think that we could probably come up with some a cheaper means to go about this production , my team in the on the third floor suggested that", "marketing executive : see if we can cut some corners . and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper .", "industrial designer : it is true . we could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on", "project manager : no we could have a s very simple touch screen , there is always the opportunity , if it is gonna be about the size of the ipod or whatever , w we , i we can play around with it a bit . let is say that so the touch screen will be our main selling point here .", "user interface designer : that we really have two main selling points , that our casing and the voice recognition", "project manager : the voice rec thing , if we are looking at bottom line , now we are looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , we might have to drop the voice rec .", "user interface designer : to be honest , we have the capa we have the design in - house ,", "user interface designer : we have come up with this , with this new voice we are using it for our coffee machines already .", "user interface designer : pass you on that email from my guy in guy down the hall .", "industrial designer : if we do both the production costs are going to go way up but it does put it into it would become the rolls royce of remote controls . it would be very .", "marketing executive : right and they said they wanted voice recognition . course , maybe they had not thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we are not gonna use it even though we know it will sell is a call i do not think give the highs ups . like really i ca not go in and say no we are gonna just ignore everything we know .", "project manager : i ca not see how it would not , there is the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . , you ca not have all three .", "industrial designer : you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function .", "project manager : it is just impossible . if we are gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . otherwise , we just it just becomes cost prohibitive . what which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ?", "marketing executive : we already have research backing voice recognition as fiscally solvent . but i personally would tend to another direction but if that is what is gonna sell that is what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model .", "industrial designer : i would have to side with that , the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the all the technology in - house , it is ready to go , it is packaged , it is", "project manager : what does the cost look like ron ? is it cheaper to do the v_r _ or to do the touch screen ?", "industrial designer : this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but the voice recognition would they are both gonna push the costs up , but , since we already have the technology in - house for the voice recognition we are not gonna have to do as much design work and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if what .", "marketing executive : and we are still not then we do not have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , we can stick with what we have already got . in a lot other ways too .", "project manager : . so i am getting alright so more or less you guys think that o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better .", "marketing executive : it is our lower risk option which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option .", "marketing executive : and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that is you guys is next step right ?", "project manager : we will sic we will sort out what it what f what else we are gonna talk about for the prototype but that is our next step , it will be a developing of prototype .", "industrial designer : are we going to talk now about the materials that we are gonna use for the case and all those things ?", "project manager : yes . we will just run through it , . you discussed either a lithium or a solar power . would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ?", "industrial designer : the solar power definitely would be but just to keep people from getting annoyed , sometimes solar power fails and there is no way round that , we should install a small backup battery . just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote has not been exposed to", "marketing executive : what of people with like the t_v _ in their basement , like what if wha we ca not guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably", "industrial designer : it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , and how those do not really require that much light ,", "industrial designer : but a little more light than a calculator , but we are not talking about a lot of light . does not have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything .", "user interface designer : i am willing to agree with everything that is been said . i have to say though that another idea is come up in my head . if we are really not handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand - held remote control and maybe have a round remote control that looks like a paperweight like that , a sleek little neat thing that sits on your table .", "user interface designer : if you do not need to pick it up it could be a selling point .", "marketing executive : i if it is got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job .", "industrial designer : do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes .", "marketing executive : true , and i probabl we are banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too ,", "project manager : but that is done , that is no bother if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever they might have or like who is it , apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub - woofers like clear and glass and then they got these little pyramidal type of speakers . , why not have a little rounded thing , it could still have the basic buttons on it . , we are going for basic functionality primarily as .", "project manager : and maybe a menu button and , use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever we can sort that out .", "industrial designer : you are on to something because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . maybe something that looks on a table is would be good , even though and hand - held the same time .", "project manager : a although we do wh is i am recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white brushed aluminium thing and get back to it but you could have a very tasteful wood coloured or earth tone", "project manager : still , , along those lines . i like that , i like that idea a lot . , let is see what we can do as far as that goes . and the material like the plastics and , we were discussing that being using like a rubber softer feel , li lik if you feel the tip on this pen it is a bit gives just a bit . something where it is a more advanced f form of plastic that has some a tactile response to it .", "marketing executive : which is the next big thing , so that is not gonna hurt us either .", "project manager : let is see if we can do a squishy non - remote control - looking remote control . but to be fair , , you just c you could just put it literally put it on the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up . i like it , i like the idea , that is good .", "project manager : and we have sorted of discussed costs , . i we will a that is gonna be a thing , if we run a bit over - budget , that might be , .", "industrial designer : about the lack of information on cost , have not been provided that information by our manufacturers", "project manager : we will have more of an idea later on . and we just go from there . , so we have revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , so we are more or less con we wh we are more or less in agreement that we want to have a simple function , not too complex .", "marketing executive : when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although i am not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those should not be", "industrial designer : if , if we are not going the touch - screen route then we can just incorporate maybe something that folds out like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here and something that slides down to reveal the more complicated things .", "marketing executive : and they slide . and do we wanna consider like an ipod screen which is not a touch screen but you are still scrolling through menu options , in p", "project manager : if we are gonna have a non - remote - looking remote , how do we . b but no", "project manager : we could do a slide or a compartment , like if it say it is a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it would be easy to have a compartment in there . or , a b a series of three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on a d_v_d _ player . you see the modern d_v_d _ playerswill just have a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them", "industrial designer : so are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what buttons we are going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? rubber buttons ?", "project manager : it seems like it seems to me that we could just do the stick with the rubber since we are probably gonna be using some rubber for the outside case", "user interface designer : to a certain extent we have to stick with a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command .", "marketing executive : no it is basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody is already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it is not like we are dealing with everybody relearning things that is not something anybody is gonna wanna buy a new for .", "project manager : . we have already covered this as . that seems to be selling and we have more or less that we want to kar target this youth market , . especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population .", "project manager : . alright , more or less covered what we need to cover fi an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype .", "project manager : the i was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth any other final thoughts before we go ahead and ?", "industrial designer : have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ? or are we just going to go with one ? . it is very , it is very hard thing to predict because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit , but if you have just one case and it does not go very . it is a tough situation , but having more cases also costs more", "project manager : then again colours would not be so hard to do , you could have a , a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and , i , olive green .", "project manager : that would not be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing .", "project manager : that is probably a good i d let is work on multiple case colours . but , stick with the same kinda , the same basic non - remote remote design . alright , so we will have the next meeting about half an hour , . i want the i would like nathan , i would like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , given these parameters that we are just gonna have this non - remote . , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . and ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this

remote like shape because you did not really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . that would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold -

forward , stop , pause , enter . and enter would be for like , the menus . and then other menus for d_v _ as t_v _ , whether that means like we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus . and we can decide if that is what we want , if we want to include that on the remote , if that is something that would stay on the t_v _ itself , . these are two examples . and you can see on the left , it is got a lot more buttons , and i if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . and then on the right , it is a lot more simpler , it is got volume , it is got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it is also what is fast - forward is also like next on a menu . so you have functions that are d duplicating .", "user interface designer : and you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . so that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version .", "user interface designer : and then lastly , it is just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? and what functions it needs to complete . , what are needed to complete insulation process , , that is something that also has to be considered and it is gonna be hopefully a one - time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place . so that is it .", "marketing executive : yes , so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls . seventy five percent think they are ugly . eighty percent want they have are willing to spend more , which is good news for us if we make it look fancier , and w we just need something that really there is some other points up there , but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple . so that is really what we need to do . and we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high -

off button , you think . anything else ?", "industrial designer : that is a good idea , because that is one of the most important buttons .", "user interface designer : just , should it be larger buttons in general , like the examples that i had , they were swi quite small . so should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ?", "marketing executive : we should . like that would be in a as in like in for the design , . we should definitely go with buttons that do not look like a normal remote , most remotes have small square buttons , we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles .", "project manager : let is talk about all of our we will come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let is wrap up this one , and i am gonna go back to my powerpoint , we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might have already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . let is go through this . new product requirements . first it is only going to be a t_v _ remote . we are trying not to over -

technically challenged people are gonna use it . they want something user - friendly , so", "industrial designer : even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra , they are saying they only use ten per cent of them , then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons .", "project manager : so we want for our target group would we say , young and old , all age ranges , all , not kids , or kids ?", "marketing executive : no , kids need to know how to use a remote , i would think .", "project manager : what about technic technical specifications , like how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ?", "industrial designer : how 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no .", "project manager : and we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . so we said it needs to send messages to the t_v _ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple like this . so if you have something just say it and we will add it to my meeting minutes .", "project manager : and we wanna keep i will make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . correct , because people only use ten percent . hey , what else ?", "industrial designer : like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ?", "industrial designer : what if we gave it a charger ? and on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it is got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you .", "user interface designer : if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different battery .", "project manager : we can make a decision about that later . we will still put that as a point that we need to discuss . so that would include battery source power source rather . is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? and we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that .", "user interface designer : if we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another more handicapped disabled demo demographic .", "marketing executive : th there is the people who desire speech recognition , there is the different demog demographics have different desires , i if you guys ge", "marketing executive : it would not copy onto the thing it is black , but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . so older people do not really care . it is really the people twenty five to thirty five . i feel those are the people that really watch a lot of t_v _ though .", "project manager : and if and if we introduced it when they are this age , they are going to probably always buy a remote that has", "user interface designer : then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote ,", "user interface designer : then you have already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , whereas if you just speak in general and you do not have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it .", "project manager : and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . if we said , find remote , locate remote , . a certain phrase then it could beep . just throwing it out there .", "user interface designer : do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? can we conceive of leaving them out ?", "user interface designer : like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero .", "project manager : that is true . and also remember that in this day in age we need , like a hundred button , too .", "project manager : i used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . so i could not whenever i got cable , i had to get a new t_v _ .", "project manager : get your own remote , or digital cable . i , we are gonna discuss the project financing later , making that we can fit all of the that we want to on our budget .", "industrial designer : i do not have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so", "project manager : and do not forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo .", "marketing executive : i feel like a ye i feel like a yellow one would be too garish .", "user interface designer : if you have like a hang on . if you have this strip down at the bottom the base of it , just like yellow with the r_r _ .", "project manager : so we have simplified , we do not need all those play , fast -

fashioned telephone like this , where we put the buttons around , like we would put a big on - off button else in the middle , it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , and then put the numbers around in like an old - fashioned dial shape . then it will appeal to older generation and like said retro is . so it is classically retro . so that is just an idea if you guys like it .", "user interface designer : looking at the interface concept , it is gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . if you wanna start the next slide . ca not really see , but there is two possible ways , on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of the remote , you have the scroll down , so you have that option right there . and then also there is the idea of the base . that is like an idea there . and then on the right , we have what is really big trend right now , it is the ipod . it is becoming really and so you have this very simplistic menu section with the round buttons , and it is like you have the both trendy and hip , but also very sleek and very simple , but technologically advanced . so if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of like using that idea in a remote control then look into it , but anyway , next . there is the idea of like being able to do it by feel as by sight . you would you are in the dark , you do not wanna be looking at the remote control . and the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it is a v _ , and so yo you are feeling a v _ like volume up . what it really is a v _ and what it you think it is down , because the down arrow . and so it is like a criticism you would probably turn that o the other way up . but then you have you could either do it by raised type , which could be , iffy , old - fashioned in a way . either that or just have it by shape , you have a specific triangular shape that you are looking at the up and down arrow . and then the round ones you feel by , that is the second one down , that thing . so it is looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel . this is an example of going for a s certain demographic . this is particularly geared towards children .", "user interface designer : it is very cute , and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like a the for the company logo . and you have the shapes and it is very simplistic and friendly looking . and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain channels that only these children would watch , so it is like they ch watch , the c _ beebies like that , keep them away from other channels . so that is like another ar , these are three examples looking at it . you have the wider section for the main controls there . you could see how many buttons there are . and then on the left you have an example of the round buttons , and a simpler design . on the bottom we probably would not need that , because it is more for like a d_v_d _ function which we are not gonna be using . so again it is like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that is where you could put the r_r _ , real reaction . and then finally these are like the same examples , but also some more , just possibilities that we could go with . none of them i am particularly keen on .", "user interface designer : but it is like just taking aspects out of that and saying , out of this one we like , the round section of , b or we would like the button size on this .", "industrial designer : . th that looks like it . so basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , chip senses the connection , chip produces a morse code infra - red signal , specific to that button . so you press the button , it produces a signal that is encoded specifically for that button . transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the t_v _ is centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera . so that being said next slide , . findings which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator , all those basic things that make a circuit function . fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself . an l_e_d _ , which is a light emitting diode , contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power - source , whatever power - source we have actually determined we want . personal preferences , to save money for the components , the remote should be mass - produced and basic materials should be bought en masse . if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , l_e_d _ , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it . just talking to the manufacturing division . they suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power , so you shake it and it increases the power . i am not how the hand dynamo works , they have yet to get back to me on that . so next slide , .", "industrial designer : suggested casing options . we can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double - curved , very specific to the customer . options for materials , plastic , rubber , titanium , wood . i do not think anyone is gonna go for a wood one , because splinters", "industrial designer : certain restrictions do apply here though . latex , you ca not do solar power with a latex one . so , if they want some a soft squishy rubber , they ca not have the solar powered option . double -

we are short on time . welcome everybody . hope your sessions went . so this is our functional design meeting , we are going to consider user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . i have been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and i will be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there is anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . i will get the ones up for next time , they are not finished yet . so can we have updates from everyone from what you have worked on just a quick summary of anything interesting that you would like to share or discuss in this", "marketing executive : is that it ? so what happens it does not work ?", "industrial designer : it is like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press f _ eight .", "marketing executive : we are here . in order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . , the findings in some cases matched what we were talking about . custome customers and users do not like the way remote controls look , they do not like the way they feel , they do not think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there is a study of the buttons that they use most and we should design according to these buttons . easy to lose , and r_s_i _ . i what r_s_i _ means . the person that did the questionnaire did , i do not have a clue .", "marketing executive : according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , i have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . so the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . they are used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . and so and people like to zap a lot , so this is the order . channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . the other ones are the settings , and they are used less than zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that we can we could have like a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . and if we look at the market , f people from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , i do not really know how to describe this , ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this product , while people that are above thirty five years ol years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five would not actually pay for this thing . i what the decision to be made is , but that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and , most likely , but we should discuss this together . and that is all i have to say about the matter , . shall i what do i do ? do i give this to someone else ?", "user interface designer : right . so now i need to press f _ eight , what is it ?", "user interface designer : . this my presentation about the technical functions design and tried to focus on just what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . so and like thought about it myself and looked on the internet . and so i like it is really important that we get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . so things like keeping buttons together that like close together that are used in the same way , or maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the leas to a minimum , and also things like is it can you c y small enough large enough i am not we c i we would need to do some research about , i would , about what size is appropriate and that thing , but we need to make that it turns on and off the t_v _ . does it have like capacity to change the channels ? does it do or do we need to have like functions for cable or v_c_r _ ? and then , is it findable , and how do we wanna do that ? and thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , if this will work but and we can find something that is more fun to look at and use than either of those . just i like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , but we sh can think about things like colour and size , shapes , that thing , to best fit the user . that concludes my presentation . you need the little thingy .", "industrial designer : right . so this is on the working design , which is the mechanical functions of the remote , and the method i used was to look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . so we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the t_v _ . and also we talked about a location function where maybe you could press a button on the t_v _ and it would send signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . so the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , input which would probably be buttons , although we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , something to transmit it to the t_v _ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . and also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate thing that we would have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their t_v _ or stick it on their wall . and this is just an overview of how the remote works . power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the t_v _ . and then for the location function , you would have a sender on the t_v _ which would output some signal , we could use i_r _ but we would probably wanna use radio instead . that signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be , battery for the energy source , that way you would not have to plug it in , a button pad for input , we can purchase a pre - made chip which will handle all the processing , i_r _ transmitter to communicate to the t_v _ , that is just standard , so most t_v_s have an i_r _ receiver . probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and i would probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . so that concludes my presentation .", "project manager : everybody . we have we will discuss that and then wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . , teletext is outdated , so due to internet popularity , so that is off the list . , also our remote should be used only for television , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let is be fashionable i . if we have something silver and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . so we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . do let is i we should make some brainstorming , see what we can", "project manager : wha what probably our target group and how it is gonna going to appeal to our target group and the s the buttons and what it does and that thing .", "user interface designer : so is our target group then people so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ?", "industrial designer : i was thinking about that but speech recognition is really hard to programme , and also , if the t_v _ is on it is making sound and the people on the t_v _ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the t_v _ is gonna switch itself to channel one , or it seems like a silly , i am not how you would implement it .", "project manager : if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey .", "user interface designer : so are we gonna have just some a like we will have the buzzer on the som like on the t_v _ itself .", "industrial designer : you would have to have a button on a t_v _ or on your wall or some place since the t_v _ already has power . you click the button , it is gonna send out a signal , and i was thinking , i_r _ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the t_v _ it is not gonna work , so probably like a radio signal like on a cell phone . sends out a signal and then the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably .", "industrial designer : it would have to be sold separately because if the sender is on the remote then you would have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote .", "marketing executive : so do you plug it in the t _ you plug it in t_v _ , this thing ?", "industrial designer : it would probably just stick it on your t_v _ so if you need to find the remote , click the button .", "project manager : so do you think even though we are not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals .", "marketing executive : . are we should that thing be on the thing to put the you s you talking about a home for it . do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ?", "project manager : we probably leave that . i one takes care of the other , like if you can call it then it is", "marketing executive : for the so you have that button , that so there is is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ?", "industrial designer : that is what the phone has , when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it is in the couch or wherever .", "project manager : and like if the phone is under the couch , you might not see the light , so", "project manager : so the two remotes that you had shown r i do not remember who showed them , you did ,", "project manager : they are one looked like it was for v_c_r _ type thing , and the other looked like just television .", "project manager : really . that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have v_c_r _ capabilities .", "industrial designer : so you would need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody is v_c_r_s .", "project manager : and and if we are targeting young professionals and teenagers , it is gonna be d_v_d _ type , that is the technology these days .", "user interface designer : so . , let is see if still though , it should not be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons , like if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a , or you can just scroll through the options u that come up on the t_v _ .", "marketing executive : for we need the we can just design the channels ? power is just a button , and it is not used that much ,", "marketing executive : s and it is usually that red and it is quite to keep it like red .", "project manager : i have seen some remotes that where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it is a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . so you do not actually have a separate power button , it is just", "user interface designer : just i would not i would probably pick it up and just be like why is there no on button .", "marketing executive : even ipod thing , like , i if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a", "marketing executive : scrolling i . because people li seem now the ipod is out people seem to like this thing that there is no know you do not have one two three four five", "user interface designer : that is an interesting idea , it is funny like you f like i do not have an ipod but like i , like started messing around with one of my friend is the other day , and you just and it is funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it is not that hard , .", "user interface designer : and it is . it is really but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ?", "marketing executive : you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then", "user interface designer : like a disc . it is like it is just like the same technology as a mouse pad .", "marketing executive : and then you can have if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing like that , and then it can just be plus and minus .", "user interface designer : so like it is like a little part of the circle that or it so it is just a region of the circle that you can", "project manager : we could we could even have four buttons , like , if that is the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as .", "user interface designer : so volume could be like the top it and the bottom so do you need to", "user interface designer : like , so , i so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it will s like say you are go you are going clockwise . that that means you are gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it will go down . but then so if you wanna switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you are either in that mode or you are in the mode where like it just has like the four like this is channel that way , that is that way and volume is up and down .", "user interface designer : so you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want .", "user interface designer : . so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down .", "marketing executive : and then if you do that it goes , but if you like that makes more sense there is already ones with up and down here , that i have seen .", "project manager : you can o and you is there an extra actual button ? or are you actually you are just using the mouse to go up and down .", "marketing executive : for the ipod you press an w right if you are on the channel let is say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down .", "project manager : if you are gonna this for channels , right , then y would not the volume need to be separate somehow ? like you could just have", "user interface designer : we can go on the fact that it does just work with the ipod . but the only thing is like , ipods are so expensive , like , it has to be is that part of", "project manager : it is the h it is their capabili they it can hold what like five thousand songs .", "user interface designer : i am thinking we could if we are hav so ba but an ipod just has that circle thing .", "industrial designer : and theyare - programmable are not they ? you can put on your songs and then put on a different set , that is probably why they are expensive , they are like little computers .", "user interface designer : like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a shape , like it could be a , because it could be circular , weird like that , just", "marketing executive : it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . because , the other thing , i did not tell you all my presentation , is that people find it find that it is a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote and that is another thing they complained about . , what other buttons were there ? volume we have ts just said that .", "user interface designer : this is just for t_v _ , it is not for or it is does need to be compatible with", "industrial designer : i a d_v_d _ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject ,", "project manager : actually our new project requirements , i am not if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for d_v_d _ or just not internet type things .", "user interface designer : that is true , . so , i know i am not c really clear on what", "industrial designer : but it is to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you do not wanna switch .", "user interface designer : so you would have to have like you would have to have like a function switch button , somewhere

i have to say something about the material which is quite shocking . right , i have been searching the current trends , both on the web and via fashion - watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion , fancy look and feel . next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . and th last thing is the easy to use factor . , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but i suppose that is included in the ease of use . , our fashion - watchers in milan and paris have decided , noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the current trend and therefore we need to go for that if we want , wh whatever our motto is . for fashion , we go for fashion . the fashion in electronics . so we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . and also go for a spongy feel , so the question of our technology whate is industrial designer . as to the material should be limited to i how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , i how spongy can be achieved but that is the way to go . i have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and i prefer fruits to vegetables , but that is just a personal opinion . people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room . those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ? , and finally again with the spongy . it has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our industrial designer should look into that or find come up with a solution that is better than mine . , to summarise these are the points that need to be , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our user interface has more to say about the matter .", "user interface designer : there we go . so that fruit and vegetables thing . i actually was not aware of the new trends in electronics and", "marketing executive : neither was i . it is a trend in fashion , in clothing and fabrics .", "user interface designer : so so , let me get this right . , alright anyway . conceptual user interface . trying we are gonna try to talk about , what how people are actually going to be using this ipod - ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design . and , , so , this is a touched ba a touch - based graphical interface system . , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . i assume , are we still on the screen idea ?", "user interface designer : if we are gonna have to ha if we have this it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the wheel", "industrial designer : you need a screen with music because you are looking for a specific song , like that band or whatever . with t_v _ channels it is , one two three . so", "user interface designer : but like if you think about it but if so is it just . so , b you are gonna have to switch to like d_v_d _ and like other things like that , are not you ?", "project manager : that was one of th i was , i meant to update you on that .", "marketing executive : but the screen can come up on the telly , the she said .", "user interface designer : so anyway if we just we need to so if we are not gonna have a screen i was thinking . so it is just gonna be a wheel then ?

something briefly about themselves , we will do that by going round the table quickly and saying what contribution you are looking to make . so we will start with andrew .", "marketing executive : my name is andrew i am a i am the market research person for this meeting and this project for creating this new remote control and i will be presenting information statistics on what people want to get from this new design , what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view .", "user interface designer : i am kendra and i am the us user interface designer and i have not had a whole lot of experience in this thing before but i am so i will be working on the design .", "industrial designer : i am the industrial designer and i will just be i presenting about the inter workings of our little remote control and", "project manager : very quickly , this i do not want to make this meeting too structured because the whole idea is that it is a think tank . everybody says what they want to say , and we do not want to be constrained by convention or slides on screens or anything else but briefly th this is what we want to do . the the remote control needs to be original , there has to be something about it that other remote controls do not have so that as soon as people see it they think yes that is different , i want one , and that goes along with being trendy , the i want it scenario . user - friendly as we all know , remote controls can be very user - unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up and think yes that is it is obvious how that works , and they also want to look at the price and think that is something that i may not need another remote control but it is such a one i am gonna have one . and last but not least , or first of all , it must make the company money , and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants . the the further work to be done is i the functional design , what it must actually do , the conceptual design , how we actually present that to the consumer and th the detailed design i is how we get that into production . now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is the white board and let us very quickly do what i what it says in the prompt slide here , i suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the wires , that we do not do that , so i everybody knows what whiteboard is so we will do a virtual drawing on the whiteboard of your own favourite animal , but le let is go round the table , your favourite animal .", "project manager : my wife says my beard looks like a badger is arse of the white streaks in it .", "user interface designer : probably a duck i li i like the way they look and they are just animals and i like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever .", "project manager : fair enough . i am not that i have got any favourite animal to be quite honest , homo sapien because of their overall ability to", "project manager : yes , tha that is and w we need to keep in mind here that the we want to sell this for twenty five euro , we want to m make an overall profit for the company of fifty million euros so we are looking at selling a lot of these ag across the entire planet and we are looking at a gross profit of fifty percent . it needs to cost twelve euros fifty to make . so we are not only looking at a very trendy original product , we are looking at making it at a very good price . , would anybody like t like to start by giving their o quick views of current remote controls .", "user interface designer : i find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and it is handiest when you have one that works both the d_v_d _ player or whatever and the t_v _ as . , but that it is easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons", "user interface designer : and so it is is best when they are clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you are supposed to use ,", "project manager : any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the problem ? or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ? are there , bad ones they have used or good ones they have used or ones that they have lost and never found again ?", "industrial designer : it is important that you should be able to when you press the buttons it will actually pick up the signals from anywhere and you should not have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it the t_v _ to actually pick up the signal .", "marketing executive : think a lot of the time , remotes that come with t_v _ players and t_v_s and d_v _ players , like they are not like an area that is put a lot of effort into , they are very boring , very plain . like it is very a very like making a stylish remote control would be a very like easily put us one step ahead of the current competition .", "marketing executive : . something that looks does not look like remote control . so if you want , something that looks like something that makes you think what is this ? like this pen does not really look like a pen , but it makes you think . so , that is a bit vague .", "project manager : d no do you think there is a risk if it does not look like remote control , people wo not see it as a remote control and", "marketing executive : i suppose that is up to the marketing to make people aware of the product .", "user interface designer : something that is comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things and they are awkward to hold onto , so something that is more comfortable that fits in a person is hand better .", "project manager : th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops and s some quite fancy ones than the some from personal experience which look but are not particularly comfortable . any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or", "marketing executive : from the mouse idea you could , remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press , whereas if you want could all be flat and the buttons are very almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device you push into device you see , like a mouse button .", "project manager : yes , the only thing is if you are watching television in a darkened room you need to be able to", "user interface designer : but maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be down so you could feel them better .", "project manager : that is must admit i do not think i have ever seen one with concave buttons , that is certainly be different . do we need it to i ca not think of any re remote controls that i know of that actually light up . do we do we want", "project manager : . so , andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there and that we want to t take over the entire the planet with ?", "marketing executive :  , especially if we try to sell , what two million of them . , four million of 'em , but if w if we market it as not this you c you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two we could have parallel marketing s schemes where you have got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks , is fashionable and like you just it is like it is one that rather than ra i wan i want rather than a need relationship with the device ,", "marketing executive : but that might considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks , therefore they want it so make it practical at the same time . it is this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room but also a device that is practically sound .", "marketing executive : we will have to decide which angle we are gonna go to or both .", "project manager : i d an any facets that we identify w we aim need to aim for all of . first thoughts on the industrial design side .", "industrial designer : it is remote controls are a unique object it is you depend on them so much , but you do not i it is you just assume they are always gonna work , you do not think of them as a comp like a computer can break down and you are kinda like fair enough there is all these complex things going on , it is gonna something is gonna get messed up eventually . they they just need to be very dependable because people take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it is god forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel it just it needs to be very effective , very always dependable . i do not think we should make it too small i it needs to it ca not be too big like you were saying big an and huge and awkward , but also if you make it too small kinda like how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller , it is just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and . but so yes dependable , and have a good medium range size .", "user interface designer : most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey , so maybe we should go with something different or be able to i was just thinking of what they are doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different what are they called ? like the face - plates", "user interface designer : that you change so we could have maybe i if it would be feasible to do something with that , where you can change the face - plates or have a variety so people can get different things . have it look how they want to , different colours , things like that ,", "project manager : again i do not think that is ever been done before , it is the thing that would get people thinking yes that is something that i have not got and might need andrew , any thoughts about how we might market interchangeable fronts on the remote control ?", "marketing executive : we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour or with like you buy it with several you ge you get the f the face - plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing , but maybe thinking of that , it is considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray since it is the thing where y you generally get one and then forget about it . unless you were trying to", "industrial designer : you could come up with like novelty ones , like they have done with the mobile phones , you can get like different scenes from different movies and on the remote control and sorta stagger the release of them", "industrial designer : and get people like i want that cover on it now and that will keep them spending money .", "project manager : we have got a good idea now

briefly go through the notes of the last meeting just done in note form and i have not attributed anything to individuals , because we are working strictly as a team here and n nobody is working equally , so . we s we saw that the problems with existing remote controls were the b a boring shape and boring colour . and we s we saw that the what we needed to do was to make the device controls several items , that switching was easy , that you should not need to point the thing at anything in particular , that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that has not been done before that we know of . should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms . and that people might want it as in addition to their existing remote controls . and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you use it . and that it should not be too small , that it gets lost . now i will shortly ask for three presentations . before i do that , however , i will go through some new project requirements that the management have placed on us and will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting . the ma the management has had it is own thoughts on this and the they do not necessarily agree with what we thought . and then we will as a result of that we will then talk through the functions that we see the device actually b carrying out , and we have forty minutes to do this in and i anyway . now , the n the new requirements are the management team see that teletext is no longer of any importance given the rise of the internet . and they want it only to cover televisions . now , what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they do not want it to cover teletext or whether they do not want it to cover , videos , d_v_d_s , satellite boxes , which we saw as being fundamental to the exercise . the the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only . and on that basis we need to bear that in mind , but possibly keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they no longer they do not look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things . the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours . the logo being at b the bottom of the screen there , the two r_s in grey against a yellow background . now this does not necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market . but do introduce some constraints as to how we might do that . it also has to be simple , which to some extent goes along w with the first one , and that we have already said that it must be simple that is what people want anyway . but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , which is their choice , but we need to talk that through . , so after the meeting it will be summarised and notes sent out and etcetera . we will first of all have individual reports from everybody . again i there is no order of precedence here so i will leave it up to you to who thinks they would like to go first ?", "project manager : if you click on the one that looks like a projection screen , no the one to the right of that .", "marketing executive : that one . these are functionality requirements from the our guys down in the research lab . took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what is needed by people and what they want to see . everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how often they are used and how much their necessary and . and general opinions about current remotes . see that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . so some a new style should be incorporated that is less ugly . along with looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they would spend more money on it . which is a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it would be more cost effective and we can put the price up . current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . empl i kinda take that to mean as they do not they , they only use they only work for the television or like as in my flat i have got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a d_v_d _ player , a video player and t_v _ . if it was th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes are not really matched to my behaviour . again , seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . i took to mean that they just they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume . and , the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , wh if we got a remote that like we will have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but and we are going to see on the that some of the functions like audio settings are not h hardly ever used and used very are not considered relevant by the user . so maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , and frustrations of like people losing remote control . maybe some system of you press a button on the t_v _ or maybe that is b it would have to incorporate , but like some system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . maybe like it will beep . and , the time taken to learn new remote controls is do not want to make it too complicated , easy to use for new like first time users and . and repetitive strain injury , i suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use have to make it , fewer buttons , like i was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . maybe do not even have to hold it as such .", "project manager : gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get r_s_i _ from their television remote , is all say .", "marketing executive : but . it also asked if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would . and there was another section on our on the report for l_c_d _ displays , but the data was not there , so . i do not actually the results for that were ,", "project manager : i must say that the i c ca not remember what f phone service i was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked remarkably , so that is a thought", "project manager : and it cuts out i was gonna say , you ca not get a lot of r_s_i _ , j just get jaw ache .", "marketing executive : so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . , i have got some other things i could not fit onto this presentation . it is it is a bit . i will read out to you . functionality , like people is opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they are used . so like the power . using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on t_v _ is a high relevance of nine , but it is not frequently used . whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance", "marketing executive : is used the most . m we can maybe even start to cut down on or i was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . maybe like a folding ledge . so that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , which are low relevance and rarely used . and keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily", "user interface designer : it could be i was just gonna say maybe like the flip phones that they use ? have you seen the new mo mobile phones that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , so you could have the most used buttons on top and flip it out .", "project manager : i wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons if we went for voice recognition , given that the age structure we were looking at w we had usage by age structure , what we did not have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . do we know whether they forty no for forty five to fifty five age group , to put myself right in the middle of it , u use remote controls to a great extent . yes we", "project manager : that would ' ve speech recogn right . so , we are looking at again , we the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups .", "project manager : if we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it .", "industrial designer : p the only problem think of with that is if you have got a lot of people that do not wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . if you just take away everything that they are used to knowing , that is gonna be quite a change .", "marketing executive : you could just put it down once on top your t_v _ and never have to", "user interface designer : have a big like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the t_v _ and then it does not matter where in the room you are , you wo not lose it .", "project manager : it c it see technical problems with that in terms of the , the sound from the television ,", "project manager : because if somebody actually on the television says , i_t_v _ and you are watching b_b_c _ then it might change itself ,", "project manager : just to activate it . or just to identify that you have lifted it up and it is use . and and then just say , i , a thought and then that would certainly be truly different . audio settings , nought point eight percent . if they were not there , would people miss them ?", "project manager : w we need to s identify things that people actually need and it is a function of frequency and relevance . and i would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , the channel and volume and th w given that we have been told to ignore teletext . channel and volume are the only ones that would appear to be essential .", "project manager : . so if we can design something that looks interesting , know , or looks different , incorporates the logo and the colours and we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it is the yellow and grey , and , buttons or buttons as an option .", "marketing executive : you were saying about it could technical problems of like someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed we could maybe have like an activation word .", "marketing executive : i have seen this used on computers before , where you just you address the remote ,", "project manager : if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say", "marketing executive : i am just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote .", "project manager : s th this i th that is always gonna be a problem . and i s so i suppose one could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . anyway , carry on . do you want to just carry on with or", "marketing executive : i was just kinda wrapping up there . i was thinking , maybe such things are relevant . we could make things much more f the eighty percent of people would spend more on a remote that looks better , combined with decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we do not really use much . alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and it might turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . but , since if we are marketing a more fashionable approach then it would it would be fashion and fashion over practicality .", "project manager : s s we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it", "marketing executive : we could even have it as like a the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time ,", "marketing executive : so , if we could power on and channel selection and volume selection , would not have to really", "project manager : the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper .", "project manager : no , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it , visually very distinctive .", "user interface designer : so the method , i looked online for examples of other similar products and then just was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and identify what the necessary things are , what people are what you really wanna have a remote control do . and then there are two different kinds that i found . there is a user centred one and an engineering centred one which i will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . these are the two different ones . this one this is the user centred , it has quite a few fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you do not use . so , what a remote control is you it is to send messages to the television set , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . and so for this product it is gonna be television only , and then it has to have the logos for the company and the colours . and so , for my personal preferences , this one is easier to use and has quite a , fewer buttons . we want something that sends messages easily to the television and i was wondering about this example that they have . it looks narrow at the top , and i was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , then that would be easier . and so we have to decide what is gonna make our product different . e the unique style , maybe have it light up so it is visible in the dark , the changeable face - plates , and the lighting up and visible i was when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up like that , so it is easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch like that . that is my presentation .", "project manager : can i i am actually gonna use the it is gonna great technical problems over here . i am actually gonna use the", "industrial designer : they might be movable . they are all they are not connected to anything on the table , you just leave 'em on and walk around with 'em .", "project manager : yes , rather than the traditional , i wo not even go that far . something like this shape , something that you can that is a more vertical shape , that you hold in your hand , i am trying to think l such as something you hold up like that , possibly with a couple of buttons like that , but with the entire top with the , the infrared or whatever source . so that , it is flying off in all directions , so that again the n need to look at the technicalities of actually achieving that in terms of whether the , the power requirements of the such a source , compromise the our need for , it being permanently , available . whether different technology th all these remotes are presumably infrared , and like they have been for a long time . we possibly need to be looking at something different , short range , not like the old radio remote controls where you would change next door is telly when you change yours . but i if we are going for i if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as i say , r know , really bite the bullets and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum , possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off . and nothing else . so that it can al it could almost end up like that , but again , except that the risk of losing it . anyway so kate , wh what are your thoughts on this ?", "industrial designer : i ca not did you could you see it on you screen when it that is not .", "industrial designer : anyways . alright , so i will just do my presentation on the working design . just at the m the whole method of how the remote control works . the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the t_v _ or the d_v_d _ player or whatever . and it does this by , you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages within the remote which will then be sent to the television , the d_v_d _ to tell that what to do . and you need a user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and the user interface is that is just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it . just general findings . what we need technically speaking for the remote control is some energy source , some user interface , which we have mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . a circuit chip within that to control and send the messages and a sender and receiver . and this is just a little schematic diagram of what we are looking for . this just kinda represents the energy source which feeds into the circuit chip which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between so it will light up once we start once you start pressing buttons . also send signals to the infrared bulb , which will be the part that actually what ? sends signals to the television . and then you have got your happy little t_v _ watcher there . and so my personal preferences think we need sorta big energy source that wo not die out , perhaps some rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in , so it would constantly be charged , so you would not have to be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you . a wide range sender - receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from anywhere in the room , and the channelwill still be changed . also definitely a user - friendly interface and we have all mentioned adding a locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily . and that is it .", "project manager : it seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make before we your point about the big energy source is a very valid one . i do not suppose we have got any statistics on the life expectancy of remote controls , particularly independent ones . given , the number of things you buy these days , which , have a lithium whatever battery in , that is , never needs replacing . perhaps we should have the disposable remote control , one some typical usage . the battery will last know , five , ten years . by which time when all is said and done , the digital television will be taking over in that time scale .", "project manager : p perhaps we should , know , reduce the , the moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment", "project manager : and if anybody manages to run it down , we will give 'em a new one .", "project manager : it is , it is what it saves in cost and there is a it is actually a marketing gimmick . it is hardly a gimmick , it is practical . so i th think the idea of a rechargeable one is unless you are really high tech and it just recharges itself if it is n by , magnetic waves or whatever , if it", "marketing executive : it could have like know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time .", "project manager : it is i know that somei times my wife goes out in the morning and says i should have put the phone on to charge and then she is had those for so long that if she has not worked that out by now .", "industrial designer : . , when it turns itself off , that is when i plug it in ,", "project manager : is the we are really going for the ultimate in ex external simplicity here . cut cost within the manufacturing and , if we have a high tech interior , then that sh may be cost effective .", "project manager : certainly . i ca not think of anything off the s top of my head ,", "industrial designer : most of them , do not they have a combination of the two , like when there is light , they will work off the light , and if there is not , they will kick into this battery , so we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery , but if there is enough light , then it is using the light , so that it is not actually draining the battery all the time , but you will have the battery there for when you need it .", "project manager : th this needs going t into the technology a bit . the actual time that a remote control is actually operating i would think is i is probably , no more than minutes in its entire life .", "industrial designer : it depend if it is depends who is using it , who is just sitting there clicking ,", "project manager : if , but i say if people are getting r_s_i _ from it then perhaps we are looking at the wrong market", "marketing executive : like this market research thing says number of times per hour that it is used , channel selection a hundred and sixty eight", "project manager : i must admit i had not i would missed that . that does sound excessive .", "marketing executive : but then again , if you think it of the amount of , amount of use it is like that is it is less than a second , .", "project manager : and i do not even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed , or whether it is just a sorta tenth of a second , no matter how long you press it for , i do not actually know .", "user interface designer : though with digital t_v _ , like i know on my cable box , you are not supposed to do that because the channel ca not keep up with it if you just press it like that , so you are supposed to use the menu and go through the different channels that way instead of", "project manager : right , so i have got a message to say five minutes , how long ago that appeared . we are getting", "project manager : right , so i would i need to sum up very quickly here . we are looking at extreme simplicity . we are looking at a radically different shape . possibly no buttons , but if you can incorporate channel change and volume buttons in into the design , then that is fine . in the role of the user interface des designer becomes b more important here , because , shape is no longer an a serious constraint . but we clearly only need th the main buttons , although , if clearly only need the main functions . i do not see why we should not go for voice recognition and the only buttons

up with some interesting w suggestions for our new remote control . i will again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they are ugly and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better . they have got lots of buttons on them that people do not use and find difficult to learn . and people lose them . and we we thought that f for our new remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , that we are we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that people use . that we want to go for a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , a _ as a trendy remote control , and b _ as a real reaction product . so that w when people are happy with that , they will want to buy everything else from us . so again , i will we will have the three presentations from the three of you and then we will make a final decision . and the decisions that we need to make today , finally , are what energy source we want to use , whether i it is practical to use a long lasting one . and our discussion was around the fact that if we are gonna go for a long lasting power supply , then it is sealed for life and if anybody does manage to run one down , we will give them another one . and it will be , prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it is , for life , guaranteed for life . now the internal chip and this is where i need kate is expert advice and given that th this has to go to market as quickly as possible d do we go for a custom designed chip ? or or do we buy one off the shelf and programme it ourselves ? i am n not an expert on these things , but presumably , there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify . but that is your area of expertise . and then the , the overall design of the case is kendra is field and we had some discussions last time as to how we might go forward and we will finalise those da today . and thi this is all linked in with the user interface , whether we p go for voice , buttons , or a bit of both . and then , f for the next meeting kate will be looking at the s the look , feel and design , kendra the ho how the user actually uses it and andrew the product evaluation . and kate and kendra will be producing a model for us to look at . so , if we can have the three presentations again , and p perhaps you would like to start k .", "industrial designer : p there we go . , i will just be talking about the components design . and looked at what exactly do remotes do . they for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated into light signals which are then seen by the t_v _ . the materials we are gonna need to look at the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip works in conjunction with a diode transistor or resonator , two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . what happens is you will press a number or give a voice command and this creates a connection within the remote that allows the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a morse code format . this signal is sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the t_v _ and seen by the t_v _ and which changes the channels . so as for how we should end up using this in our remote t couple of main questions are the buttons . y the fewer buttons you have , i the fewer internal connections and internal codes you are gonna need . however to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and raise the production cost . that is something we should think about . also we have to work within the company constraints , and the company has informed me via email that they are experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most cost - effective way of producing it . also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , so i was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back - up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that will last the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea . we also need to look at the chips , v custom - designed versus off the shelf , and the custom - designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all seem to have upon . , however that is gonna cost more , but the off the shelf is gonna be cheaper and it is gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , but it is going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like voice activation , which have not really been used much on remotes , so there is not really chips out there that would be easy to convert ,", "industrial designer : so if we were definitely gonna go with the voice option we would probably have to design our own chip . and that sums it up .", "project manager : d inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . do we do we know by how much ?", "project manager : and and do we know how long it will take to develop a custom chip .", "industrial designer : it a lot longer than an off the shelf chip . w , we did the problem is the voice technology is not really highly developed ,", "industrial designer : it is still in an ex experimental form , so it would it is hard to predict the time .", "project manager : we need to make a decision here . given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply , that would appear to effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology . now before we go round everybody else , does anybody h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ?", "user interface designer : i have a question about that . does it make a difference if there are just a few commands , if you can pre - programme in like numbers one through ten and pre - programme say , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you have programmed in say b_b_c _ four as your channel one , as your favourite , it is like to have a certain number of favourites", "industrial designer : once you have got the whole voice chip in there , then it is the world the sky is your limit ,", "industrial designer : but to actually the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working .", "project manager : i must say i find it slightly surprising given that , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . so i d for slightly different no , it is if you speak somebody is name and it will dial the number for you , so bu the this information is from is this is the internal company information , is it ?", "user interface designer : hundred and fifty pounds . as opposed to the twenty euros , twenty five euros .", "project manager : true , again but if it is without any p price informations that is difficult to decide .", "marketing executive : also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them , not just that , so .", "project manager : . it is like it is you ca not mobile phones are expensive , you ca not say it is the voice recognition bit that is . i su i if given that the technology is not developed and given that it is never been done before , th the double risk , perhaps we ought to stick to buttons , since the last thing we want to do is present a product that does not work .", "marketing executive : i was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost .", "industrial designer : it is fundament i it is something we have discussed since the beginning , so i th in our minds it is fundamental , but i that the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that , so you have to", "user interface designer : i kinda think if we are gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing .", "user interface designer : anyway , i am incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it .", "marketing executive : it is the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative . from my presentation show , so .", "project manager : i it will have voice recognition if that means we ca not afford buttons but b second question , do we need the five buttons for channel change , up down , volume up down and on off , just as a backup or just so that people can j just sit there pressing buttons ?", "user interface designer : . , so i did some research on the internet and what the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there are just a variety of choices . findings , so a lot of times they tend to look cluttered", "user interface designer : and these were just a couple examples of different kinds that are a little bit more unusual . there are some special ones available , like this one right here , which is marketed towards children , different designs , and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a v _ in volume because people some bring a little picture of what ours could look like . so just minimise the clutter , avoid too many buttons and also one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , have the slide button on the side , and then you can pre - programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator .", "project manager : y , if interrupt you . d p do you wanna say anything about slide controls ? the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they are si simple , cheap and reliable .", "industrial designer : they are about the same cost really . it is just the there is a lot of slide buttons out there . it is the same connection .", "user interface designer : just because i n if i am using a mouse i like to be able to slide it up and down so it might be good for volume to just be able to roll it and then have the up and down", "project manager : so three there is three buttons on a slider . three buttons , channel up down and", "marketing executive : if you g if you got a channel up down , we can have a slider in that as . because if it if you no if you notice on the thing it like has got if it s like sticks , if what , up like one unit , if you see what . so it kinda goes up one , then y like you can keep rolling it up , but it is like a cog . so you kinda take it up one at a time .", "user interface designer : the only advantage i was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you are just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it is easy to n s know , this is just the volume and this is the channel .", "industrial designer : ye , i have definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa , so it would be kinda good to have them be feel completely different . you would you were fiddling with .", "project manager : we have to come up with is the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and know it is going to do . so we are looking at sliders for both a volume and channel change of one sort .", "marketing executive : depending on the final shape of it , you could have like , it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb ,", "industrial designer : if in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling ,", "project manager : it it seems to me that it al also has the advantage that it the two are clearly different ,", "marketing executive : here we go . this is my report on trend watching . the data is come off internet from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer . and we got reports from paris , milan on new fashions . and the most important aspect is the l the look it has to look fancy , look and feel instead of the current functional look and feel . this is a st i was gonna say twice as important as the second aspect , which is the technologically innov innovative side of it . so and the third being easy to use is probably a given , we have to try and incorporate , so", "marketing executive : exactly , . i s that out of sequence ? , and from the fashion watchers from milan and paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera . clothes , shoes and furniture and a spongy material to be used on the outside .", "marketing executive : fruit and vegetables , important to this year important to furniture , i am just gonna say f like it is in if fashion if we are going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is the line we got ta be going through .", "industrial designer : that can kinda tie into our changing face things , like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates ,", "marketing executive : we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it and then we can just whip that off and", "marketing executive : that is c . you have we could if we could save depending on the cost of the product itself , could we have a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ? instead of having a ten year guarantee ? with interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out .", "project manager : it its i that is an interesting idea , it is like the old swatch watch where on only batteries ever got changed in those , people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion , but it is just never been seen as a fashion item before .", "industrial designer : it is easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one , because you do not feel like you are investing in a whole new product .", "project manager : w we can b but my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , a long time . but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it is even better .", "project manager : i n i know the only p the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it y you have then got the connection", "project manager : and you have immediately got a unreliability , whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that the whole thing is all , completely soldered together and it , total reliability ,", "marketing executive : or , but like more than just the battery , like a complete different like you have only got like , like th this bit is the bit you keep , and this is the expensive bit , this is like the chip and this is the microphone . and then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees . and then", "project manager : i th i s if we are gonna go down that route , then we are talking about even if it costs slightly more than that , just building the whole thing in one , then having getting cheaper production costs", "project manager : and , giving people the option of buying a new a complete new thing , the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they do not it does not have a cover on , it will still work . then if , if people lose the cover , they might be inclined to go out and spend however many euros on a new one rather than a complete new re remote .", "industrial designer : that is just it with the covers , you are tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they are being ripped off having to buy a new product .", "project manager : it is up to our marketing people to ma turn it into a fashion item .", "project manager : and , as external fashions change , then we get new covers on the market and , readily available . and", "industrial designer : and that is the thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very quickly .", "marketing executive : do not worry it is all said , i was just gonna say are we gonna make this as part of like a part of the f like it the fashions apply to furniture , so are we gonna make this part of the furniture ?", "project manager : it is the thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their coffee table to say this says something about me .", "project manager : i , i am with it , i am up to date . and , th the design that i have got , and it could be a home - made design , this says this is not just a television remote control , this is , a fashion accessory . , so the basic shape i is what we given that we have got one on off button presumably , two buttons for channel change and one slider and nothing else , w we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing . and , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and i do not suggest we make it look like a banana , but know the organic , curved look , t to deliberately get away from the , the square look of most current remotes and , whether the , the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . or there is certainly , the corporate logo needs to be prominently displayed so that people s th looked at it and say right , that is a real reaction remote control , i want one of those .", "industrial designer : that we should make the whole thing yellow i kinda thought with a you would have like a yellow circle with the r_r _ in it somewhere on it ,", "project manager : i d i agree , we are simply it is simply required to incorporate the corporate logo prominently .", "project manager : th this is the whole point , yes , i am i have got a real reaction remote control to go with my real reaction coffee maker or whatever . and then people , people demand more real reaction .", "user interface designer : i was kinda picturing like maybe a shape that is almost like a mouse . so that , when they hold it is because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it , but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and have the power , wherever , somewhere .", "project manager : no that there is the sim my idea was something a b probably a bit fatter than this but tha that sorta shape", "industrial designer : it a mouse you are kinda just resting on it , you want something you can definitely grip .", "project manager : but held , so it is you sorta hold it in your hand like that , i with , and fiddling with the buttons .", "user interface designer : so , maybe a little wider than this , this is pretty comfortable to hold , and then if you had", "industrial designer : maybe almost like a hairbrush , like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top and you can fiddle", "user interface designer : and then it would have a l wider thing to have the light , the infrared light at the t_v _ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume and the power could be wherever , up the top . what do you guys think about that ?", "marketing executive : that sounds i am just i am suddenly realising that we are discussing how much how good it is gonna be to change channels t we still can just tell it to . are we starting to get away from the voice functionality of it ?", "project manager : we d we decided that w we are actually going down both routes . that the we n we need the manual controls and that they should be of that form , but that .", "industrial designer : but do , this shape also les lend itself to voice if you are holding it and you are fiddling , but you can also bring it up like that", "marketing executive : maybe we cou like w we are leaving out the buttons for the f less frequently used , but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice .", "project manager : i th honest my personal view is that if it is not there , people would not use it anyway .", "marketing executive : i suppose , but t there is the off chance that , th the brightness is wrong on your t_v _ or the contrast needs changing .", "project manager : given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will work .", "industrial designer : you can still i incorporate the voice with less buttons . if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands , and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness and sc", "project manager : if we are i am getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available .", "user interface designer : so i we could have a menu button as . we could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume . so have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume .", "project manager : if we if we are going down that route , then we need some display . do we need some display ?", "industrial designer : and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness , and you would use the scroll , scroll through it .", "marketing executive : on a onto like a mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually a button as , you could press it , you could press that and have it as a menu button .", "user interface designer : that might work . it is like the mouse where you just kinda click it . you just press it . and you could just click that to so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select .", "project manager : we got five minutes to go in this meeting , we have actually very conveniently just come to a good point to s to sum up . b kate and kendra now go away and pa play with a bit of plasticine or play - dough ,", "project manager : whatever it is on the other side of the atlantic . and actually put what we have discussed into something i was gonna say concrete , but that is a slightly inappropriate word to something that we can see and andrew n can go away and th think about how we can actually market this as a concept and not j not just a simple remote control .", "project manager : for simplicity of , manufacturing and maintenance that we will go for a long term battery source , on the basis that , if we are going for making it a fashion statement , then people are more likely to change it anyway before i it runs out and make an assumption that we can aim for a battery that will last most people for we will say at least five ten years and that we will w we will guarantee it for five years .", "project manager : we are having a custom chip , but given the we have cut the functions down , that will hopefully not be too problematic , but given that technol technological innovation is important , then we need to , i will say it again , technologically innovate . we , know , we must resist any efforts to try and water that down .", "project manager : i i interchangeable case seems to be important to the concept . it should be cheap , if we avoid any , electrical connections . and i , i if we can come up with some way of allowing people to actually personalise it to whatever they want , then this is new .", "project manager : we d we whether that to what extent people do it or not , but if they have at least got a good selection of covers that they can use anyway , and if we can keep them , rolling , then so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to a any of the famous supermarkets , i wo not mention any names , it is good for the supermarket and it is good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better .", "marketing executive : and are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or", "project manager : the that that is because we have got so few buttons that it that actually makes that redundant .", "project manager : and the that solves one of the problems of b of battery life , that would clobber the battery life ,", "project manager : so no , given the nature of the buttons we are having , it is actually unnecessary .", "project manager : so

those microphones . it does not have any on , does it ?", "marketing executive : alright . one of the biggest issues i found about from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these remote controls and that this is an opportunity to really take real reaction in the direction of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . so my main goal here is to re - envision the remote control in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . some of the research in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and that means we do need to make some decisions about what keys or buttons on the remote control to perhaps keep and what ones to discard . and if we devote some energy into this , the recent productions of real reaction , the i go everywhere power and the high definition d_v_d _ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . and the high definition d_v_d _ players and all of this will come along in the will only benefit from the positive feedback from our designed tool . again , most users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . fifty percent of all these numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . and eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are a lot of television , d_v_d _ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy .", "industrial designer : could can i ask where these figures come from , is this market research we have", "marketing executive : it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money .", "project manager : now in between , as the project manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be", "project manager : that teletext is outdated and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for t_v _ with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan .", "marketing executive : we can really focus on this remote bring the real reaction brand in and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly do not advertise for the i go everywhere line . an interesting element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question . these market research questionnaires looked into your concern about technology and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition . now the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and luck lucky for us have the cash to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . very interesting , i leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this if and , the designers , but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five", "marketing executive : especially in terms of growth , this would be a very smart group to target . s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and with the technologies improving , if we can get these", "project manager : in real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ?", "marketing executive : but would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and did i know that it was an that is a very good question . i if speech recognition should be included , but it is an interesting that maybe shows more about being open to technology .", "industrial designer : how d i am wondering how ou how our target price compares with the typical price of these things . i expect an industrial designer should know that , but if we are aiming to build this thing for twelve euros fifty , is that a lot or a little ?", "marketing executive : exactly . i did not receive any information on that , but the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what is in the pipeline is very important , because there is a question about do you want an l_c_d _ screen and that was not responded to , but some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , so it turns into something perhaps you all have seen the osbournes where ozzy osbourne is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a small tray .", "marketing executive : no , no , you kate , you are exactly right there . but the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology and they will be", "project manager : but we are not looking at whether they are early adopters on that screen , that is looking at age groups .", "marketing executive : exactly . i yes , and i am making the leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than older people . or comfortable ,", "marketing executive : the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is up to the designers . and this is also supported by the market research . that is my contribution .", "project manager : alright . and we will turn to the next presentation . she said we do not need to screw it in , just stick it in . and then press , what ? f f_n _ and f _ eight . next to the control button on the bottom , and then f _ eight at the top .", "industrial designer : and if you want it to go into slide show mode , it is that little button there .", "industrial designer : i you can if you like , it that just sets it up to do a p", "industrial designer : no that one , that one there . left , left a bit , that one , .", "user interface designer : right , technical functions design . first off , i do agree with what sarah has defined as your personal preferences , yeah . we need a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions . so my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . and what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions the same as what existing remotes have . if we can build on this with the speech recognition , that is not something i would thought about , but it is also something we can discuss . and i presume we can miss out the functions really to a video or d_v_d _ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , satellite , cable , t_v _ remote control .", "user interface designer : these are two models of existing remote controls . the one on the left seems to be a fairly standard universal remote control .", "user interface designer : it has fast - forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . it also has seems to have channel up and channel down , which is more what you would expect from a , like a sky or cable remote control where you have got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one . but we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything , i do not think we need them . we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and an enter function where you can access it is not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that would be far outside our budget and what we want this to do .", "user interface designer : it really exceed the requirements , the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions , which is more a text on the screen thing than actual buttons o i was thinking something some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user - friendly buttons and a menu that you can access . but then i do think we need to discuss the speech recognition possibility .", "user interface designer : no . but we could go back to the pictures of the , what are they called ? the pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them ,", "marketing executive : maybe afterwards we could do a whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a basis . whiteboard session .", "user interface designer : i was just i will just resume something else i was gonna say . the the style of these is terrible . i really think we need to not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand - held device , colours , just every e , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised .", "industrial designer : cheers . , i have not actually got a display on my screen . still , i will do without that . , now i wanna bring us down to earth again i am afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work . and this is the methodology i used in preparing for this meeting . i have been doing a little bit of web - based research , and if i had a design team , i would have been discussing my ideas with 'em . but the net result is that i have come up with a first cut for the working design that i would like to discuss with you . so , let is go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . it is for sending a message , typically via infrared . and the basic components we have got to build in for our twelve euros fifty are an energy source , the user interface and which will in incorporate an integrated circuit that actually composes the message based on what the which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message , and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . now i would have hoped that is my only slide actually , i would have hoped to do you a pretty powerpoint slide of my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you will bear with me i will do it on the whiteboard . so we want an energy source which is there . and we have got to think about what that might be .", "industrial designer : we do not want wires on this thing . typically it would be a battery , but i am open to suggestions . then we have the user interface . and the main components in there are the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver . those are the basic things that we have got to get in for our twelve euros fifty .", "project manager : . but those things as long as we can get those components , the block , that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of what does it look like ? what do the buttons look like ? what does it feel like ? that is where the user interface is really coming into its own . the technical end is what is actually gonna be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . the battery energy source or what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? is there any because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for d_v_d_s , movies , whatever . does it have to have a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency ?", "industrial designer : i may be wrong here , but i would been thinking of this device as being a cheap mass - produced device . we are trying to sell four million of 'em , that is almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . and i had not thought of it as being a reparable thing , you just if it goes wrong you chuck it out , and that is why i am a bit concerned . i like the idea of speech recognition , that is a great idea , but i am not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit .", "marketing executive : do we have ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ?", "industrial designer : i am hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that , if you are asking me ,", "marketing executive : be because then we would ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea .", "user interface designer : it does it does seem as if we are just to do something really simple and mass - produced , the which is the same as these existing models , just maybe a little bit more inspired ,", "user interface designer : but just the same . although what suddenly came into my head is , how they always take two a_a _ batteries which is really not very efficient . could it be possible to have , like a rechargeable internal battery , like an m_p _ three player does ? with that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever . you could , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it is recharged for ages and ages , and you do not have to worry with replacing a_a _ batteries , which are", "marketing executive : that has another element , which is if every time you are done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you then it has a place .", "user interface designer : but then again i d i if this is within our price range or not .", "industrial designer : that is a very interesting idea , but i am not a very good industrial designer and i much about what these things cost . i will do some research for the next meeting .", "industrial designer : solar may not be so good when you are watching t_v _ in the night ,", "user interface designer :

held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition . and then steph did a second presentation that those functions plus streamlining them with big user - friendly keys that were easy to use . all of us with those things . kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard that it should be a simple mass - produced device , because of the twelve and a half pence cost . but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . and the new requirements that it for be for t_v _ only and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the corporate design be included . the corporate image . so we that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the t_v _ , but it still should meet those parameters . and that the function we was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand - held . at that point we that sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what do the current ones sell for . and steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics . kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . and i was to type up these minutes and work on the final report . is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was ?", "project manager : right . so we are ready to close that and go back to our that one . we are up to the point of the go back . the three presentations . so we are going to pull the plug on me and turn to sarah . is that alright with everybody else ? especially since kate asked to be last . sarah , i am if i misspelled your name , i did not know whether it was s_a_r_a _ or s_a_r_h _ .", "marketing executive : first thing i want to address is one of the points that florence brought up , which was current cost of the competition devices , similar to the ones that stephanie showed us and they are twenty to sixty euros , depending on branding .", "marketing executive : some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end . but that with the current price that we are searching for , we are within , even on the lower end , of the market . but i am going to move on to more interesting more vibrant things . so , i investigated the remote control market in greater detail , and my the theme of what i was to work on was trend watch . and", "marketing executive : i know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research , so , i am just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here . what is hot , fruit and veg . and this is all over the catwalks , paris , milan , and i am talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . this is really interesting change from past years , because it is much more organic , some would say approachable . and if we are to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . i also did a little research on what again are the most important priorities in decision making about purchasing . functional is out . and f the fancy , and that is exactly the term , i am thinking polished , elegant , innovative , but a cut above . this is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative . this is interesting , in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , but maybe what is innovative is having it simple with technologically superior fabrics or , designed in interesting substances . again , pretty low , it is the top three , but each of the fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . so we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit themed sleeves .", "project manager : it sounds like the covers that they use for the remote , your t your cell phone .", "marketing executive : exactly . i was thinking though that instead of having something like patterned , so , something similar to a summer dress . , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy . they could be ini initially we could start with fruit that would suit a long hand - held , so banana , pineapple and pear . it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development and the remote control , we would just need to get reductionist on it . they could be interchangeable , they are spongy , that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love 'em , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own . so what we are talking about is changing . everyone has a t_v _ remote , but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit . that is what is hot on the catwalks . this is my this is what i am thinking .", "marketing executive : but what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need a remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , i am thinking the teenager , the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers .", "user interface designer : so when your dad is sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we are gonna watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we are gonna watch this .", "project manager : actually some households do have three and four t_v_s and they would have a remote for each one , so .", "marketing executive : . so this is an idea and i this is exactly what the research has shown . so i really open this up to any other feedback . this spongy fruit and veg .", "industrial designer : we are gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this .", "user interface designer : and as for budgeting as , if we are gonna have lots of different interchangeable components .", "industrial designer : we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . i suppose rubber is the closest to spongy ,", "user interface designer : i was thinking titanium , i was thinking it is just i have been influenced by pictures of ipods , and they are also minimalist and shiny .", "marketing executive :  . they are and they would fulfil the first priority , which is fancy . many of us would associate those with fancy . something else we could do is call it something that is fruit and veg oriented . we could call it the name .", "project manager : are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product ?", "marketing executive : it would be a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . so", "industrial designer : w w would it be helpful if i described the components a bit , because it would give you maybe bring this discussion back to earth of what we can actually physically do .", "user interface designer : you can even have them in different flavours as . so that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour ,", "marketing executive : i was really thinking a lot about the i _ the imac gel gem tone .", "industrial designer : some of this you are gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things i have to tell you , but i am afraid this is the real world . so i have been looking at the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and i have had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what is actually available , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they have got , but i am not that it is quite what you want . now this is not a very good overhead , but this is just to show you , this is the innards of a remote control . i really need a pen but does my mouse work ? can you see my little mouse pointer ? this is this is the a remote that is been opened up and that is the back of the interface . and this is a push - button one , so you see these little buttons here , they are little rubber buttons that go through onto the board at the back and they push these buttons here . and we that is the basic construction that we have got to accommodate . we got to have something that pushes the little buttons that talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the message to the receiver . i wan i wanna go through not just addressing the points that you made , sarah , but doing my presentation in the order i wrote it . so first of all i wanna talk about what possibilities we have got for the energy source . we can have your bog standard double a _ batteries in a replaceable little compartment . we can have a hand", "industrial designer : a wind - up , which is quite an interesting concept for a remote control , but i it maybe is does not quite go with the fruit and veg .", "industrial designer : where you actually get the energy by moving the device , which is quite a ni a and neat one . you have to it means that if it is sitting there for a long time it probably wo not work , but you have to throw it between your hands every now and then , it will work . or we had talked about solar power , but i thing that we that is not so good in the dark . now i am afraid this is the options we have got on the case . it can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , or titanium . and the nearest we have got to st to spongy there i is rubber , but i am gonna come back to the advantages of titanium , and it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but if we wanna use standard components , we are gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that . what does the interface look like ? push button , that is the one we are all familiar with . we can have scroll buttons and the scroll button can incorporate a push , so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel like that and push to select something . you can have multiple scroll buttons , this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , but it is it the technology is there . and we can also incorporate an l_c_d _ display in the remote , but this will increase the cost . the electronics that actually makes the device work , we have got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this . if we want the cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . all the other fancy interface designs go out the window , i am afraid . pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . if you want the advanced chip it costs more , but it that is what you need if you want the l_c_d _ display . and the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed sample sensor sample speaker devices . i what that is , but they think it is quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . ou our real expertise is in push buttons , i have to say , but maybe you think that is old technology . and we have got two options . we can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , it , wo not necessarily l look like a pineapple , but that may or may not be a good thing . but it could have an l_c_d _ screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the company is new development of the sample sensor and speaker . so ,", "marketing executive : that sounds good . any idea you mentioned that there would be a cost difference . do you have any idea if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve euros fifty ?", "industrial designer : i am afraid i do not have that information available . manufacturing did not actually give attach any prices to any of this , i am afraid .", "marketing executive : because , what , i am being quite serious when i say that the things i mentioned are hot . but the important thing might be to choose one .", "marketing executive : if what you are telling me is some of these things are not just f are not feasible , maybe we could something about naming , we could call it , blackberry .", "user interface designer : bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company ,", "user interface designer : so what i had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it .", "user interface designer : but i how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the real reaction company . it is just what i would understood we would be doing . that is before i heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit - wise .", "industrial designer : which would allow say a banana , but unfortunately i see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , we ca not do anything fancier .", "user interface designer : shall we ' til i have showed you what , my extensive presentation on what interfaces are available .", "user interface designer : you did seem to include just in more detail what i have got though . so so mine is a bit pointless . f_n _ and f _ eight , did you say ?", "industrial designer : i if you do f _ f_n _ f _ eight again , it is it will", "project manager : keep doing it until you get it in both you get it there , you get it yours without that one ,", "user interface designer : right then . i do not actually have a huge amount of different information then what kate says , just that my method was to look at the , my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar thing , including m_p _ three players , like , hi - fi remotes , not just television and these things .", "user interface designer : having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual plastic or rubber hand - held piece . i have been especially interested in the ipod style scroll wheel , which i could not find a the picture of the ipod w only linked to a web browser , so i could not copy and paste it , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . it has scroll wheels without a display , but they scroll like a computer mouse . so i was thinking that a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . like i an existing sky or cable one does . like , you press enter and it comes up with what is showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do you can scroll along and it will show you what is on in the next half hour , and you scroll up and you can see what is on the other channels while you are watching the same channel on the screen . but i am also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , which is really and fun and good to hold and , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective . so what seems ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , not fancy but not minimalist , just pretty simple plastic , probably , i was thinking , yellow and black , just because that is the company is colours , with very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , just small along the bottom instead of having the ipod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive . and when you have got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as have it appearing on the screen in front of you , it does not obscure much of the actual picture you are watching . and so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down .", "user interface designer : and and i definitely support the use of plastic and or rubber . titanium would be great , but it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . if we are k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then titanium is too futuristic .", "industrial designer : it is difficult to make fancy shapes in it as , we ca not have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately .", "industrial designer : and the having the screen on the television screen is a good idea , otherwise we are putting up the price not only for putting building the l_c_d _ in , but for the electronics as .", "user interface designer : like when you have got the screen there , it does not have to be anything fancy ,", "user interface designer : just a little menu showing a menu , you go into one menu and then it can have your different options , whether you wanna change the settings or the , your information about programme that is on at the moment . i do not think that is to taxing to s engineer . but as for actually arranging them let me go back to the picture of the kiddie one . and i quite like it , it is just smooth and hand - held and it is got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely spaced out , so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a circle . up , down , left , right .", "user interface designer : i was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , but , a i ca not quite d describe it . you see on the one on the right , down at the bottom , is the mouse . see where the mouse is , like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . and enter in the middle , so you pick your menu and then your different options and when you click on each one , it you can go into a new menu for that . i am getting a bit specific here . really we would have to use something to show you ,", "user interface designer : if i do not think get it up on the screen . the ipod spinning wheel is really complicated . it does scroll , but it is hugely complicated . what else have we got ? them , they are terrible . but they all have this feature of this it is not quite a scroll wheel , but it is a selection in this circle ,", "user interface designer : like up , down , left and right . which is good . and then and then , so either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen , it is got your things like settings and contrast up and down . so all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle . and that is it . look at look at this one .", "marketing executive : it seems that you guys are quite keen on the plastic , perhaps the something reminiscent of the child is remote . do you think we could put it in a fruit colour ? and have it abstract .", "marketing executive : we could call like a fruit name , but it would be a little more abstract .", "industrial designer : . we we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you would rather if you feel if you like the spongy", "marketing executive : i am thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so", "user interface designer : just something else i need to bring to your attention is have you seen these on a remote ? this is actually the volume up and down , but they both say v _ on them , which , when you first look at it , you expect that to be the down , because it looks like a downward pointing arrow , but it is actually the v _ to indicate that it is the volume , so we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these .", "user interface designer : but we would not have a specific volume up and down . if we are having the scroll wheel , then it is gonna double up as all the other up and down functions . but then , that is complicated .", "project manager : i wanna all for all your presentations . we have about ten minutes left , in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts . and you all have been self -

should not take long . then i believe each of you have a presentation . i have was sent a couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . then we can come to a conclusion on what we want the remote to do , and how it is going to do it hopefully . and then we will have the closing . which we will have forty minutes for . let is see , the last meeting we went over who was responsible for what . i am responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , and coming up with the final presentation . corinne is our marketing expert . she is gonna figure out what the consumer wants . ryan is our user interface designer . and manuel is the industrial designer . so you are gonna come up with the ideas ryan , and you are gonna pick 'em apart . we decided our remote , we want it to be a universal remote that everyone would want . we want to be modern , fun , different . it needs to be sturdy , easy to find , so we gonna have that locator function . and we want to be different . and then we went over a couple of different ideas . ball - shaped phone . the keyboard shape . we decided that it should probably be one - handed . something we could use with one hand . and that was our last meeting . so why do not do each of you have a presentation ? i will hand it off to you and does anyone do you wanna go first ? so we can maybe see what the people want .", "marketing executive : that one ? , this is my report , which is going to be based on a survey that i was sent . gosh , i have no idea . g", "project manager : i know . i did the same thing . and then it should come up here shortly .", "project manager : i am not . you could maybe minimise that screen and then have them both up at the same time .", "marketing executive : it is . so first of all , the method that i used was by doing some marketing research , by doing research on some interviews that were conducted . and then some internet research . and i was sent a report that was there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . and so i will show you some of the results from that , which will be helpful . here are some of the findings . they said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . and seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . which is a fairly significant number i would say . and eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . so that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern look , that is definitely important . they say that current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot . and if anyone could clarify what that means ?", "marketing executive : and fifty percent of the users say that they are only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . and there was something else , they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . and some of them it looks like barely need to be included . channel selection is used the most frequently . and then teletext was the next . volume and then power . and then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button . the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . they said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . and twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for r_s_i _ .", "marketing executive : and so bas as far as speech recognition goes , the younger group looks like they are all for it . from the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . and it just went down incrementally . the groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think and decide if we think it is worth investing in this . at least if we are targeting the younger groups . and so in conclusion . some things that i drew from this are that we were correct . we definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . so you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room . we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that do not seem to be serving much purpose . and then lastly that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition . and that is it .", "project manager : very . now we actually have some ideas of what people want , what we should focus on . can i look at that real quick ?", "user interface designer : having just listened to what corinne just said , i will draw on some of the things as . some things that relevant to what i wanna say . so i am just gonna approach the technical functions design . the method i used was to explore the technical functions of a remote control . and t s simplest approach that i came to is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . that is an obvious thing to say , but it is not attached to the device that you want to control . i had some things sent to me . not very much . to look at similar devices . defined in some them . and then the personal preferences that i will suggest . we discussed a universal one . like it is just been brought up again then . but a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , because you would need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . i am not have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself , but you have to i they are a nightmare to use . you have to set them , reset them to everything . and that would only add buttons . whereas the aim is to take away buttons . so it would be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for t_v_s . or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if the aim is to get something that is unique in design . here is just two pictures of remote controls . they are just simple t_v _ remote controls . but one is user - centred . that is the one on the left . and you can straight away see there is less buttons . and the other one is engineer - centred where that is more specified for the elaborate piece of equipment it is trying to control which appeals more to the product that we want , and on what the have said and the market research and probably looking at something that should be user - centred . fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent is hidden away if ten percent is what is used , maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they are hidden away . and the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across . and finally , sort i have covered that , our product should be user interface orientated . like i said to concentrate on t_v _ remote control , a universal remote might be too complex . and as what it , the major findings market researchers have said , it is the image and the appearance that people di dislike . so that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . and that is it .", "industrial designer : gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors which is what dictates the design the both the interface and the outer appearance because this is all the that needs to go in there . so unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me were too drunk to actually accomplish it , so i am going to do a lot of the on the board . just this is the basic premise of a remote control . the basic function is to send messages to another system . so much is clear . an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages . often in the form of infrared bits . this is the most mostly used . there is also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more used system . parts are cheaper as . a user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages . this is where my people screwed up . so i am going to explain that on the board rather . what we have is different components that need to go in there . we will start with an energy source . which is usually a battery right ? since it is not feasible to add a cable to that . this energy source is connected to the user interface itself . which can be buttons , whatever , which controls a chip . this is the user interface and there we have the chip . the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . that sends out the signal . the signal differs accordingly . depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp . and that is controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . the way you normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as , so that it is working . you press something , you get a response . which is also comparatively important on one of those devices . now this , what we are talking about here , or what should be discussed are these two components mostly . the the energy source for one thing can be altered . what we probably can not alter is the infrared , the sending device , the infrared lamp . we can not change the chip which controls the infrared lamp . these two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . it c it does not have to be there . this can be discussed as . the user interface . that is something we can also discuss . as we have heard speech recognition is the hype in the moment . speech recognition interface , we that . or if we just do the usual button thing . or we have a touch pad like that that is something we can discuss . and the energy source . it is always a question whether these components are available cheap enough , developed enough . but that is like i s i suppose rather up to marketing , and not to", "project manager : but people have said that they would younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote .", "user interface designer : speech recognition was one of those things where they have to be really good for them to work . sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if it is on your phone .", "user interface designer : and you need to take into light languages and then different dialects i suppose as .", "project manager : i myself i find , when you , h when there is something like spee speech recognition . like you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power . sometimes they have a speech recognition on the other end , and you say one for this , and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over . i find myself , especially if i am in a crowd of people , looking really silly . maybe if you are sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then , you", "user interface designer : and wou i if would you want to keep saying if you were watching . if you were watching something would you be wanting", "project manager : volume up . change the channel , channel up , channel down ?", "marketing executive : another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they would do it , but probably a lot of them that is actually their parents money . like i if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old .", "project manager : now i was sent a couple of things to modify our new requirements . the remote is only gonna be for the television , which is good because we already decided y your research showed that not only is a universal remote more complicated , it is more cost , more costly . and your re research showed that most of the people do not even use it . you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons . so if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem . so we do not have to worry about that . but we do have to use the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics . and our corporate colours are grey and yellow . and we could probably get away with black too but so those are the three new requirements that i was told we need to use . from all three of your presentations , that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . we want something that looks good . we want something that is simple . we want something that you can find easily . and the speech recognition i is give or take . it is gonna cost more . the young the younger people say that they like it .", "project manager : but it is probably , i would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time . so maybe we should just do away with speech recognition . and that way we can focus on our form .", "user interface designer : i did have a thought about the tracking thing . is that if it came with maybe a holder or holster , whatever you wanna call it . that you should put it back in . but if you do not put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sends out a beep to find where it is . just by infrared . that should not be too complex i would have thought .", "project manager : that would be , that would be good if we were going with our ball .", "project manager : that could be the charger . for we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote . and that would be or solar . or however , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit . with the locator button . and if it were the ball you would no longer have to have a flat space on it . like if", "project manager : i after the meeting we will have some questionnaires . and and some summaries for what is going on . then we will take lunch . then we can come back and work on our individual work . i will do the minutes . it looks like you are already on your way for working with the components . chips , the what chips we need and what how to power it and whatnot . user interface concept , we want it to be something simple . minimal number of buttons . i our , i our main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look , .", "project manager : did you have time earlier to work on that . did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done ?", "user interface designer : i will have a look , try look at the actual appearance in the next break . i th i do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one - handed . the ball is probably not a good idea . and even something that is held like that might be difficult . so that it still has to be a variation . on maybe a rect on a rectangle but maybe not necessarily as boring , as plain as a rectangle .", "project manager : shall we maybe shoot for a specific target group ? that way we could l if it were , if we were shooting for young guys then it is a certain look to the remote . or girls or older people ? would that you think that would help us find a specific form ? that we would wanna pick out ?", "user interface designer : d i if that might cope with like the trend - watching . i find anything more on that .", "marketing executive : not yet but maybe by the next meeting we will have some info on that .", "project manager : . so we know that the remote is gonna have to be we will just say we have got a colour scheme for it . yellow and yellow it is and bright , with the buttons being grey or black . and our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the bottom or the", "project manager : maybe we could sketch a so all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just a rectangular sort . maybe we could flare it . so it is more this will look like a bone then . go ahead and erase this . hope everyone memorised that", "user interface designer : you it might be to look at the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they have been going .", "user interface designer : they have gone from big brick block things , which is a remote control is , to slinky small things .", "project manager : everybody is got a mobile phone right ? except for me now . but they are all , mobile phones they have taken a turn to where they are really small . which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time . but then again you do not want like the first mobile phone that was this big and you had a handbag to carry it around in . we have got what remotes look like now is what we are stuck with . maybe we could go with a square .", "project manager : with minimal number of buttons . i you have got one through nine . for typing in your channels . you have got volume , up and down . channel up and down .", "project manager : that is that is all you need . a menu button , maybe . if you , if we want the remote to do other things like or i the t_v _ to be able to change the tint and the colour and all those things that are built into t_v_s , we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in , press the menu button , scroll up and down to select it .", "industrial designer : talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not too bad . it is talk about maybe f look at that from the side , there maybe . which is technically the easiest option . would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this .", "industrial designer : like that . you can even if we are coming from mice , we can even add a click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down .", "industrial designer : also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here . just which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the batteries and so on . what i am getting at here ,", "industrial designer : fel look at it from the side . it is like that . then you hold it in your hand like this . and maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the side .", "user interface designer : to the thumb maybe the buttons could like decrease in s the bigger ones they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here .", "industrial designer : you can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open . with the lesser used functions on this part ,", "user interface designer : definitely . just like o on a side view . something that it would fit in the hand better . so you just have your hand", "user interface designer : that is also true . instantly always going for the right - handed person . but the older so", "project manager : is everyone who in here is right - handed , left - handed ? you guys all right - handed ?", "project manager : i am left - handed but i , so say that most things are designed for right - handed people . like the written language .", "marketing executive : maybe you could buy like a special left - handed version of the remote . special order .", "project manager : maybe . i would say it should be probably designed for a right - handed p person . but that is good . that is w we have got a good plan there . at least for what buttons we are gonna use . so we have got i like the scroll , the scroll action and the .", "user interface designer : i am just thinking maybe if it was circular with the that the early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , whereas this is just a one - handed thing that you almost wrap round the thumb . so you would have your , you would put your hand into there with the thumb there . and then your thumb would do you would have all the buttons round here . and that could work . if you just had it like wrapped round there . left or right .", "industrial designer : . then there is maybe another point of making it a two - in - one

channels up - down , volume , and on - off .", "project manager : so two remotes in one . but then would be easier to lose one or the other .", "industrial designer : means the big one has to be

oriented remote , something simple . and that we did not wanna go with a universal remote , because increasing cost and increasing complexity . we would just have a t_v _ remote . and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . have it s be something that looks different . and finally our industrial designer gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . from energy source , what we would use . batteries because we do not wanna have a cable . how that would power the remote and the lamp . if we were to have one . the user interface then would connect to a chip , which would work with the infrared controls to send the signal to the t_v _ . i believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . something that will fit into easily into someone is hand . and with a , just a few buttons . just the basics . and with a scrolling function also . and i will leave that , leave it at that . we are watching trends .", "marketing executive : so i was looking at trend - watching . unfortunately i was not given too much information . i was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . and then i will just tell you some personal preferences that i got from that . the most important finding was that the fancy look - and - feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look - and - feel design , which we have already discussed before . the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . these are all things we have already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . and thirdly the remote would be easy to use . as far as fashion update , we have learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . so that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try . and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . so from that , as we have already said , we need to focus on a fancy look - and - feel . we have already discovered that it is hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . but that , even if it is very subtle , we need to trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they are getting something that is new and modern and sleek and whether it is through the shape or the colours or all of that . for technologically innovative , we have talked about the tracking device . we brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . and manuel had suggested the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , that we could change a little bit . we need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . i , i the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable .", "marketing executive : . or with exterior designs . but my question is , the stereotypically speaking , you picture males with their remote controls , and i am not how they would feel about having fruity logos on the outside . so maybe we could have something that is somewhat removable , or i , different options for female , male target groups . and then the spongy feel . i we could look at mobile phones and other technology that is out there . c and look at different types of material that might our users who want spongy - feeling remote controls . so that is that .", "project manager : just to butt in for a second . possibly like a cover like they have for mobile phones ?", "project manager : you have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that is a spongy", "user interface designer : why ca not i see the crazy . i talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . so i have looked at some of the i was sent , try and get some inspiration . but keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . i was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . they gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . there is different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . there is a graphical use , where you look at pictures and on a screen . a command line where you type things in , and you get a response . and then it ju that is just to point out the inconsistent u use of interface in remotes . you ca not really see that picture , but there is various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated . so , then i had a look at new products that are on the market . not necessarily remote controls but ones that you will recognise . this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . i have a there is a picture . you surf your favourite channels with your voice . store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , t_v _ , cable , satellite , v_c_r _ , d_v_d _ and audio . and you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . so the technology is there . the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side . you can just make those out . and then on the right is an ipod , which is possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , and really is , and all that is just a big scroll menu that y you go through . that is a possibility . and nothing is simpler really . then there is things like this , which is a kid is remote , where the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . so the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . and it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . so i if there is a possibility of having one remote contr like we just had two components , maybe it can have more components , different remotes . the point made at the end there here is that you have to be need to be clear on your devices , as to what , things you use . sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a v _ for volume . just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . , d carrying on from what i have already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . maybe we have so suggested this two - part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit . and then just have the simple hand - held thing that we devised earlier , as the actual remote . i do not it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an ipod where you just control through the menus . like gets more and more compli complicated . and then the hand - held bit should be ergonomically designed . and that is it . why am i just . just to show you . m they have even got things like that . which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma ?", "industrial designer : let is see . i am going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior . just to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the in there . i have more information on possible materials as . what we can and can not do . but let is just for this to load up and i will show you what we are talking about here . the details of the components ' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . the underside , that is pretty cheap piece of technology really top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of further transistors and like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal it is getting and will do what you tell it . so much for the workings of the remote control itself . its job is to for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , that are received by the television . when you press a key you complete a specific connection . the chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . it produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the l_e_d _ which translates the signal into infrared light . the sensor in the t_v _ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . this is the circuit board from the other side . the lower part of it , i if you can see that properly , with the green greenish board is what we saw in the first slide just flipped over . you can see the circuit board itself . that is the cheapest way to make electronic connections on the market . what you do is you have , do not have cables , but you have the connections actually in these lines on the board . these are the actual keys that are being pressed . they close the electric circuit . that then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . that would be behind here . which sends it over to the transistors and all that amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . now as you can see this is the rubber button version of it . the way it works is that you have the keys here . the rubber button has a little metal plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . and thus gives on the signal . now this is the simple version . we are talking this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . we are talking something more complicated , it is going to be more expensive as . and not only that . we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . i have gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , rubber , as . rubber that is used in these anti - stress balls . so it is pretty squishy . that would that would serve that purpose .", "industrial designer : fya i do not have an information on that . however our company can provide us with the titanium , so i assume , i am , i was given an to use it . it certainly is an expensive material , i am aware of that , but i was given an . but there are certain restrictions to certain materials . now let is first go through the list with the materials . so we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . can also mix these . as for the energy source , we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . what we could use is , or what i was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . interestingly enough . we could use solar cells . or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . such as like watches . where you just move them m move the actual device and this pr provides it with some energy . so i personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . you do not wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right ? solar cell is interesting . may fail though , every here and there .", "industrial designer : . or you lose it , it lies behind the couch for a week and .", "industrial designer : exactly . the kinetic energy thing might work , but the same problem . you leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it starts to work . so i would say what we are stuck with really is the basic battery . which also makes a base station obsolete . we do not need that then . however our interface options are push - buttons . in which in the production of which or in manufacture of which our company is expert . however we have discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . and they are possible . we have an for scroll wheels . however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the ipod i have one big objection and that is that we have to fit an l_c_d _ into the remote control as . this however may exclude certain materials . if you have a squishy remote control , then an l_c_d _ screen may be affected by the movement . hence we might not be able to put it in there . so there is also restrictions to , when it comes to the chip . if we have a more sophistic sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic set - up that we that i have just presented , the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as . i do not have any details to , when it comes to the cost but it will be a significant difference . i would rather say drop the titanium and therefore let is have a more sophisticated chip , but that is not up to me to decide really . so that is for the scroll wheel . it limits our choice and squishy is hip , so i would say rather not go for that . let is see now . solar cells can not be used on a curved or latex surface or remote control . but that is not our problem since we have decided or against solar cells , i assume or is anybody still", "industrial designer : which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional i assume . with the titanium we can not make it a curved design . we would just be able to make it flat and a straight design . which i assume would exclude some of the more sophisticated versions .", "user interface designer : would the spongy and the plasticky thing y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have a s a cover on it which is just soft and .", "user interface designer : so i if that would still be possible to have in plastic . but then where do people hold it ? just all be spongy .", "marketing executive : the we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it .", "user interface designer : so you as the possibility of having a graphical display on it , like a screen ? like the ipod ?", "industrial designer : you can have an l_c_d _ screen . but therefore no rubber will be used .", "industrial designer : alright ? so plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will influence the form . with plastic , as i understand it , you can use any form . latex is tricky . or rubber and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . so the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , add an l_c_d _ screen , and then you can choose either plastic or titanium . if you wanna make it a particular shape , use plastic . add an l_c_d _ screen , add a scroll wheel , that will be fine . or make it just push - buttons . plastic gives you the b biggest variety of options . maybe not the nicest feel . or not much originality really .", "project manager : so the ru the rubbery we can shape it however we want ? or the rubbery we can not ?", "industrial designer : with rubber we could sh shape it the way we wanted it , but we can not add scroll wheels , and we can not add an l_c_d _ screen . that is the tricky thing .", "user interface designer : could we not have a shape with a scroll and the screen , and then j just that initial shape we had , just which is banana - esque . so that is thing if we did it yellow . and you just p stick on just rubber things that grip the thumb bit . they would not have any they are just on the exterior . they would not be necessary to the actual shape of the thing .", "project manager : is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ?", "industrial designer : s certainly can be done yes . if that does not affect the functional side of it all . like say just the underside or so then it can be done . the fruit design how about affecting the surface of the actual remote control ? say we do not make it p a particular fruit shape , but give it like the surface of an orange , banana , whatever .", "user interface designer : you could just sell it in different colours as i suppose . in different ye yellows .", "industrial designer : grapefruit is what we would go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps .", "project manager : i would say , if i were to make a decision , i would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower end of the spectrum of importance .", "project manager : perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit - minded remote buyer .", "industrial designer : so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana ?", "project manager : couple of grey stripes . we could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that person could turn it over .", "user interface designer : it could and then you could actually h put the banana - shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , and then people would always know where it was .", "project manager : maybe the holder , if we were to have a holder , it could be shaped like a fruit .", "project manager : could be , it could be an ape or a fruit bowl . we could have a variety of options here . do you have more to your presentation ?", "industrial designer : that is it . i informed you about the materials , what the interior has to look like , and what the limitations to certain materials are on there you go .", "project manager : like i said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here .", "user interface designer : we rid of that because gonna use a battery . and the base station might not be necessary .", "industrial designer : we can still design a two - piece remote without having a base , having one of them be a base station , but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece . we can still do that . however this would be like designing two remotes .", "industrial designer : so which then , as i understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive . say like have a scroll wheel and on both of them , or have an l_c_d _ screen and so on . you would probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button design which we saw there . but could be done , .", "project manager : so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , the chip - on - print , and the case . probably case material . and probably a shape also . and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what the type is . and what supplements we will have . energy source we have , we have decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet . and we have five minutes .", "industrial designer : when it comes to the chip - on - print , as i said , the more advanced features you want , the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . if you want just a normal button version , the chip - on - print is gonna be a cheap one .", "project manager : i we should pick the case then . if we go with the plasticky case , or the plastic case , then the chip - on - print is still , we could have either or . we could have a complex one or a non - complex . but did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ?", "project manager : so i the case would be plastic , with perhaps that is not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . it is more of a su it is more of a supplement maybe .", "project manager : i that , is that about it ? so we have a good idea of what we are gonna need to do on this ? so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . here is what is gonna be going on . ryan you will be working on the user interface design . manuel you will be working on the look - and - feel design . corrine we will want a product evaluation . and the two of you get to play with the modelling components and maybe and get us a prototype . which should go along with your look - and -

after that with any changes that we will need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . let is see , minutes from the last meeting . we looked at the trends . we had the fashion trends that people want a fancy look - and - feel . it was twice as important as anything else . they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . and a spongy feel . so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . then we looked at the method for coming up with our own remote . looking at other devices . the ipod , we really liked the look of that . we also had the kid is remote for a simple idea . a two part remote , which was what were originally looking at . and then there was talk of spee speech recognition becoming more predominant and easier to use . but we have still decided not to go with that . then we looked at the components the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of

interface designer : we st went with the colour yellow . working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it is designed around a banana . but it would be held in such a fashion , where it is , it would not be that floppy this would be hard plastic . these would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . so that is so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . you have to use your imagination a little bit . and this here represents the screen , where you would go through .", "user interface designer : and the simplest functions would be almost identical to an ipod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . volume up and down . and then to access the more complicated functions you would you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . it is that simple . that just represents the infrared beam . that is a simple on and off switch . i , we could use the voice . t that blue bits should be yellow , that would be where the batteries would be i suppose . and that is about it . it is as simple as you , we could make it really .", "industrial designer : that is what we have there . that is plastic . plastic covered with rubber . we might add some more underneath here . maybe give it , give it a form . you are supposed to hold it like that

important . so you do not have to fiddle with that . that is not i would say a bit smaller would probably be . you wanna play with that over there .", "user interface designer : and whether or not it would fall into the cost everything i suppose . with the scroll and the l_c_d _ .", "project manager : luckily we are going to find out . or not luckily . do you have a marketing presentation for us .", "marketing executive : i do . you guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . so first i will just discuss some of the criteria that i found . just based on the past trend reports that i was looking at earlier . and then we will do a group evaluation of the prototype . and then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . so the criteria we are gonna be looking at are the complaints that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . so we are gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale . and one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . with seven being false , we did not achieve that . so for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ?", "project manager : it is definitely different than anything else out there . so if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes i would say , i would say most definitely .", "industrial designer : i would say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and , yes that is definitely more beautiful than your average . however the colour , we do not have a say in that .", "industrial designer : that has been , that has been dictated by the company . so to answer that honestly i would rather say like , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely .", "industrial designer : is nothing you can say about that . i much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form . but", "industrial designer : it is different . you do not want your three feet

do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ? does that sound good ? what do you think ?", "user interface designer : we have brought it down to four controls most common , which are channel and volume .", "user interface designer : and then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further .", "marketing executive : ? the fourth one . how about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? one of the number one complaints .", "user interface designer : it is bright yellow . bright yellow is hard to lose . but if we were to , if we were , that ,

lost . but like i said , like i do not think you would lose something so yellow so easily . and it is not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . that is gonna be a difficult

manager : but if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit .", "project manager : probably two . if we eliminate the fact that it is impossible to guarantee that it is not gonna be lost then i would say two . with the speech recognition , which may be changed depending on budget .", "industrial designer : y you could add an extra feature

control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . it is probably ca not email this to you , i have just got a web page with some data on it . it is saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls . seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .", "marketing executive : eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they are watching television . fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they have got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that .", "project manager : yes , mayb maybe you can send an email to me later .", "marketing executive : . so there is a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control . , power and volume selection are only used a few times within this per hour . , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times and then there is things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . teletext is used fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . an interesting thing that this report has brought up is that fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , so some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users .", "marketing executive : thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that is easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps .", "marketing executive : thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one .", "project manager : they think that or do their doctor the doctor says ? but it is the opinion of the users ?", "industrial designer : so these are important numbers that matthew and i need to take into account for our functional", "marketing executive : i need to muck around with this . it is probably easier if you put it on yours and then i will just email it to you . it is just a web link .", "industrial designer : these numbers have to be taken into account for the both user interface and functional design .", "marketing executive : one thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the hang on a minute .", "industrial designer : because if there are many numbers and we need to select to constraint our design based on what is more important .", "project manager : it would be a solution for when your remote control is lost , when it has speech recognition then i then it does not matter where it is , my it is we should be in range , or maybe it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is . but the these are all quite fancy features i am not whether we will we can make this for twelve euro fi and fifty cents .", "user interface designer : . , it depends like there is it is a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three ,", "user interface designer : it is not going to be s so easy but u usually it is going to be more of an isolated case", "marketing executive : this is now talking about who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , . ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five .", "marketing executive : it really depends where we are gonna be targeting this product , which we will be talking about later .", "marketing executive : . so that is the figure that i was just talking about there , with the different demographics . another thing it is talking about there is the l_c_d _ screen but there is no figures on that .", "industrial designer : as everybody knows i am the industrial designer . and in this presentation this group presentation is gonna focus on the working design of the remote control . i would like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you do not have a very technical background what is it because in the product it is important . the basic function of a remote control is to send messages to another system that is fixed . and so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually through a infrared bit and the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages , alright . my method for designing the work design first the main point is that i would wish to make a really functional product . i would prefer to have very functional capabilities rather than fancy that is not used and does not work . for that as it is important to take into account the user requirements from the marketing expert anna and w to we should agree on what are the technical functions for this remote control and i show you the working design . here is a really large view of what we want . we want an on off button , it can be it is simple but it is important , and also the to both channels as other buttons that come after , right . the components i quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the sender and on the other part the receiver so that is my method is will be to my aim would be to design the and choose the chips and the infrared components to build the remote control we need energy sources and the receiver a receiver . this is very quick design , you stop me or interrupt me if you do not agree on it on that . what i have found and after a lot of work actually i draw this i draw for you this schema that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me", "industrial designer : found and th you have always a compromise with reliability and i if it is expensive , but this one was not this one also really reliable so that is it for the working design , i hope you get clearer view on what a remote control is in terms of technical components", "user interface designer : but is it can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma", "project manager : what i w what i was thinking about the schema about the sender and the receiver , can you get back to it ? the receiver is already in the television and we are not able to change it . so we must adapt to the receiver . i suppose there is a standard way of communicating to televisions .", "industrial designer : we will use infrared protocol using infrared and we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists but we what we can do is adapting the chips inside to the best chips and infrared bubbles .", "user interface designer : people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote which could switch off any other t_v_s , so through all the things .", "marketing executive : so if the b t_v _ in the next apartment is really loud , you can just turn it off .", "user interface designer : so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone is t_v _ and you can just walk away you do not have to be near the t_v _ .", "project manager : i feel i m mael will consider this th these things . maybe we can go to your presentation matthew . i assume you were finished here .", "user interface designer : . so take mine now there . take mine it is , voila ,", "user interface designer : like so . i am going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it is about what is the user going to do , my last presented what is going inside , so what is the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it . so the approach is that the idea is to send a message to the t_v _ set , as mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the t_v _ and usually we it is easier to have keys or buttons with which people can press and then changing a button will change the message which is being sent to the t_v _ and a and it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver . p as anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you do not need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is s a question which will we have to see later . but in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the t_v _ . and so generally i do not have some figures but so there are two kinds of remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard t_v _ remote where you have just a on , off button and play , volume change and keys for the number and more than one digit option . and if you see righ right now even the one on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but . then there is this is the standard one with without any fancy thing like i it does not have teletext option , it can without any , it is a very simple thing , which you can vouch . and then you have what is the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop and then you play the movie or fo fast forward the movie like that so i it has those these are the standard commonly found remote controls in the market . and then whi which is generally used by the people . and then personal preferences i would think of having a aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the f a t_v _ and the remote video remote control because some of the keys in the video is remote control and the t_v _ they could be integrated together so that we could aim for the like in the f coming future that type of applications with", "marketing executive : how would that work ? you have got say maybe a v_c_r _ and a t_v _ which are separate , so you on my one at home i have got a v_c_r _ remote which then changes the channel on the v_c_r _ and does not do anything on the t_v _ , so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the t_v _ or use the v_c_r _ ? or does it know which one you want to use ?", "user interface designer : actually you could think of having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing but yo you still ca not in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the v_c_r _ option and you could play it or you can also think about having i in a few days you will be ha in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate sitting setup box and you have something like you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you and you can just when you come back you could just switch on that thing and watch a program . in that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those functionalities .", "user interface designer : it is going to record your things and you need the functionalities what you need in both video as in the standard t_v _ thing .", "marketing executive : that is fair enough . but i do not think we are trying to make a universal remote here . that is ,", "user interface designer : no no we are not making a universal remote , we are just looking at giving a scenario , i have a t_v _ and tomorrow i am going to have set up box which is going to sit there and it is going to do that job for me .", "project manager : w w we need to decide on in how far we go to in this . mean , you can go pretty far i f with functions and possible future p prospects yes . but it is good to keep in mind .", "user interface designer : we can always discuss about it the presently the video market actually this demand , video over - demand or what we call it as , it is presently booming up actually it i like people are providing like things like movies , you can select actually you want to watch a movie and your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list . and it you go off , it downloads the movie , it gives for you and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your t_v _ . and thi this is going to come .", "user interface designer : it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time i want to watch the movie", "project manager : so u i have received some points of thinking over of my account manager and i would like to share them with you . first thing is teletext is a known feature of televisions but it is getting used less and less . that is that is especially because of the internet . so we should think about it . do we include it , and do we give it a prominent place on the remote mot control itself . as a in any case it is not used , very much , but it is it is still used . further yes we must think , do we stay to television only , the television as we all know it with broadcasting signals and you ca not go back or do we go further as matthew indicated by supporting recording devices ?", "project manager : and and the hard disk recorders . , furthermore , w we need really need to interest y younger customers and then with younger customers people below the age of forty , and our current customers are mainly forty plus which", "project manager : that is to that is there is a market but they will grow older and you will al always need to have the future with younger people . therefore , younger people like trendy designs , so that is w we should make our r_c _ as trendy as possible but it should also be have a reliable image , so when it looks too spacey or too fancy people will think does it work .", "user interface designer : you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately , but suppose if you take the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , so the space covered so that you do not see two separate keys there actually so it is like i it is like", "marketing executive : . but taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we are going after a younger market ,", "marketing executive : there is lot there is lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls .", "user interface designer : it works . so , you have presently keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and four five six like that and you can have keys like this in form like keys like that", "marketing executive : how much longer have we got for the meeting ? we have not talked about demographic", "user interface designer : you can have keys like which are like so . too , so we do not change the original order of them but then the keys are more spacious , they do not look so there is a very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three , four here five and six , so the keys can be it looks not very much cluttered but it looks for you do not have too many keys but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to", "project manager : now that the idea is clear . we should now try to decide on our target group .", "marketing executive : which is quite tricky . , we are trying to get people to buy a remote control would not they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ?", "marketing executive : it is only a low market , it is a cheap - end remote control , we ca not beat modern functionality , we might we will be able to beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that is not a big seller , if they are not just going to buy a new remote control just it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as . so i am not how we can get people to buy this thing .", "project manager : many people said in your research the appearance of the r_c _ is important when they are buying one", "marketing executive : . but if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they will buy a universal remote . i have got friends who have got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they are using five different remotes for their all their things .", "marketing executive : in that case they would not buy our product , because it does not give them what they need in terms of functionality .", "marketing executive : we ca not , with the price range . we are not building a universal remote , we are not building a high end product .", "industrial designer : we have twelve point five euros per r _ s r_c _ and with this now that chips are very cheaps and we can include it in our control some new features . and but", "marketing executive : but if we are getting into universal remote territory , we are getting to l_c_d _ screens and things like that", "project manager : thi this could be a market because universal remote controls tend to be quite expensive .", "marketing executive : but if we are going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own t_v_s to use a remote control on .", "project manager : people yes . who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a universal control .", "marketing executive :  . i really what the price range for remote controls is . are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we middle to bottom ?", "project manager : when we think it over i thi we are trying to

some minutes again . we will have the presentations of y of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented . and that will", "project manager : we have some forty minutes to complete this . who has the fir do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready ?", "industrial designer : the matthew it is it is important that matthew is here because it is really a team project with a team", "marketing executive :  . so this is just a presentation on the trends that we are gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . can put this on ? so we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it . this is to do this i will not remove my microphone . we used some focus group surveys which i went through with you last time , the main results of that , and some research on the current design and fashion trends that are out there at the moment , and as part of this the important aspects that came out were things that we have already discussed really . the most important by far was the look and feel of it . it needs to be something that is very different from everything else out there . it needs to stand out . it needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . people will wanna buy it . that was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . people have to then think about it and say got something there that i want . that is a really feature , and it has to make them wanna buy it again . third on the list , innovative was twice as important as this last aspect , it has to be easy to use . so they have to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it . drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , fruit and vegetables . this is talking about just the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , eye - catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel . i had a talk to the design people about this , but having a remote that is tactile , that feels different , that would be really . that would make it stand out .", "marketing executive : ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing . spongy is the current texture , but there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile , so if we make it like maybe furry or soft , that will be something that sets it apart , rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment . as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers . going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we have got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables . going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they have all got those a lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is . that is one way of looking at it . textured feel we just talked about . maybe it is another way of doing that .", "marketing executive : so if it is part of the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one like that . so they can choose it li as they want to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever .", "marketing executive : and , still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . they are big selling items . people put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas . back to technological in innovation , not quite as important , but still a big issue . we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it is been lost , that is one thing we could look at . there are other aspects like l_c_d _ screens and speech recognition which were not i do not think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . we are better doing something basic like this which is very important and very will be a really feature to put in . i had no real specific ideas for this , maybe we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe , by themselves ,", "marketing executive : and then th the finer details of buttons you do not use as much either hidden away or completely separate . and that is the presentation .", "project manager : maybe we yes we maybe can decide later on the l the look and feel of i have it was a good idea maybe to", "project manager : yes the there are changeable covers , but on the other hand i whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete new l line of supplies it would be very complicated organisational", "marketing executive : we are selling so many units of this . this is gonna be a mass marketed product , we can afford to have two or three different designs at least .", "project manager : and it will be a we get a if it works we can get after - sales that would be very good those covers could go for three , five euro . that is a very good idea and then maybe we can go a th matthew is presentation because", "industrial designer : and your part is very related to mine because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside .", "user interface designer : so i will go with that actually so m so then the idea of having a remote is generally you have different keys and different structures , different forms , and they could be like buttons and they could be of a varying sizes if you want to emphasize a particular key more than the other , and maybe like you can have different colours having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button . so this is the general trend to ha the method they do . so what i have found was that currently the they are mostly that the t_v _ , v_c_r _ , music system operated ones actually , and they are very specific to each other , but there are some common keys if you want to follow the v_c_r _ and if you want to follow the g s some soundtrack on the w see they have the common thing actually you can have and there is also a speech recognition to store channel information , names , if you have a multiple functionality , say t_v _ , v_c_r _ i say it to the t_v _ and the t_v _ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information .", "marketing executive : i like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like b_b_c _ , rather than having to remember the number of it on the keypad . that is a good idea .", "user interface designer : so you can just because as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v exact channel numbers ex exactly , even if you arrange it by however you arrange it , you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to", "user interface designer : it it is like it limited one . in the present market i saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing , eighty word , which should not be th that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word . you want you do not want to store all the channels in the remote control , you want to st store your favourite channel .", "user interface designer : some ten twelve channel information . you do not want to st store all the hundred channel information into that . and it depends like the remote with l_c_d _ display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities you are watching a movie , and you are having a universal remote control and you want to you really which functionality is now , so i am using the t_v _ so every time i use it , it could be like , use a simple toggle switch , and a display , so i press it so the display says , i am in t_v _ or d_v_d _ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys , to model the functionalities will increase actually , and for you and you might want you do not want separate keys for all of them . there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they are not allowed to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them . so these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present . i personally would look at things like having a u universal remote , is a good idea , instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition . i got a mail from the coffee machine interface unit that they have integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine ,", "user interface designer : and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi joe , like that , and", "marketing executive : but a coffee machine , there is not too many words they would be using with that it is a small vocabulary .", "user interface designer : you wo not be using it , so it is a limited vocabulary thing , and very isolated word and it is it is interesting , and storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing which is again and maybe having something like a blinking thing , like it could indicate you are it could indicate what is cal like the whether you have enough battery in your remote , the blinking . at the same time , if it is a dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also or", "industrial designer : y you want to let the user to programming the keys ?", "industrial designer : and is not that too difficult for the we want w i if we still want the r_c _ to be easy to use , that is the compromise .", "user interface designer : n no but the if you give it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put . like i would like to store in certain way , so if you want to give the full freedom to the user or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint .", "marketing executive : you can have it so it is easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it ,", "project manager : yes but i do maybe you can give a hand to us because i am not whether that we can implement that for twelve euro and fifty cents . i am to have every time i have to come down on this price again to so this might be a little limiting for your creativity , but it is the real we have to consider it . s so do we think these ideas an and my sp speech recognition , maybe it is possible for twelve euro but then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the furry case of the", "industrial designer :  like i would say that for programming keys , you said , it could be easily done within the package of twel twelve euros , but for the a_s_r _ system , i am not if it is feasible to have this", "industrial designer : exactly i if it is a low vocabulary it is already implemented , and w how much it is cost , maybe with a f cheap chip .", "user interface designer : maybe we can come we can talk to them , and we can come with that , and also you can think of having since you have a something maybe if you added little bit of display , you might need the to che keep checking the battery , so you really need a some indicator , so it could be a blinking option of l_e_d _ it could actually be used to detect also . if it is in a dark room you can detect it also .", "marketing executive : i like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark , so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they light up .", "user interface designer : no actually i if i it is like it tells you , it can be for two purposes , like if you have an l_c_d _ display and all those things it is not going to be the standard remote , which is having which need just six volt th three volts of d_c _ . it may need more actually , so y you may need to check your battery usage it and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit . and then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something", "user interface designer : and it can change the colour depending on your how much is the battery , that is good enough to even locate even if you want to .", "industrial designer : what i am gonna present here is very basic knowledge about the all the components that are inside a r_c _ a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you . the method is ther there is a set of components in a remote control like , and what cost the components in themself do not cost a lot but the way to assemble everything costs , and i will show you my preferences at the end . there are two different types of two different ways of using the components for making a remote control . the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some transistors with an that aims at communicating the message and to send the message to the led that will transmit to the receiver . and the other components and the circuit board buttons , infrared , led , etcetera , for the components . so you finding , just to say that the chip can detect when a key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as , with a different sequence for each key ,", "industrial designer : and that is , with the components we will use , we will have different messages , different sequences , and the chips sends that signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger electronic parts are assembled onto printed boards because it is easier to mass produce and assemble . and so for our design we want some b programmable v _ v_l_s_i _ or f_p_g_a _ high technology ,", "industrial designer : and this is important , and also we will use like in any high - tech devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them . my personal design we need to find a solution what is the material of the cover we want to use . if it is plastic or you said that you had some ideas like fruit , veg or", "project manager : m maybe we can give the case a very normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up .", "project manager : so like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , a wooden case .", "industrial designer : they also emailed me that they have available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse . and very cheap l_c_d_s , so liquid crystal displays , so i am wondering , we might be able to integrate l_c_d _ into our r_c _ . and the final point is we have there are some compromise to do . we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip , but the scroll wheel and that higher high - tech needs more money which is a higher price range alright . and the display requires an advanced chip , which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , but with twelve euros and if it is made for four million items , then w we could be able to handle that . to sum up we need said that the components the list of components has to be listed and assembly is a an important process that has to be taken into account . and for the designing of the cove cover layout then it is better to maybe see that with the u_r _ exp u_r_i _ expert so that we can it is really a team - working i can not design something without your agreement , right ?", "user interface designer : i wanted to know like if you want to have a fo if you want to have the l_c_d _ display over there , or if you want to store a programmes with a keys what things you will need inside your thin inside w wh what", "user interface designer : in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card .", "user interface designer : where they do all the wi with them actually . how f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things .", "project manager : i f we should come to some decisions now a about this . so i understand when we want a display we need a expensive chip , but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip , so can we use same chip , so with one expensive chip we can implement several complicated or advanced features .", "industrial designer : exactly that is a very good idea , we could have one main chip that could handle , it is called f_p_g_a _ chip , that could handle both like scrolling wheels as l_c_d _", "project manager : when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is possible in the given budget , maybe we should go for the more expensive chip , so all features which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip .", "industrial designer : also thinking , both if we had a budget of twenty euros , it will be , but .", "marketing executive : maybe we need specific costings then . actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better .", "project manager : wh when you make a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price . that w that would be a very good idea .", "industrial designer : because right now i do not have price in head but for next meeting i am be able to do that .", "user interface designer : that is something which i wanted to ask you also , like what will be the each individually the cost of it . if f if you want to put wood i would not suggest for wood it is m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood .", "user interface designer : it will be much ch much expensive th though it is the most natural thing , but", "project manager : but i think we can just use more cheap plastic for a basic edition , and then people can fancy it up with more expensive materials which come with a with another price .", "user interface designer : it is we can give a preference to them , but it is but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it is much better with that rather than going for", "industrial designer : but i it is a detailed uh plastic versus wood , and we need maybe to centre our description on the really the what buttons what functionality we want to offer to the user , and maybe with graphs or i user interface designer you could maybe help us on that .", "project manager : ma i for next meeting we c you two can present a real design . so drawing it on the board .", "project manager : and then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function . let let is say next meeting w you produce two designs , one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price .", "project manager : furthermore we go for the basic plastic case which can be later fancied up with addit additional , how do you call them , these like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it . but that can be done later . we now can concentrate on the basic remote control .", "user interface designer : we can give them smooth keys , smooth keys with bigger s so that the the problem most of the time we have seen , the keys is that it is small , and every time we have to be very but if i the if we go to a different ways of designing those keys , then you can merge them together", "user interface designer : you can actually , if you see , they are quite small over here , and now you can , as i was if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people . at the same time , it is m more like it would be more interesting for people who are having this r_s_i _ and all problem .", "marketing executive : one i have had before , a r remote control we have at home is one that is actually got a cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , and then you can slide the cover back to get to the more advanced keys .", "project manager : w but then you have still have when you do not use it you have such a an extent of your remote control which you do not use . so maybe it is possible , i whether you can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are buttons you do not use that much .", "marketing executive : i have seen that before too . anoth another like b it flips up and then you have got another layer of buttons underneath .", "user interface designer : yes . so it is something like this , the model here s you can put the keys", "marketing executive : but i have seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as .", "marketing executive : i like this one . i like the shape of this one . can we have can we think about maybe having a non - recta non - rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box", "industrial designer : w maybe we need

the evaluation criteria , so what is important to look at .", "marketing executive : this is what we have talked about already , from the marketing point of view . we just wanna make that we have taken into account", "marketing executive : so it is just a shortlist of criteria on the things that we have identified as being important to selling the product . we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we will make an evaluation based on that , so just average the score of those items , these are the things we identified as being important . the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic . and then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as . do you wanna go through and put through those on the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them ?", "marketing executive : f just go through onto the whiteboard i . not how this is gonna come out . the first one was really very far below budget , would you want to

tell you how good .", "marketing executive : the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel . as it is , not really doing either of them .", "marketing executive : i know some have you

phone , .", "project manager : yes , exactly like it . , so maybe we can but we have to decide it , we can put the fancy f look of vegetables , to these covers and s now try to invest in the features .", "marketing executive : the if we do the cover that is really going with the company is philosophy of having the fashion in electronics , it lets people have the latest fashion even next year when

manager : say , say one and two . le let is see . d this one has spongy but buttons ?", "marketing executive : the average of that is three six nine divided by five , so five nine by five , one point

they are not really comparable yet anyway .", "project manager : both in i or we just have to choose . because , when we choose for this one we have to make it more attractive and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap .", "marketing executive : it is easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out . that will take us down to the budget .",

be possible for sixteen fr euros . unfortunately we did not see this chip , matthew ,", "project manager : yes , re reconsider it . let is try to model this phone in this sheet , what energy source we did not speak about that . it is a it is a normal battery , or", "user interface designer : it migh it it will need more than a conventional one , it wo not be just maybe you might use a a_a _ battery

would be double curves ? , plastic would be the material .", "project manager : one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine ,", "marketing executive : we would have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them . they are not just standard buttons .", "industrial designer : a minute , it is not double curved , it is single curved , because it is there is no like .", "marketing executive : it is like it is curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as , that is what .", "project manager : i am no i am not sh . yes i kno undes i understand what you mean , yes .", "industrial designer : it is this curve like this so , it is w there is only is there is nothing like y in the other there are", "industrial designer : the single curved in the sixteen . that makes seventeen . and what are just the bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you ?", "project manager : we have we have not talk about a , but that is no a is very exp inexpensive i believe but it is not in the list .", "marketing executive : we have got a scroll wheel for the volume do not we , or is it some other thing that is not on there .", "project manager : w ho h is this a scroll wheel or is this a button which can be pressed on two sides so for higher and lower ?", "marketing executive : we have only got five minutes left guys so we need to wrap it up pretty fast .", "project manager : we are we could go for the for a simple chip , but then we ca not have the speech recognition , yes ?", "industrial designer : but the but if you have the near the l_c_d _

buttons we have to make seven to fit in twelve fifty . so is it possible ?", "marketing executive : but that is seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds - on , without special colours or form or material .", "user interface designer : that will be then we have to ask the user to press it several times .", "industrial designer : you can not make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really low ,", "industrial designer : and we do not want to change that we we really want a l_c_d _ other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market .", "marketing executive : twelve euro fifty , we got two off of the battery , we ca not do anything about that , so ten fifty , if we want an l_c_d _ dispra display , that is seven fifty , so we have got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons . the chip is up there already .", "marketing executive : so we are gonna have to scale this down to get within budget , there is no doubt about that .", "industrial designer : so wha what each of us think about the because it is measure point the l_c_d _ , do you think it is important ?", "industrial designer : because sometimes whe when you watch the t_v _ , you have a big display and maybe you do not need one more in your hands ? i am just asking .", "user interface designer : a actually it depends , it depends what functionalities you want to add into it , if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or and you will have l_c_d _ display which is that is going to bring the cost by two euros at least .", "marketing executive : unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the l_c_d _ display .", "industrial designer : but , do we want that ? on the market point of view , . what do you think , l_c_d _ is a major feature , or ?", "marketing executive : for the price , it is gonna be what we can afford , and it is looking like we ca not afford the l_c_d _ display , there is no way we can get it in there .", "project manager : we have to come to a decision now , just we what we just do i is vote about the l_c_d _ display", "project manager : one man one vote . s so who thinks the l_c_d _ disply

speech recognition in remote control and you can go we have here the results of", "marketing executive : to have the s yes and speech recognition . and and the others is not so important but we know that people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot t_v _ and who wh can use a lot this . so maybe we can have a speech recognition in .", "project manager : maybe this is important . moreover th maybe those like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can we have to take care of that point of view or so .", "marketing executive : and if there is th the conclusion now . so as we say before , a remote control lightening in the dark it is a good thing . not to many mud buttons like we said before , e easy to use a way to find it easily in the room and resistant to shock and to an i s no , .", "industrial designer : i am just thinking of some thing . we want to have a no , i if this is a good idea . we want to have a general remote control for everything .", "project manager : no no . we w it seems that we no want to have a t_v _ remote control . from the management board i receive an email . cos it would be costly and also it would take more time to develop to have a general generic remote control .", "project manager : because i received that email from management board and they seems to tell that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should focus on t_v _ more where it seems that the market is more important . so maybe it is a good decision . what is your opinion ?", "user interface designer : i have i have no idea i should know a bit more about how fast we can design it . i do not think", "industrial designer : but maybe continue with my presentation , it would be al you but we have some technical problem or so . so i am just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control .", "industrial designer : so i am just going to describe for a remote control this is quite easy . we just have , i am going", "industrial designer : like that . i am just going to describe . we have a battery a power supply here . after that we just have user interface . let is say that something like that , which could be a l_c_d _ let is say or an array of push button , something like that . push button or a l_c_d _ . after that we feed that into an electronic chip . so i say u_c _ and i feed that to l_e_d _ which is infrared which is a an infrared component . and so what we for myself this for us this is quite easy .", "industrial designer : numerical computation according to your display . and so for us this is quite easy . we just need to take to define what we want to do when the user interface wants something and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to the not the to the television . so for us this is quite easy .", "industrial designer : we just have to define the processing power that we need especially if we want to do some speech recognition , in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple", "industrial designer : and but for a standard one this is really easy . it is a question of one month and so on s", "project manager : so do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now ?", "industrial designer : i would say . i would say about eight months to have the first results .", "project manager : so i it is a bit long . one month for the standard one with button . even if we have a l_c_d _ display ?", "industrial designer : even . that this is really standard devices now . for speech recognition .", "project manager : so we can take this into account . so who think it would be good to go for like speech recognition ?", "industrial designer : during the kickoff meeting you say that we should not go up to twelve point five euro per unit", "user interface designer : how muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units h no , one hundred thousand units . we are gonna need chips right . how much will it cost for one hundred thousand ?", "user interface designer : so you have any idea for a powerful one that has good enough for do speech recognition .", "project manager : it seems that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting .", "project manager : maybe we can look at the new requirement i receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have .", "industrial designer : you say that i do not remember by heart but thirty per cent of the tested people say that is it is quite difficult to use the remote control . do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ? to to maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that .", "marketing executive : would j w they say that it is difficult to learn how to use it but i when how to use it , it is .", "industrial designer : but maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ? you say that i want , i have six button", "user interface designer : mh - hmm . a a lot of people are if you have the l_c_d _ screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them", "user interface designer : but it will be hard to configure imagine i so it is really something for the expert user . there are markets and markets . the young people are th are christine here said you have a it is . so for our young people it will be , they can be able to use it . th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it . i if there is study about that .", "project manager : maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating a simple product .", "user interface designer : and there are another thing is that if we make something that is simple and easy to use that is bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else . otherwise , if it is different then everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first .", "project manager : but also we see that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons . so we may just make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and maybe also some lightning too because most people find also hard to find the remote control . losed lose it etcetera . these these are these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to find when lost it will add a serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop . so but le let us see first the new requirement . so we do not have to so this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we do not have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and like that", "project manager : so anyway we do not have to include this feature because it is not used any more by users , they prefer to s", "user interface designer : i am . i am that it do not like but i do not see just one button .", "project manager : if i one button is still one more button . if if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors . anyway i have this point . we can discuss . also so as i told before it would be better if it is only for the t_v _ because we want to be quick on the market . and then also we have to make very clear that this remote control is part of our products and show our corporate logo and colours on the design as so that they identify it as one of our product . so this is the key point . so before finishing we can define what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera .", "project manager : do you so from the marketing expert a key aspect is the easy to use aspect , it should be very simple and most button are never used only ten per cent of the button are used often so we have to do something very simple and we all agree on that point , no ?", "user interface designer : if it is going to be just a t_v _ remote control it is going to be very simple .", "project manager : so the key point here is simple . so few buttons , channel , volume control and what el what function do you see in addition to that ?", "user interface designer : if it is going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control , there is no other function that see really .", "user interface designer : no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can revenue can come back to us .", "project manager : . volume , maybe a mute button , and then on off button . and that is all ?", "industrial designer : i know that som you say that many people are doing plenty of a lot of zapping . i know tha i discovered that when i did a quick look , they do now som they do something which is quite now ,", "industrial designer : you have a button , you press it , and this is the previous channel which has come back .", "project manager : this is . maybe we can include that also . previous previous channel button . so we have like channel button , the previous channel button , the volume button , plus a mute button , and just the traditional on off button .", "user interface designer : how should they how should we implement that ? because could be numerical only or could be also incremental .", "industrial designer : let is say that we can do something like that . this is incremental , but once you press it for a long time , you go five by five .", "user interface designer : . it is an interesting idea , that if you press it for a long time it does something else , in general . so if you have your ten buttons for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have instead of having just one memory you have if you press them for a long time no . does not work does it .", "user interface designer : maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands . change channel to eight .", "project manager : maybe we have also to have digits or only incremental . bec because if you have the", "user interface designer : if it is useful like if you want to change between three channels then you h you can not work with just memory being incremental .", "project manager : because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it is not it is not worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one . so we need also digits . maybe we can make very obvious the channel and volume button and smaller button down there with the digits .", "user interface designer : when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time and", "industrial designer : or we can do something like that . we can design the remote control to have access . some remote control have protection and so you y", "user interface designer : there is a there is are some with a wheel like this . instead of having the up down buttons for you can have the wheel .", "project manager : maybe we can have a wheel for

wheel but a ball , and you say to", "user interface designer : the channels change one by one . so you have to the user has to like to should feel the discrete sense a bit .", "project manager : that is a good idea . also we have to decide so it should be lightening in the dark because most people lost their remote control .", "industrial designer : is quite it is quite easy we do that w with back

of the current functional look and feel . so it is very important for us to create something new . so what michael just said , it must be some very different from ordinary remote controls . fancy stands for an original look - and - feel of the case and interface . this aspect is the most important one . it came out of the research . it is twice important as the following . the second most important aspect is that a remote control should it technological innovative . that stands for new technical features . and then that this is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we do not make use of l_c_d _ or speech recognition . but this is the second important aspect , and we must use some of the new technology , to be innovative .", "marketing executive : features not do not

study we conducted into what users want in this remote control .", "marketing executive : so first of all we what we did is we conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects . we put them in a in our usability laboratory and got them to , play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they would done that , to complete a questionnaire to tell us what they like and what they do not like in remote controls . so the major things we found out was that users do not like the look and feel of most remote controls that are currently on the market . they , seventy five percent of the people we did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they would used in the past were ugly . completely ugly . they did not match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , the way users use remote controls when they are watching t_v _ . , that the layout of the remote controls did not match they way that they used it . and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that are on remote controls . so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . and from this we came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control . and you can see they are used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , while the user is watching t_v _ . the closest button that was used , the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , all the other buttons , such as ch audio and picture selection configuration buttons and things were used , l approx less than or equal to one times per hour . we also asked users which buttons had the most importance to them , which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on the remote control . and they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very high relevance . and the audio and picture settings had a very that the users thought that w the audio and picture settings were very were not very important to them , and they used them very infrequently a as . so we asked users what frustrates them the most about current remote controls . and fifty percent of the users said that what frustrates them is losing the remote control somewhere in the room and not being able to find it . they also said that it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there is many buttons and it is a , a c a unintuitive interface . and then thirdly , they some users commented on the fact that the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and u repetitive strain injury . we also asked some users about some specific features that they would like to see in the on the remote control . in particular , do they want an l_c_d _ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition is a useful feature to have on a remote control . our findings are that amongst a younger age groups the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . they want these features , they want these high technology features . , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . whereas the trend was as users became older and older they were less likely to want these features in a remote control . so i it depends on where we are focusing our market . and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , we are focusing on the younger target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these high technology features into our remote control . that is my dic that is my presentation .", "project manager : so , maybe now we can talk about a user interface and about the technical function of this device . so pet peter , can you talk say something about that ?", "industrial designer : you are scaring me with l_c_d _ man . and speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive .", "marketing executive : it is true , but , they are features that users want , so it is and our production cost of twelve fifty euros per unit is fairly high , so we can afford to add these features into our remote .", "industrial designer : at least we have couple of months t to work on it so it will be cheaper finally .", "user interface designer : so here is my presentation about technical function design . i will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together . , first what is a remote control ? simply it is a device , as , for sending some commands by some waves to another device to tell different commands with this device . and the main idea we do not use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device . i it has different blocks , different blocks . first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits making interface with keyboard and r reading keyboard and reading the keyboard commands . and then inter then make these keyboard commands , in interpret these int keyboard commands . and then there should be an electronic circuit making electronic signals according to these commands and finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a diode making waves to transmit through the air and this air this wave will be received by the other device like a television or whatever , to r to realise the command . , about what i found about different these different blocks are , usually there are two different methods to for designing a remote control . they are based on infra - red waves or radio waves .", "user interface designer : there are two different solutions . this is this can be the differences the th between different waves , infra - red or radio waves . and also as i understood , and it was a part of bob , presentation , people prefer to have the remote control with less button . so for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should try to t try to design a remote control having some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to search between different options , and showing o something on t_v _ and putting less lesser on the remote control . and personal preferences , certainly a remote control with working with radio waves is preferred because you can pr you can take it in any direction and you do not need to tune it any way . , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as i see . that was my presentation .", "marketing executive : i have a question . do you think radio waves will interfere with other appliances in the home ?", "user interface designer : i do not , because we can make we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency . so they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home .", "user interface designer : no but as i know , there is a range for this f for this , for designing this circuit . we can we can tune our transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we do not need to ask any permission .", "project manager : and what happen with radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , ? and so do they have the same frequency , or ?", "user interface designer : for this i am not i the solution , but one solution can be something like putting p password inside the wave , so the only your t_v _ can understand it", "industrial designer : f i know about this , since it is my it is exactly my field , so .", "industrial designer : it is handshaking , when starting to when you start to communicate with the your t_v _ then it is like an handshaking protocol with your remote . so so if two devices are trying to go to communicate with the t_v _ set then the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . it can be a problem sometimes , but most of the time it works .", "user interface designer : the password may simply or i identification code may simply solve this problem . a specific remote control has a specific f", "industrial designer : but we do not have to think about this because as a function designer that we will use the already made circuits which we probably bu buy . it is worth to buy . and they have these problems solved so . so we do not have to think about these .", "industrial designer : yes . i have only a couple of things because i had i struggled a bit with the software that i am supposed to use in this company . i was used to use linux before , so . but i tried to break through this too , i .", "industrial designer : so i will speak about working design . that is the first slide . what i have to do ? a look at what the other company so presently i am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and like that because i did not work with these circuits so far so i have to look what is a v available on the market for the communication for the i_r _ circuits and so on , so i am currently looking what is available on the web . and i wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , so , i would be glad if you can tell me about them . , findings , that is the point that i am working on currently but so far i was looking what are the blue circuit , radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now ,", "industrial designer : but the prices i read are high . so , i know that the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can make the t_v _ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , but , when you are not close to the t_v _ you probably wo not need to change the program and so on and so i am voting for s to stick to the infra - red control instead of r_w _ but we will discuss it later maybe . components to use , i am not exactly what i will use for the design of the circuit . it depends on whether we will use the l_c_d _ and mainly the speech recognition , because the speech rec ?", "marketing executive : are we are we planning to take an off the shelf an o_e_m _ component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ?", "industrial designer : no no . this we this we buy , because it is rather cheap nowadays and it is not worth to construct ourselves .", "industrial designer : exactly . but i am not about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition . this i prefer that we should make ourselves . but it depends whether we take a decision to use it . it is fairly expensive to use these circuits . so , speech recognition , l_c_d _ it is because it is common nowadays to use l_c_d _ , so i agree on using any l_c_d _ , less buttons good for me as a designer of the circuit . but the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , .", "project manager : so what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ?", "industrial designer : i was not thinking too much about the price . but if we use the l_c_d _ even the radio frequency communication with the t_v _ set and the backlight and related things like the photo diodes and , it should be . if we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we will see afterwards . it depends of you if the m_e _ or u_i_d _ , i am about the names , i do not really know , want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , it depends on you not because the electronic device is price is not so big in comparison to the overall shape and like that , so . we will discuss it afterwards . , this is nothing . this is just my notes on what to use . and my personal preference is yes , i would like also preferably to use r_w _ circuit , but from the point of view of the design and price , i would stick to i_r_s . that is my opinion . if infra - red circuit not the radio frequency .", "industrial designer : because because the range where you can use it is fair . and the price is fairly cheap for this .", "industrial designer : depends . jus just the price . otherwise i do not care what i put there because it is the chip which i buy or which we buy . so it is o y o .", "marketing executive : that is still a lot . it is probably not worth spending the extra money , because all the other remote controls on the market have infra - red , so people do not expect anything other than infra - red . so it is not worth spending the extra money .", "industrial designer : th they are used to use it when they can see the t_v _ so , i .", "project manager : on the other side , we want to have something new . where we want to have something new and so we should still thinking about it .", "marketing executive : but , based on my usability studies i th i feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , the difference between infra - red or radio waves . so we are better off spending money in the usability phase .", "project manager : peter . so i have to inform you i receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the remote control . first , they say that is about something about t teletext . it becomes from according to them it becomes out of date . and because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it is not useful to have teletext . so we can avoid the teletext . the second thing is they suggest that we should use the remote control only for t_v _ , not for d_v_d _ and other devices , because it make it makes it is too complex and because we have not much time for this project we should stay on t_v _ on the only specific t_v _ remote control .", "project manager : the third the third one is about the image of the company . so we should keep the the product should be recognisable . it is that mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is , we put fashion of in electronics . so , when people see the remote control , they should say it is from real reaction and he s they should recognise the company . so now we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this remote control . so , are we going to use l_c_d _ , speech recognition ?", "marketing executive : should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need . and then we can move on to the more advanced features .", "industrial designer : so the available things are l_c_d _ , the buttons and everything . radio frequency depends . and , the recognition it depends on you guys .", "project manager : but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control ?", "project manager : we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button .", "industrial designer : just one note to the chan channel changing . do we will we use only two buttons , or like numbered buttons ? those nine plus one or two ?", "project manager : on the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it is", "project manager : maybe i . maybe we could have key buttons , like discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and", "project manager : if you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you have you plus .", "marketing executive : we could maybe also c incorporate petre is idea of the slider for the volume , with the channel . so we c you could quickly just through many channels .", "industrial designer : so we are still s speaking about the common devices or we are inviting the new one ?", "project manager : what about the settings of the t_v _ ? because it is button we do not use very often , but it is we need it anyway .", "user interface designer : so we do not have any we do not have we should just design the remote control and we sh we do not have any access to the t_v _ design or we can change some design . because one solution for this ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels , some preview of all channels and then you can", "marketing executive : i do not , i do not but i do not think we are the ones . this remote control we are developing is a generic control for all t_v_s , .", "industrial designer : w it would be better to stick to the remote control and not to bother the t_v _ to print these things . it wi it will be still more expensive , but for the l_c_d _ and this is no problem in the price .", "project manager : so , what are we doing with the settings ? because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons , so . maybe with the l_c_d _ we can do something with less buttons , but", "marketing executive : but then you do not want to make the l_c_d _ display too complicated at the same time .", "marketing executive : there is always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , under a cover or at the back of under a slide or some", "industrial designer : we we could have two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode . or like children and grandfather is mode , and the , the user not the user , the man mana t_v _ manager mode .", "marketing executive : so we have five minutes left . so s the settings we th we are agreeing are that they are required . it is just how to a", "project manager : in the menus of the l_c_d _ or in the back of the remote control , like that .", "industrial designer : should should should not we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? because generally", "project manager : it is it is a setting , . it should fit in those settings functions .", "marketing executive : when they say power button they mean to turn the t_v _ on and off .", "marketing executive : but if you are watching t_v _ for two hours , you do not want your t_v _ to turn off after five minute", "industrial designer : you do not need to every five minutes to keep it alive . , so we should keep this button .", "marketing executive : based on our usability studies again , pe people said that the power button was v a very relevant button .", "industrial designer : so we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep the l_c_d _ and all the buttons and ,", "industrial designer : we could make it like a opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the t_v _ and if you close it , it will turn off the t_v _ . if if you like this ,", "marketing executive : we need to concentrate on the , the major usage of the th of the control , which is you sit down , you turn on your t_v _ , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the t_v _ off .", "industrial designer : but since we have the l_c_d _ , we did not need too much button too many buttons . , just the decision of the power button . should we make it a button , or some something which would be", "marketing executive : some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display", "industrial designer : but since we want to control all the televisions , and it would probably be worth to set the timing on the remote , no ? because if the t_v _ turns on itself , it , if the time the timer should be there .", "project manager : if we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display like that , and is it very useful ? , are users wants to have the time on the remote ? this is the question .", "project manager : w in my opinion

"marketing executive : very , very occasionally . but i do use the display of the time quite often , but", "industrial designer : but it can be on the display in a corner all the time on the remote

just need a microphone and the software , so , and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting , so people may be attracted to buy this and it is not very difficult to put a software inside the electronic device and put a microphone . it does not take that much place and also that much it does not cost that much .", "industrial designer : but we should be careful about the battery life ,

diodes , bat batteries and led lights , they are needed and they are everywhere available . , again , it is a fair price . it is a common technology , like i told , the circuit board , it is the most important part of the remote control . , we can use for that fibreglass with copper wires , it is it is can be made as fast as printing paper . it is it is all very , they are making it all the time . , and it is not very specialised technology . i have not come to here , but i have got some images of remote controls . they were not very trendy or just a remote control like everyone knows . so i why i should put it here .", "project manager : but you do not think it is a problem to design the technical part of the remote control ? it is gonna be easy ?", "project manager : r regardless of

more clear when we come to the u some of the new requirements .", "user interface designer : there are l at least basic functions , like just th the channels one till nine , on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button like that . , most standard have volume , and a mute function , and , the next and previous channel . that is just basic what we need .", "user interface designer : and

designer : ? , that is all i have to say , . , that was it .", "marketing executive : . it is alright . alright , i have done some research for functional requirements . the working method there were hundred w h one hundred people , how do you say , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also filled out a questionnaire with a few questions . , i have lined them up here . , ask whether common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and like that . i have found some interesting things . we do we do got a market . , three out of four people claim m to find remote controls ugly . so if we make a trendy design , we have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . , three out of four users zaps a lot , as i quoted here from the results . zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . that is quite a lot . relevant options are , power buttons . although , only used once per hour . , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and very much used . furthermore , fifty percent says they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . that does not say we got we can leave ninety percent off . but it says we should not make it too complicated . fifty percent also claims to have lost a remote control very often in the room . and an important thing here , the most important customers , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . and elderly people , our market , are less interested in features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . so , what i was thinking , wrong side . we should not implement too much features on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . group features for a higher usability , what i was claiming in the previous meeting . , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them on one button and make them accessible in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and , it there are a lot of options there , so we can really make , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there . and , if you want to implement v_c_r _ and d_v_d _ options , group them in the button , not too small buttons , so they wo not be very , how do you say", "marketing executive : yes , wo not be very present , and a trendy look , although seventy percent of the market is consists of elderly people who do not really care for trendy looks or whatever , i it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . that was what i found .", "project manager : then we i am gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on what features we find

is impossible , .", "project manager : so the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , like on and off , and do not make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or", "project manager : it is just you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much . so we have to think of that . the remote control should only be used for television . otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t ma the time to market . so maybe we should leave all d_v_d _ and v_c_r _ related features off completely . that that is what they are trying to say . , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . new products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . so you talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested . but , they are not relevant because we are aiming at a younger", "marketing executive : i do not really agree actually , to be honest . it is a very small market which we will approach then if we want to reach customers younger than forty . it is only like thirty percent of the total market .",

the older people , but we also want , a new customer group . that is the one we have not covered yet . so that is what the problem is . we have not got remote controls for", "project manager : no , but we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . so maybe we can make a remote control that is primarily interesting for the younger group , but is not that bad for an older person either . , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . our product is corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . , something else to know .", "project manager : let is go back to the agenda . so we have now had to the three presentations . we know about the new project requirements . that means we can d , discuss on the remote control functions . ,

forty , not older than forty , maybe that is not very , we do not really need to have a simple remote control . we can implement more functions then , because the younger people are more able to adapt

a simpler design , and no other s functions than just t_v _ , but they s do aim at a younger , ma", "user interface designer : but you sai you said that a lot of functions are not used . so why should

twenty five euros .", "marketing executive : ye the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not a rare combination .", "project manager : nah . , that is true . but

like make a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise . that is probably stupid , but as i found here , fifty percent , was it fifty ?", "project manager : but when you when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it", "project manager : and then also you do not even need batteries , because you can make it chargeable .", "project manager : that w , but , the pro no , that it might be t p , nee but we do not .", "project manager : maybe you , but we much about production cost , but when you can imagine that when you spend twenty five euros on a remote

not gonna be that expen", "project manager : s some be i have never seen that before , and you make it be , you see it with the mo the mouses nowadays .", "project manager : i it is really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem .", "industrial designer : but but remote controls nowadays can last two years , three years , with t two batteries .", "project manager : maybe

executive : on the other hand , if you do not do it , we can also make a bay . , it looks trendy and still put a bleep function in it , but the bay is definitely", "project manager : it is a good idea . and make it , we it is it is not a most costly remote control . we can save on the functions . we just put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make s there is some noise that it can make , or probably some cheap light thing around it or that it lights up ,", "project manager : it is also . and if you put it away , it is w we have to we that is it is not a easy market . we have to something special . and for twenty five euros people want something remote c special from your mote control , and we ca not deliver that in r with regards to the functions ,",

concerning the costs , and if it is possible we will do that . and we even try to save up on other to make we can do such a thing . and the first thing we the most likeable thing to n to skip is then probably the recharge function . if that is too expensive , we wo not do that .", "project manager : it is the idea . i know that batteries last long nowadays . and and what people just think about , i will never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it is very annoying when your battery is empty . and then when you have not batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo i

are not very motivated to do something about it .", "project manager : then it beeps all the time and . you do not want to have ever have those problems , and you wo not have if you have the

that is a great idea , i am gonna use it . and when it , when time goes by and they think , i will never put him in the recharger , last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now

there is a closing sheet . we have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work . , i will make i will i had some problems with the digitising the first minutes , the s the next

first off we will just recap from our last meeting . which was we got together just to decide on to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , and who we all are and like that , get bit more of an idea together of what is going on . what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we it is that we are doing , now we know that it is a t_v _ remote and you guys have just been off doing some r _ and d _ for that , that is research and development for those that have not heard that before ,", "project manager : see i am learning all sorts of new technologi terms in

like to hear who is g who is on the from catherine actually first . i want what i would like to hear about is if we have finally decided on what energy we are gonna be using and", "industrial designer : so that is me again . so for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used in the fifties for torches , if you remember that which would not be v", "industrial designer : . it would not be very fancy . you can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . so if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work . or you can use solar cells , but i am not about that indoors , really , but", "user interface designer : there is sometimes combinations , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power .", "project manager : do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ? does anybody know ?", "industrial designer : think the what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . and if we want something fancier , the kinetic provision of energy could be , but i if it is worth the cost . so we have got to discuss that .", "industrial designer : for the case of the remotes itself , they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . you can have a curved one or a double curved one , if what , so", "industrial designer : more ergonomic , that suits the palm of your hand , that thing . so then the case material itself , so it can be either plastic or latex , rubber , wood , or titanium . and th for each of them you have cases where titanium , you ca not use it for if you if we are choosing a double curved case , we ca not choose titanium . and if we are choosing solar cells then we ca not choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . but if we are choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . and we discussed earlier on the r _ s _ i _ problem thing , so we could", "project manager : so that might be an idea of using the rubber , but then it should ,", "project manager : when a t_v _ programme is got one watching the match and your team is just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it will bounce off the wall back at you . , i like that idea .", "project manager : rubber , we are all going we are all liking that idea ? you think you can market that ?", "industrial designer : and then there are the push - buttons , so you can have basic push - buttons or a scroll - wheels , like you have on a mouse , or you could have l_c_d _ , which gives you a display . scroll buttons , as . so if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push - buttons . so if we are going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push - buttons .", "project manager : we are gonna go with we have decided that it is gonna be a rubber case so", "industrial designer : so it is a constraint . , but is it a double curved one or not ? if it is not a double curved , then we have got the choice for the push - buttons , if it is a double curve , we have got ta go for rubber push - buttons . if that makes sense .", "user interface designer : if it is rubber , is not it malleable anyway , it does not matter if it is double is not a rubber case , mean it is completely flexed , it flexes to whatever they want it to ? mean so what is the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ?", "industrial designer : no , but na le you see , you have got , the energy that is one thing ,", "industrial designer : then you have the case is , whether it is flat or curved . and that is we do not care if it is rub rubber or not , but then we have decided that we going for rubber for the case material . so if we have chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it is flat , single curved or double curved . and i am just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go why , but we need to go for rubber push - buttons . so , either we just need to decide on the case .", "industrial designer : let is go crazy . and then , do i have a last slide ? so the push - buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that is just the electronics between the but behind the push - buttons . and the price that go with it , so the simple push - buttons are gonna be the cheapest . if we get a scroll - wheel , that is a higher price range . if we get an advanced chip which is used for the l_c_d _ , the display thing , then that is even more expensive .", "project manager : simple , . chip on print . , what i am not understanding here is , advanced chip on print , which i presume is like one p_c_b _ and that is got all the electronics on one board including the infra - red sender ?", "project manager : right . what a what alternatives do we have to that ? y what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ?", "industrial designer : if it is not chip on print then , i , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and does not include the infra - red . it is less expensive", "industrial designer : technically speaking , it is not as advanced , but it does the job , too .", "project manager : so , why would we not go for that ? if it is something that is inside the unit . i it does not affects whether the customer is gonna buy it or not .", "industrial designer : it would be it would be , but they are saying they have just developed it ,", "industrial designer : i am just guessing . but it is gonna be the most expensive option , probably and", "user interface designer : th the speech recognition option is it does not seem really very promising for us ,", "user interface designer : the the example that they are already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , you can program a sample wi that when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as . just clips of tha that you record yourself . so you can program your coffee - maker that

turns the t_v _ on like , turn the t_v _ on , and i turns comes on , but it is not that . it just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response .", "user interface designer : so , , like what is the point of saying , hello remote , hello , how are you ?", "industrial designer : so i will go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . so for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the", "project manager : basic battery . it is cheap , it is cheerful , it is worked , does work .", "industrial designer : cheaper option . are you happy with that ? so we will go for the battery . then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ?", "project manager : we were go we were going with the late with the r_s_i _ rubber , were not we ?", "industrial designer : so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push - buttons ,", "project manager : and it is cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it", "project manager : as i we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that the people have the r _ people were getting the complaining about r_s_i _ , and this is anti - r_s_i _ . so that is another marketing point that we can use .", "project manager : but anything is gonna have buttons . even if it is a jog wheel , it is still repetitive

the v it is the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement . it is not actually what you are doing . but the fact that this rubber i is actually used in these anti - r_s_i _ ps specific", "project manager : and , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at your children .", "project manager : gabriel . let is let is hear from you about the it is the interface .", "user interface designer : alright . , some of what i have to say ties into what catherine was just talking about .", "user interface designer : so i am continuing with the user interface topic . and so i consulted with our manufacturing division . it sounded like catherine was also speaking with them . i also took reissa is marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration , that is crucial as far as what keys we are going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and how they are laid out . and so the manufacturing division sent some samples of interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , like the coffee machine . so i already mentioned the speech recognition interface . i , we vetoed that idea . it is it is pointless . it is just a sample sensor sample output . it would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the t_v _ . so , they also give the they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an m_p _ three player like ipod . so we have already addressed that and that would actually be worse for something like r_s_i _ you got that thumb movement that you are constantly doing . the other suggestion ,", "user interface designer : and i have a feeling that we are interested in something more general , but they suggested , going i a little bit into a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours , the keys might be , funny or ,", "user interface designer : for the elderly , where the remote is very large and the buttons are very large and there is only a few buttons . but we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done . so , the key layout and design are really crucial . you do not want you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without always pressing the wrong one . and i did not mention that we need a power button in our last give you an example here of , good layout and bad layout from our manufacturing department . so this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a v _ on both of them , so it is confusing for the user . this is the example of the giant remote that is impossible to lose .", "user interface designer : and for something for kids . and so , i th my personal preferences of we have all talked about and seemed to be on the same page . so i was against the speech recognition and against going towards anything in a niche sense . it should be more general . i did not think the spinning - wheel or the l_c _ display were crucial for us . and , that is it for me .", "project manager : let is so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? the the interface type we are going for", "user interface designer : so , it is just gonna be push - buttons . we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . and some it will either have a lock button like we mentioned or a cover like that . i it is to the point where we need to decide about that .", "project manager : are we gonna hav an are we d have we decided on whether w we are gonna s supplement it with anything , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we are not we are just gonna go for something", "user interface designer : but , i would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like a black with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the r_r _ can be yellow , like that .", "project manager : . , i do not have any other questions on this . let is move over to", "user interface designer : i the fact also that we are having a rubber case would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before .", "user interface designer : s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . but that should be , speak with the button department , but that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents the other buttons from operating .", "marketing executive : right . , i am just letting what is happening in the markets and what the fashions are for next year . so yes , so from looking at this year is trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we have done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to which we have already probably discussed . the most important aspect is look and feel . so the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have . so it has to be", "project manager : why should people buy this when they are already got a remote that came with the t_v _ ?", "project manager : now the trouble is we have already decided that we are going with the that works already , that is cheap .", "user interface designer : actually , these first two points we have already gone away from , our rubber one is not fancy it is different , but i would not say like a rubber remote is fancy . if that is what people want then we maybe we are going in the wrong direction . and it is not technologically innovative either .", "marketing executive : so , no loose that is why i was thinking , bluetooth , if you like put up bluetooth , and it is like a bluetooth remote control , everybody is gonna like , bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , like people and when it comes to marketing like that is what people go for , they do not really care whether , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not .", "project manager : one hundred per cent , that is your first thing , you go , i am not gonna buy that , if it works or not .", "marketing executive : but it looks good . if it looks good and it is it can just be there for decoration .", "project manager : and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television .", "project manager : it would that would mean you would need a television that has bluetooth in it , which no television does ,", "marketing executive : if you are looking at if you looking at something that is going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art .", "industrial designer : bluetooth would , enable you , to connect you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs , you would get on your television you are being called by this person right now . things like that .", "industrial designer : no , but if you get bluetooth on the remote , you would be able to", "industrial designer : i with the television , . i was just trying to find an advantage . wha what w what advantage would you get for the", "marketing executive : like it does not have to be , bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , is new . whether it is a battery it could be something really minor , like but we are really keeping to what is already out there , and peoplehave already seen it , peoplehave already got it . if we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have and just go creative .", "industrial designer : maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . it is been done for watches , but i have not seen that for remotes , yet .", "project manager : and and this is all tying in very nicely . the fact that it is made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it .", "user interface designer : we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the generating like the energy generator .", "marketing executive : and we have all worked that out . , in the fashion , how it is supposed to look . next year is fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . so next year people will be buying , i found this really funny , strawberry shaped chairs ,", "user interface designer : so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a and an avocado key on them .", "marketing executive : rubber things . and as it is rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , so it is not quite spongy , but spongy , i would say is", "marketing executive : so we are in . and so personal what i was just saying like move away from the current remote controls like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company is image , . i had to say", "project manager : alright , no , this i this is good , so through all that we have we go we are right , we are gonna go back to going with the kinetic thing ,", "project manager : that is great , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti - r_s_i _ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries , and i am not about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though .", "user interface designer : i how we incorporate we do not have to follow every trend , i .", "project manager : it seems like the only thing that we have not really finally on is its image . like , we are saying no we do not want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , or like are we going it looks slick , but what do we mean by slick thing ?", "marketing executive : different . , it is it should be , what do you associate with rubber ? like", "marketing executive : really different colours . , sor i , i used the wrong word , what do you associate with the mate the material that material ? like i am just thinking bright colours . bright natural colours , nothing too", "marketing executive : bright , but too not like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like", "project manager : like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the channel buttons should be one colour and like that , do you mean ?", "user interface designer : the one thing i am wondering about , i hope that we are not going like too much down a gimmicky road of having", "user interface designer : if somebody go goes into the store they are gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato remote .", "marketing executive : say in this country , you will get , lots of people wanting something really funky and . like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , mummy i wanna buy that one . and parents will see the pro as , because it is like kids wo not break it , it is not breakable if you throw it around . especially with younger kids , they can pick it up and the only thing is that really small kids might chew on it , but", "marketing executive : so it is rea it is quite like user friendly and also for different families , like family use as , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , . especially maybe younger girls if it is in pink they will be like pink remote control for their room something .", "project manager : so , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the", "marketing executive : so like you walk in , you are like , i like that remote control , because it is so bright , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , what colour would you like ? and then they go like , choose the colour . so it puts , even the customer into more control over what they are buying instead of , you have got all colour it is either that or nothing . so they also get to pick . , personally i like walking into a shop and choosing a colour .", "user interface designer : where , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they are customising it when they buy it , even , just by the fact of choosing .", "industrial designer : there are some colours that i wouldn i would never choose , and i would be curious how many people choose that colour .", "project manager : that is that can be down to bit of market researching , if that is easy enough to find out what colours are more popular .", "project manager : . , we will alright let is what we are gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then is from you catherine wi your y you are gonna be working on the look and feel design . gabriel , you are gonna be working on , come up with the user interface design . then , you two are gonna be working together on this . you wo not be going off to your separate offices .", "project manager : it is gonna , come up ki , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some i some physical ideas . at the moment , it is hard . we were kinda going , it is got ta feel , it is got ta look and that it is", "project manager : and i will be talking to the bosses , and f fielding off some more spam and", "project manager : that is it really . keeping things t , ho hopefully keeping things together . , that is this is this is good . so we know for definite we know we have now got some definite things going on . we definitely know how it is powered , we definitely know that it is gonna be a simple buttons , we are not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things , so we have we are keeping the costs down . it is this rubber casing that we can sell as fun and funky . of any other remote controls that are made out of this . people , people are saying , standard gives you repetitive strain injury , this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite , it is supposed to fix it rather than it . , we are gonna we we are gonna as a extra something on it , what extra things are there extra things this product have ? we will look into this lock key facility , although whether or not it happens , or is possible

twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes . so first of all the functional design objectives . we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ,

executive : alright . so we are just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked . i real reaction did some market research . they had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch t_v _ and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had . what they found was they analysed people is desires and needs . focusing on their desires , people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly , seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote . i anything beyond what fancy means , but that is particularly of use to us , . also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions . people also had certain frustrations , that we could try to take into consideration with our design . that being people k frustrated with losing their remotes . , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that was their biggest frustration . people are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and that ties back to what you were saying before just that there is too many buttons , it just needs to be easy to use . it also mentioned something called r_s_i _ and i was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what r_s_i _ is ,", "marketing executive : people do not like that . so i the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , the repetitive use , i , caused a strain . looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people is remotes are not matching their operating behaviour . people are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote . and what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume . people also zap like to change the channel , about sixty five per cent during an hour of use . so we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , because they are used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what is going on . so that some things that we might wanna think about , the idea of an l_c_d _ screen was brought up although they did not have any details on what people is preferences on that were , so know if that is coming to me later , like that . but something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use , make that , something like an audio setting is not given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that is used a lot more often . and in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , that it has a fancy appeal and that it is not ugly and that it feels like the way they are gonna use it , so it does not give them any hand injuries or things like that .", "project manager : very much . that was that was great . is move on to the next presentation on effects .", "marketing executive : and that is in the shared , if i did it right , if anyone wants to look at it .", "user interface designer : here we go . right so i am gonna talk about the technical functions design of the remote control . we need to start by considering what a remote control actually is . it is a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , so i it is a communication device . we we tell the remote control what we want to do , it sends a message to the television saying change the channel , change the volume , adjust these settings , adjust the brightness . how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control ? first thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . we need to our final product is gonna be like , so we need a clear idea of exactly what this product does , how it works , and what the end - user is gonna want from this product . , a way i would suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , and then trying to get some feedback about h how these particular prototypes work , sorta find out what people think of 'em . using a remote control is quite a subjective experience . , and different people prefer different things . we should remember that remote controls are a fairly standard piece of equipment . when a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places . so in some sense we are gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design so that we are not completely shocking people . but within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas and to make something that is perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out . also in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities . the first of these is technological ye what can we do with the current state of technology as it is . the second is economic , we need to find a balance between features and price . so as you mentioned things like voice recognition would add to the price but it would also i m improve the design of the product . i had a look on the web to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . in analysing these we can consider what things what is good about them , what things do they get right , what is bad about them , what is wrong with 'em , how we can improve on the designs that i found and what can we do to make our product stand out from the large majority of remote controls . here is two examples probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum . on the left here we have got an engineering - based design for a remote control , so it is one that is got lots of buttons , it is fully featured , everything you might possibly want to do is there , it is got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , freeze frame . it is fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , but once you have learned it you can do whatever you want with your t_v _ . the one on the right is a lot more basic . it is just got the essential functions of the t_v _ changing the channel , play , stop , volume . it would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , but again th it is swings and roundabouts . there are disadvantages , you ca not use it say to freeze the television picture . there is a lot of features that are missing from that remote control . so we have got to find our find a way of striking a balance between the two . as i said before , remote controls are subjective , different people want different things . personally wa what i want from a remote control is a device that is simple , it is easy to use , it is got big buttons for doing the things i do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel . it it does everything that i need it to , as i said before , i am quite lazy , i do not wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television . i also want something that looks , and that feels good , that is ergonomically designed .", "project manager : that was very useful . it is funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes . and neither of them were very pretty , ?", "user interface designer : there is certainly a market for technology that looks . and that is why companies like applehave ' ve made a lot of progress .", "industrial designer : right , i really ca not see what i am doing , so does anyone have a", "marketing executive : so , did it let you go on the internet or was that just what it let you see ?", "marketing executive : i was like googling and then i am like it wo not let me google .", "project manager : the it is right above draw . there are three thingy if it is way at the bottom . under three icons and it is the one that looks like a desk . there are y_s .", "industrial designer : . so this is our working design presentation . i had a bit of some issues with this , because i was not able to find everything i needed , but i that is we are still in early stages . so , this is this . though th the thing about working design is the what we are trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function . one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder . it works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out , and then you get coffee at the end that is and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work . if i am explaining that very , but how do i get to the next s so h the method as working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function , what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done . wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen . so you make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function . and then the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately .", "industrial designer : the findings that i got very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra - red is the best way to do that you do not need a sight line . so that is one thing we are gonna work on . the user interface is critical here , because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data , which then goes through the infra - red , so the chip that ian is designing , is gonna be crucial . and really it all comes down to the user , because they are the one that is controlling most of the working design . the components that we find here are the energy source , the battery or whatever that is gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that is controlling the chip , and the infra - red bulb that is gonna let us move the data to the receiver . so you have four main components and they are designed like this . you have your energy source right there which then brings energy or information to the chip , which is also controlled by the users . you have energy going to the user who is controlling the chip is not what i wanted to do .", "industrial designer : w , . do not show me that tip again .", "industrial designer : there we are . about this , guys . i am pathetic with things like this . so you have your energy source , your user interface who is controlling the chip , the chip also uses the energy , and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra - red bulb , which will then bring the data to the receiver . hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my garbled way .", "industrial designer : this is the parts of the working design that need to be figured out . and personal preferences , besides the fact that i ca not spell , we need a long - lasting energy source , people do not wanna be changing it a lot . we need a chip that works with the user interface , that is not too complicated . we need a straightforward interface , like ian was saying , simple , not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra - red signal , so that you are not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands . so that is it for the working design .", "project manager : yes , . never tell which way to turn these things . lefty loosey , righty tighty , right ?", "project manager : i have nothing on my screen .", "project manager : requirements . we have a couple new requirements that i was just e - mailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in mind as we are creating this . we did not bring it up yet , or in the meetings so far , but we are not gonna work with teletext because it that is been taken over by the internet , so we are not gonna worry about that .", "user interface designer : i did not realise . it is like a i suppose it is similar to a very basic web browser . you have like you have numbers on your remote control , y and you type in the page number you want , so like you type a hundred on your remote control and this index appears on the television screen with just some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it . and you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information , mostly rather boring like what is on t_v _ next and share prices and that thing .", "industrial designer : but if you ever see the t_v _ saying like go to page one sixty on ceefax now , that is what they are talking about .", "project manager : interesting . , we are not gonna the management has decided we are not gonna work with that . and we are also gonna w like your question earlier whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera . just for television . that is what we are focused on .", "project manager : otherwise becomes to complex , we wanna get this out very quickly . we only have a short amount of time . and finally there is more marketing , , our corporate image has to be recognisable . while we are gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design .", "user interface designer : so what is our corporate image like ? it is yellow colour with we put fashion in electronics .", "project manager : looks like , a yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the r_s in", "project manager :  . but it is , so we got ta keep that in mind .", "project manager : or ha maybe some buttons could be yellow . like , we can play around with it a little bit . , we need to talk about our functions and our target group . we need to decide who our target group is . you in your analysis of different market of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences , that older people did not really care for voice recognition , but younger people did . and so who are we aiming this at ?", "industrial designer : if we are gonna say that function fashion we put the fashion in electronics then you automatically , a younger group that is who is gonna be attracted to this .", "marketing executive : yes , i do think , who is gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ?", "project manager : it is gonna be twenty five euro remember , so it has to be avai marketable to whomever it is .", "user interface designer : is it is it something that is gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes w with a television ? that would affect the way that we market it .", "project manager : at least right now what we are doing is deciding on just the remote itself , so it will probably be sold separately , twenty five euro by itself .", "marketing executive : the only break - down that i was given in terms of age was the voice activation and there is a big jump , after thirty five people do not really care if it has voice , so it is like fifteen to thirty five that think that is a good idea . i am gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later , but if that is the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range .", "industrial designer : that is probably a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , so that might be a fairly good target group for us .", "project manager : now , those are that is all specific for speech recognition . are we gonna use that as one of our functions ?", "user interface designer : i would say no , because it is gonna add too much to the price . especially if we are marketing it as a separate product , people are gonna be paying , we have got a price limit of was it twelve and a half euros for to produce it ?", "user interface designer : and i wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many other compromises .", "marketing executive : but what else are we gonna put , not that i am really gung - ho about it , i what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though . so like other than just making it look good , how is it can look really great and still have the same up - n - down buttons", "industrial designer : but why are we aiming for a technological advancement ? everything we are talking about is ease of use and simple and that does not necessarily mean more technology ,", "industrial designer : it could use it could mean , not . if they might be overwhelmed with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology .", "marketing executive : if someone is looking to buy a new remote , do not they want like an upgrade ?", "project manager : upgrade ? we can look for we can look at upgrade or we can look at user - friendly .", "industrial designer : that came with their t_v _ that is just impossible to use , or maybe it broke , or maybe they are just missing it .", "project manager : and we also need to talk about if we are only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or", "marketing executive : can you like this may be too complicated , but , i wish i had something to explain it , like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , and like you got the rest the buttons , but the rest of them like went in .", "user interface designer : there are remote controls like that , like some t_v_s they have a sliding screen on the remote control of it that hides all the complicated buttons . so if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re - tune it , then you open up this little hatch or slide the screen down and there is all the special buttons .", "marketing executive : then is like people who do not wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just do not even read it then you will never even know that those things can pull out . and you are a happy person and everyone else does not have to have like two remotes , one that has the easy ones and one that has", "project manager : we have to be careful that does not impede the chip transmitting information , but that is gonna be mostly technological thing .", "project manager : those are very good goals , that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do . simplicity and fashion and , or usability speci however you wanna say that , which includes an emphasis on making the infra - red very functional , so that you do not have to travel around a lot .", "marketing executive : what can you do to like make the infra - red more functional , like why would it not be ? i am just wondering .", "industrial designer : the battery and that the chip takes the data and presents it , without scattering .", "industrial designer : . the quality of all the components really , we ca not really do anything shoddy work , it is gonna be visible down the line .", "project manager : s voice recognition , which i feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control ,", "project manager : like it might be necessary for a t_v _ but not for the remote c , .", "project manager : seems a little bit  . , and it might be too expensive .", "marketing executive : and if the whole idea is you are using a remote then why would you have voice , like what and then it is like you would not need a remote you would just talk to your t_v _ .", "user interface designer : it is for , like , the ultimately lazy people , who ca not even be bothered to pick up the remote .", "marketing executive : maybe if i get m more numbers , i will e - mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages . but this does not divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also , which is not , really is not that representative , especially if it is a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there is very few in each age group ,", "project manager : under sixty five , that is a good start . i would say we are can we narrow it down to maybe teenagers and families ? that would go up to like fifty ?", "user interface designer : the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages . , we said simplicity is one of the features , so it is going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , and that might be older people , but then we have also got fashion , which is something that definitely appeals to younger people .", "marketing executive : maybe we do not have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age ,", "marketing executive : maybe we can define it by like the demographic of like h t how much money they have to spend like that ,", "marketing executive : it has to be someone who owns a television , and like how recently have they bought their television like that thing .", "project manager : so maybe it is more useful to d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is", "project manager : because , things so different will appeal to different people , but there are a couple functions do we want something so that do we want some thing to find it if it is lost ? like a button on a t_v _ you can press and it will ring , i like or beep ?", "marketing executive : h like i said before , fifty per cent of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it . and if we are talking about making something easy that goes along with it so it would not be like a random thing to add in . it would be relevant to like the overall goal ,", "project manager : we have to we have about four minutes left to define our functions . so let is do that quickly . so we want something to keep it from getting lost . and we want large buttons for the essential things . large , accessible buttons for the essentials . we want a possibility to get the extra functions .", "user interface designer : which are hidden away in some way or not hidden but they are not as prominent as the main features .", "project manager : hidden way . and we also want it to be fashionable , which i am not if that is a function so much as a", "marketing executive : on your coffee table , it is not like an eye sore , that thing .", "project manager : do it . any other essential functions that we need ? do we need a long - life battery ?", "industrial designer : battery battery use . but that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really .", "user interface designer : we should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery . i suspect the remote control does need a battery ,", "industrial designer : it it does . i do not think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without one .", "industrial designer : but you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your ipod .", "industrial designer : so you do not ha you got like a rechargeable battery . that might contribute to less people losing it too if it stays in one place .", "project manager : we have to think about space in living - rooms , too , like they are , would you put it on top of the t_v _ ? i , just think that is a good idea , we will keep it . think it is", "project manager : and maybe fun . we are gonna conclude now , has everyone said their functions after the meeting we are gonna each complete a sks a questionnaire and a summaries summary . i what summarisation . and then we will have our lunch break . after that we have thirty minutes of individual work . i will make to put up the minutes and the project documentation and including these powerpoint slides . if everyone could do that as , that would be great . you each have individual actions , i _ i_d _ industrial design you have your components concept , user interface , the user interface concept , market trend wa watching . and as per last time you will get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e - mailed to you . and hopefully , i hope , next time you will be able to access more of the web site that they seem to tell you that you could . it is kinda frustrating ,", "project manager : be to note any frustrations or any issues that come up in your summary .", "marketing executive : it is good . did you were you able to like put yours in the group folder ?", "project manager : looks like there are looks like there is a second one mine that is that i did not do , it is from like an earlier project , so", "industrial designer : in there we have technical functions presentation , working design presentation and the functional requirements . at least that is what i have in .", "marketing executive : no , but that is yours is in the e - mail separate , like it is not on the server .", "marketing executive : but if i open it and then save it , probably will be there ."], "sent_ids": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
