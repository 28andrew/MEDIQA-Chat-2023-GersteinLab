{"article_id": "107", "text": ["project manager : lovely to see you all again . it is our conceptual design meeting and it is starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we will go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we are gonna do an opening , i am gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we will have your three presentations and then we will have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we will close . these are our minutes from r the functional design . we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it is for all age groups , different functions of it . our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . and s in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding piece and a long - life battery or a charging station . , now three presentations . i would like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching .", "industrial designer : i am very excited by this one actually guys i had a lot of fun doing it . components design . this is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of . so , we need to examine each element separately , but we are designing a full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . the main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . these are all things that we had addressed before , but i am gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like . the case , the options that i have gotten from headquarters about what we can do , there is the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double - curved case . i have not seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic . that would be our case . buttons , for buttons we have pushbuttons , which is what real reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels , which can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high - tech and have an l _ l_c_d _ screen . circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are . and then battery is where things get most exciting . we are talking about long - life batteries here . we can have your basic double a _ batteries , but we also have these options of using a kinetic battery , like are used in high - tech watches , where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up . so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . or a solar battery , although there are slight complications with solar batteries as in we ca not use a latex case if we have a solar battery . they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . not quite what that is , but that is the description that i received , so that is what i am passing on to you . so those are our options . personal preferences that i was thinking through here is what we have been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . so if we are going for fashion in our cases , that what we are gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double - curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . maybe titanium , maybe some wood . we are gonna have to investigate that better when i get specifics of the actual materials , but that is what i have in mind . and we wanna go for simplicity . probably pushbuttons , but i am intrigued by the idea of a scroll wheel , if anyone has anything any ideas on that ? i know the ipods and things right now have touch scroll buttons which are exactly like what they are describing , so that might be something we wanna look into . and i am really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery . solar i do not think would be such a good idea , because how often are you that your remote control will get a certain amount of light . but this idea of the kinetic , that you do not have to replace , and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , that m would be a very interesting thing . but we would also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down . we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we are gonna start using an l_c_d _ . so we want to be aware of not making things overly t technological if they do not need to be , that will keep our manufacturing price way down . that is what i have for options . i would appreciate anyone is input , but that is what i am seeing for the future of the look of this thing .", "marketing executive : and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical - ish looking thing ,", "industrial designer : i know if we do have a double - curved case , it ca not have any titanium in it . but the titanium , they were quite they are marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme , so that could be quite interesting . space - age remote .", "industrial designer : just all things to keep in mind . that is about all i have to do , guys . i hope i did not go through that too quickly .", "industrial designer : no idea , no idea . i am assuming that a kinetic battery is not gonna take up that much weight , and that a tita titanium is very light , i know , but other than that is really basic , that is all i have gotten so far . any other questions ?", "industrial designer : no ? i have save this in the shared projects , if anyone wants to look", "industrial designer : and i have c considerable notes on the topic as , if anyone needs any more information .", "project manager : if you made notes yourself you can put those on our underneath our , in your book ,", "industrial designer : but if anyone has any specific questions , do not hesitate to email me . i", "project manager : now we are concepts of user interface . this one is so much tighter than the other one .", "user interface designer : alright , so i am gonna describe the concept of the user interface of this des device . we have talked about the two essential properties of the user interface . we want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable . other we have also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose . we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make that we include that we have included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people . we have a number of different choices for a design concept and s that is something that i will show you some examples of , but essentially we need to choose how is this device going to work , how what model is there going to be for user interaction with this device . once we have chosen a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making that we get all the essential functions in the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features . and we also have to make it look . so , that is what we do not want . m we do not want lots of buttons , complicated features . we want something that looks and simple . here is a fairly simple device . this is an ipod from apple . the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons . it is very minimalistic in its design . you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small l_c_d _ screen . the thing i like about this is that it is very quick to access the main features . you can just about make out that the button three buttons are previous track , next track and play pause . they are the main features of the ipod , the things you will use a all the time . then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the l_c_d _ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and find the more advanced features that you want . so that is a good model that we could have . here is a another example . this is it is an interesting idea and i it looks pretty . it is certainly got novelty value . it is and colourful , it is and bright . it is also something that you can feel your way around . the buttons are different shapes and you can if you are watching t_v _ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button is which and , it is ith it is fun . so i like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often . so you would need a few buttons to select your favourite channels . most people , when they watch t_v _ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their t_v _ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most . you have buttons for your favourite channel , changing the volume , which is something you do all the time when you are watching t_v _ , and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored . other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the t_v _ , i what else you do with a t_v _ . but these are all necessary functions . you ca not have a t there is no point having a television that you ca not tune or that you ca not set the contrast , so we need to find a way of including these somehow . and one other suggestions i would make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the ipod . we would either have a small l_c_d _ display on the device itself , or have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device . and that would allow you to access the advanced features whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often .", "user interface designer : that is one way to go , yes . there are advantages and disadvantages if you have an l_c_d _ display , it is , because it is it lets you just sit there and st and control your television from your armchair .", "user interface designer : there are disadvantages , an l_c_d _ display would have to be quite small , we are i", "user interface designer : we are i assume we are gonna be making quite a small device . it would also have to have a backlighting in it , you ten you tend to watch t_v _ in the dark ,", "user interface designer : but you need to be able to see your l_d_d _ l_c_d _ display . the alternative is to have a an on - screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . a bit like how they have these digital boxes where you press the buttons and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what is on each channel . that is also a good idea . it is it can it does have it is problems as , if you have got a small t_v _ and you are sitting on the other side of a room , it is hard to read the little text that comes up . but that is a design decision that we can make .", "project manager : i do think that one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what is on . and so like favourite channels is applicable , but th that you do need to have some function where it is you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it .", "project manager : if it was a l _ l_c_d _ on th on the remote , i that you could f that you would be able to see a", "industrial designer : no , we are talking menu like contrast and tuning the v_c_r _ if i have understood you correctly , rather than menu as what is on .", "user interface designer : but it is something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control the c communication is one way ,", "user interface designer : so you ca not have the televisions and information back to the remote control , at least i do not think you can .", "marketing executive : five ? keep pressing lots of 'em . i how relevant all of this gonna be . if anything , the that they gave me .", "marketing executive : so we are gonna look a little bit at trend watching . , i was given an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in paris and milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year . so first they had people they ranked the important aspects of r remote controls , and right now i d they are saying that currently there is a functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it that is gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , so that just goes back to the whole desire of our c real reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so , even though we are stressing , when we are talking , we have all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they are wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it is fancy look and feel . and as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , so just to take that weight into account . the second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations . that would be like if we use something like the space material or the l_c_d _ screen , things like that . and then ease of use was the third most important , whi so really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this . i how much we agree with that . and then the fashion watch talks about that this year is top trend for clothes , shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there is a preference for spongy , tight material .", "marketing executive : and so that brings us to my personal preferences . who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding . personally , i do not really think that i want one that is gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , in a year , so even though this is coming from us as , trend watch , market research , i how much of it we necessarily wanna take away . also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by real reaction , i am a little hesitant as to like , how these questions may have been worded , and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking . personally , like i might reverse it , but if we are working for this company then i no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most . but it does not necessarily need to be a spongy material .", "marketing executive : i do not have a lot of notes to share if you want them , that sums it up .", "project manager : do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? how to use a fruit or vegetable or the spongy material ? could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? it would be easier on the hands .", "project manager : we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that ,", "industrial designer : an i if th my understanding of a latex case is that it is hard to protect inside , but that it is covered with the latex , which is spongier and softer on your hands . it is there is something to be said , we got that thing earlier from you about not wanting it to r _ repetitive stress injuries and things and", "marketing executive : i and i am envisioning more like , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle , so that it does not hurt when you are sitting down for a long time , like i am imagining that thing , i what th that material is called .", "industrial designer : that given the list of materials i w i was forwarded it is that seems doable . could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? we could colour - co - ordinate them ,", "user interface designer : i is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? like , like carrots .", "marketing executive : what about the idea of like a round remote ? instead of like a vertical up and down one . like in terms of holding it . like that is a f shape of a fruit .", "user interface designer : depends . when you when you use a remote , do you press the buttons with your thumb , usually ? or your fingers ?", "user interface designer : or maybe you want something that is shaped like a mobile phone , so you hold it in one hand , and you press the buttons with your thumb .", "user interface designer : but if you have only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it is not so much a problem , perhaps .", "industrial designer : when i am when i am pressing buttons on my ipod , that is how i do it , hold it and press the four .", "industrial designer : or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel .", "user interface designer : the button on an ipod , is it what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing ?", "project manager : the one i have does not have the four on i like around it , i do not think .", "industrial designer : but you had one of the in - between ones , when they were not doing that anymore . ts and you press the centre button ,", "marketing executive : why it would be good for us is like you could have the same wheel effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things ,", "marketing executive : but then how you could go back to the menu and like , if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual t_v _ . i am wanting to say on the t_v _ , if you are changing the brightness , do not you wanna see it happening , ? and then you could still have that available .", "industrial designer : an l_c_d _ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice .", "user interface designer : it could be difficult in practice , also z , you would be z looking down at the l_c_d _ screen , than back up at your t_v _", "project manager : so i am gonna continue with my pres presentation . i have one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things , so i will just bring that up and show you all before we move on .", "industrial designer : could we could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? in different fruit and vegetable colours ,", "industrial designer : and you could co - ordinate with your house or whatever . all these options .", "user interface designer : maybe th the packaging , it should be like a lemon and the packaging is like the peel . so instead of opening the box you just peel it , and the remote control is inside .", "marketing executive : there we go . the ipod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun . it is like the way it all comes all cute .", "project manager : that is th this is the agenda they gave me . can you just explain what that is real quick ?", "industrial designer : alright , so decisions , what the deci decisions on energy i am thinking is based on the battery . what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ?", "user interface designer : it is good , as long as we consider the cost and the how reliable it is ,", "industrial designer : any more information on cost other than it is more expensive than a regular battery , but if we are using a an i a cheaper chip , then it will even out , .", "industrial designer : circuit boards . i got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . they are they are thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di they are quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . i do not really to tell you as far as decisions . i was not really given any options , i was just given that this is how they are done . i ca not really tell you . tell you a whole lot about how it works . but i any decisions on", "project manager : then we will move on to the case . bu i maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe .", "industrial designer : here is the thing on the chips that i got . simple , regular , advanced chip on print . the chip on print includes an infrared sensor , so we do not have to worry about that . , the pushbutton if we are gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and an l_c_d _ requires advanced . do we want a scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ?", "user interface designer : i do not think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . it might be for changing the volume .", "project manager : but i how useful it would be for changing the channel . you do not have control over numbers", "industrial designer : th it would be handy for going through if there was an on - screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll .", "marketing executive : but if you c if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be", "marketing executive : and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as i am just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker looking . and otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we are gonna have like , black with red sticking out and th no it is gonna inevitably start looking like those group of ugly ones that we saw stacked up .", "industrial designer : when you get on the on - screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus .", "industrial designer : so we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending and maybe we could table that decision for later .", "project manager : w when we go on to the une userface , we are gonna have to decide the interface we are gonna have to decide whether we are gonna have a scroll or not .", "industrial designer : i am kinda liking the idea of latex , if spongy is the in thing .", "project manager : i am a little hesitant about it , because i am worried about protecting the on the inside .", "project manager : i would be more with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone thing .", "industrial designer : n wha what i have seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there is like a hard plastic inside , and it is just covered with the latex . not too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or anything that you have seen like that . the inside is hard . i do not think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board ,", "project manager : we do want latex . and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours . fruity colours . let is go to the ufe user interface then we will come back to the chip i suppose .", "user interface designer : and if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , then we can have a simple chip and it is simpler , it is cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button .", "project manager : and if we had a sc an on - screen thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things .", "project manager : that for channel surfing a scroll an actual like an ipod is scroll thing would be too fast ,", "industrial designer : i say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than a pushbutton , but it is got ta be some more expensive , it might be better to put our money into the like the kinetic battery and the case", "marketing executive : and let is like see if we get anything else . i am not like hard - sold on the scroll wheel , it is more just to give it a different look , but if it is gonna be in a latex type thing and that is gonna look , then that is probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel .", "project manager : it might be enough . , so we are gonna go with type pushbuttons , and then supplements , how are we gonna do that ?", "project manager : i assume that is what else we are gonna like h ha the additional buttons we can use . so we are gonna have like a menu button , so that we can access on - screen things then ? so we are doing an on - screen menu that we can scroll through .", "project manager : pre - set channels and then we are gonna need numbers one through zero ,", "project manager : but in order to pre - set a cha i you can just hold it down when you get to one when you are scrolling through .", "project manager : finishing the meeting now . our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . you will get specific instructions from your personal coach . did we decide on a chip ? let is go with a simple chip ?", "project manager : we are done . i di these are already in our shared folder , so ."], "summary": ["the project manager

cartoon style . but i like cats because they are so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . , but that does not mean they are completely not sociable , they enjoy interacting with humans as , and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , running around outside as being inside , and enjoying their food , and generally just , they just seemed so and

be a really funny dog , i am not how to draw a dog .", "industrial designer : there are loads of different types of dogs , so i am it will represent one dog .", "user interface designer : it is a cartoon dog . a s i do not ev , . it is a scary cartoon dog . that this , that does not look like a dog .", "user interface designer : how do you draw a dog ? i suppose it has a lon my god . yous it is supposed to be . , i like dogs because , they are so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing - eye dogs , and they are just such friendly animals . and , like they are more of a companion than cats .", "user interface designer : i have nothing against cats . cats do not really like me , so i ca not like them . but they are just so friendly and warm and animals , that do not look like that .", "marketing executive : alrighty . i feel like a robot . , i had the most time to think about it . i am going to draw a butterfly , because i saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of spring arriving . and it was actually the prettiest butterfly i have ever seen out in the wild , and i though that was pretty in scotland . it was like , it was a little pointier than that . at first it was a dead leaf . and then it landed on the wall next to me . but this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . and then it kinda there was a green , it was a green ring , and there was like red going out like this .", "marketing executive : it kinda was actually , it was this part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and i am like , this is the middle of scotland in like march . so that was pretty . and it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . i wish i would had my camera . so that is gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like spring is finally here . , what do we", "project manager : yea so , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , the next , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our budget , or not meet our budget but more , like what , selling range we will be looking at , wanna make this selling price of twenty five euros . and so we have to , come up with a way to , to create a , a remote control , where we can like the price to create it will be significantly less . , we would like to , make fifty million euro . i am assuming that is what the m _ means . , and make it for an international market . , one thing we would have to think about internationally is in the design of , like different kinds of , v_c_r_s . things like that , depending on which country you are . another thing for the design team to think about . , we want it to cost , absolute maximum of twelve euro and fifty cents .", "project manager : i am bad at math . , so now that , that is underway , it is discussion time . so this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any suggestions that you may have so far , a your personal experiences with remote controls , and , areas you see that , could be improved in your experience with them . does anyone have any initial thoughts ?", "marketing executive : i find that in the dark it is often hard to button you are pushing .", "project manager :  . so what is something we could , do to remedy that ?", "industrial designer : i always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . it is always , where is the remote control ? so maybe if you could have some tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . you can press a button on your wall , signal ,", "user interface designer : do yous not find that , like , there is a lot of , buttons on your remote control , and you what half of them do .", "marketing executive : there is some remote controls where there is a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you do not really use unless you are programming .", "marketing executive : so you just have like the number buttons , power button , t_v _ video button .", "project manager : anything about , the look of the , remote control that you might have ideas about . maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , something more interesting like any ideas will do that you have at this point

designer : i suppose , if we are he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general more acceptable but we do not wanna go towards boring , that would not sell either .", "project manager : and the key issue here is , is being trendy and original . , that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous . we have five minutes left . so , just to cover we have one more thing . , like you can go over your ideas , in your own personal times . , our next meeting will be in half an hour . so you have half an hour to , think about what you want to present . or not present but bring to the meeting . , i_d _ , whatever that stands for .",

{"article_id": "109", "text": ["project manager : am i starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and i hope you had a productive last thirty minutes . , and , i will be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting is not very necessary for myself , because it will be more about , what you guys are bringing to the meeting today . , so , the first presentation we will be looking at is poppy is presentation . so , take it away poppy .", "industrial designer : is on . i will take this time just to apologise . i , i only , received my emails later on . i was too busy carried away doing my own thing , which is not a very good part of a team - working thing . but there we go .", "industrial designer : so i was looking at how we are going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . and it needs to allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are . they do not need to actually manually touch the television set . so , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be . , from , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there are certain points that will make our product unique . , one is the visibility in the dark , which was genevieve is idea . so we need to think about how we could bring this in technically . and we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we are using a mobile phone , fam familiar . a automatically , lights up at first touch . or we could use fluorescent materials which would just take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . , also we could use an alarm . so if we lost the remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . maybe behind a cushion or somewhere . , so that would work . go back there . , another thing we d missed out on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . , from previous researches i have carried out on other projects , we have learnt about smart materials where specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . so they can be heated and cooled , and they change the shape of the metal . so , a screw that is holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . so , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , everything would spring apart . so , all the individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and that would be very important for products now . especially there is much responsibility for all the companies who are coming up with like new designs . all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious .", "project manager : right , one question . this , self - destructible metal , it allows for recycling materials ? so that , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ?", "industrial designer : and then they would , you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape - memory alloy . and that is the part that would allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . , the user would return the p product to the company , it is the product is responsibility to get rid of what they have made . , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape - memory alloys to split up the components , and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . something like the case , if it is scratched , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else .", "project manager :  . would we be the company that would break down these , or metals ? or would we contribute to another group ?", "industrial designer : you could we could probably empl employ a , a side company to do that for us . but it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . for a certain percentage at least .", "project manager : one thing we have to consider is our one hundred percent turnover goal that we have for our financial sector .", "project manager : so we will have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , it sounds very labour - intensive . you would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive .", "industrial designer : i the fact of the shape - memory alloys is that they , they do not need to be manually de deconstructed . like , you do not have to individually unscrew all the screws . because of this , their properties are smart material . all you need is just the heat , so they self - destruct themselves .", "industrial designer : so i suppose it does need like high contact , high quality machinery , and very specific machinery ,", "project manager : i like the environmental approach . , we will have to see if that can meet our financial goals as .", "industrial designer : also there is components . thiswill be how it will actually work . but i have not put this plan together yet .", "industrial designer : . , should i go back . this would actually show the circuit diagram . although i have not come up with the final circuit yet . so put all those components in .", "project manager : so those are what , we will c construct the remote . those are all the", "industrial designer : i it just shows what energy source . it could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . , an ' , how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself .", "industrial designer : ? so , now is it f _ eight again to escape ?", "user interface designer : i am the user interface designer . , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . , in this case it is the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . by taking inspiration from other similar designs , we will try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . there are two functional design options . a multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . and a single function remote control , used specifically for the television .", "user interface designer : multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . a single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices . , that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it is easier to use . it would be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable . , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . and it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . and less functions would have to be included . so it would be cheaper to make . and probably more sellable just because it is more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . does anyone have any questions ?", "marketing executive : so as far as we know , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ?", "user interface designer : it is just that , when we are creating it , we are , we have to make it compatible with different brands of devices .", "user interface designer : and it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent ,", "project manager : does everyone agree with this ? does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ?", "industrial designer : i was just wondering about the , what genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . and that would probably , i d , what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . i suppose having that would complicate it a lot more . and limit the design .", "marketing executive : i agree with the single design thing for now , because we are trying to do so much , that if we are trying to make a unique , user - friendly , dadada , and it is also multi also multifunctional , we are gonna go over budget for one thing .", "user interface designer : and with this we will have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design .", "marketing executive : . so i will be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . , and i will give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first kick - off meeting , with the coffee machine ? the functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . , so what i will be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . , so what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . , i have done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , and some internet research . and i will show you my findings . and firstly i wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . so we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . so that should be our priority here . , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . not just in electronic fashion . so that it is something that fits in the household .", "marketing executive : we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design . any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , who is famous , what t_v _ shows are being watched , to influence our remote control . , so the findings . , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . which is a , quite a significant number . , the other twenty five percent did not specify if they love them or found them , neutral . eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user .", "project manager : that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . you mean that they would spend more money on a fancy - looking remote control ?", "marketing executive : they are willing to spend money on a remote control with personality . as opposed to your basic , oval black , all same size button remote control . , so it is something that people care about . it is not , it is not ignored in the household . , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . zapping meaning they go through channels a lot .", "marketing executive : they are thumb - masters . , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . that a very small amount . thought that was interesting .", "project manager : alright , so it might be very appealing if , we have very concise buttons .", "project manager : and another thing with lots of surfing , we would probably have to work on something that could be a lot more durable , because i find with channel - changers that , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they are printed on the button .", "marketing executive : and actually to go with that , i am gonna give you some statistics on the relevancy of the buttons , how much they are used . and how important the users find them . so the power button , in an hour is only used once . hopefully the person is not turning on and off the t_v _ . , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . so people wanna be able to turn on the t_v _ with the remote control . , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set . channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour . that is a huge amount . this is the most important button . , so when commercials come on they are changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that is not gonna run down . relevance of that button , our users found was ten , ten out of ten . , ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten . and it is used on average four times an hour . not as much as channel selection , but still significant . , audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . relevance is two . screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour . , and relevance of one point five . we are getting to specific statistics here . teletext , now i am not too clear on what that is . i if you can help me . flipping pages .", "user interface designer : it has t_v _ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment .", "project manager : no it is a button that you press , and then you , like a menu pops up .", "user interface designer : and you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it will come up .", "user interface designer : but you have no interaction back with it , . like the internet you can send emails and you have no interaction .", "industrial designer : it is just information that , like television timetables , what is on now , what is on next , on every channel , and", "marketing executive : alright . i i am not with it , because i was not but it is , it is being used fourteen times an hour . , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . so it looks like something that we are gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control . , channel settings . zero point zero one times an hour . relevance of three . channel settings .", "user interface designer : tuning them in at the very start . if you get a new t_v _ set , you tune in all the channels ,", "marketing executive : . , so it is not used very often , but people still find it relevant . , biggest frustrations of the people that we interviewed . remote controls are often lost somewhere . so that was already discussed by poppy . how we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . so it should be very user - friendly , . people to do very quickly . , remote controls are bad for r_s_i _ .", "marketing executive : designers can look into that . , buttons that do not require , very firm pushing , if they respond . but we will have to also avoid , buttons responding to the slightest touch as . that is a problem .", "marketing executive : did you guys get that one down ? here is some ideas for you . a large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . so i will show you some numbers here . , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . , that would , are willing to pay extra . so i we are gonna have to figure out what age group we are , we are targeting , and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . and if we have the budget for it . , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it .", "project manager : i agree with if we are targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . , financially and functionally . , and especially if we are trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that . , ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably wo not be as concerned .", "marketing executive : so that , that is a whole other field of research . i if it would be , if we would still have a remote , or if you are talking to your television and saying change channel . and depending on how many members you have in households . so it m it may be too complicated for us , but it is something to keep in mind anyway .", "project manager : and something that might further complicate it is that the t_v _ makes noise itself . wonder if it would have", "industrial designer : and if there was conversation in the room at the same time , although in theory it does not tend to be when you are watching television , but could be very difficult to get the specific design .", "project manager : if we are looking for a simplistic design , if we need to decide if that is our intention is , is a simplistic design . , because if , if it is then voice , voice - activated", "project manager : and that would negate the whole remote control thing , because if people can activate the television with their voice then they wo not be using a , they wo not be talking into a remote , i am .", "marketing executive : it would be like the ultimate remote . and th the last thing here was a , an l_c_d _ screen . so , voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . not practical . an l_c_d _ screen though might be something that , you can shift through pages li the way this powerpoint is working . so that you do not have so many buttons to deal with .", "marketing executive : or like an alarm clock . you would have an l_c_d _ versus just a , a normal clock .", "marketing executive : just like an electronic screen . as opposed to just buttons . there would be like a little , like on", "marketing executive : like on the top of a cellphone , the little l_c_d _ screen . , now that is , i , exactly what exactly we would put on there . i the channel that you are on , the v the volume setting .", "user interface designer : could it it would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . but that would probably be", "industrial designer : or like an teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television .", "marketing executive : i that is something we can all take back to our respective research . , and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts . , our priority really should be unique design . , we want something that people want in their home . every remote control looks the same , so in my opinion it should be , user - friendly and unique . so the other might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people . , i th myself , voice recognition scares me off . so if we are , if we are aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product , and for all , the other thing is like age market . if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy . but if we wanna make fifty million , and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe stick to the basics .", "user interface designer : and we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five euros to spend on a remote control . like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they are just starting out and , .", "marketing executive : and we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . , a sixteen year old boy would say , i would pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that is three months allowance . , so , the older generations we should be catering to a bit more .", "project manager : and if one of the largest , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control ,", "project manager : i am that something like an l_c_d _ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem .", "project manager : before we go into more discussion on we want this design to look like , i have received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . , for one thing , because having controls with d_v_d _ , v_c_r _ , that thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . , we have decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television function . which is good as , as we have decided that we would like to go with that anyway . , for many reasons . so we have that decision made for us . another thing that might affect other decisions is that the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . and so we wo not concern ourselves with navigating the teletext option .", "industrial designer : were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ?", "project manager : we do not have the resources or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , but they were just saying that the teletext would not be used . alright , and another thing . this is for the design , the design of the product is that we wanna create , more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . so , all the remote controls must have our we will incorporate our logo and colour in some way . so , perhaps our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good . , it does not have to be the colour of our company", "project manager : but , another thing is that , we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . , i am assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting i , i was not offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable .", "project manager : the little r _ yellow thing ? real reaction ? , yes , those are the changes . , so , now we need to discuss , and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of how this is going to be . i am just going to look at my notes for a second . , we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control . so , we already know that it will just be for the television . it will it wo not have teletext . but , we could discuss those other options that you brought up , genevieve .", "user interface designer : it would be annoying though if i do not use teletext that much , but if it was on your t_v _ , you would want to be able to use it , if", "project manager : but another thing is that if we are reaching an international crowd , i know for one that in north america there is no such thing as teletext , so it would be really superfluous .", "industrial designer : more research required , . but if was it a management decision that we are having", "project manager : it was a management decision , so it is , it is out of our hands at this point .", "project manager : we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had . i am that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same infrared", "project manager : the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise . it is not that expensive to do .", "industrial designer : or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone . like you just a , a buzz .", "user interface designer : would you be able to , put the little device anywhere ? is not our remote control for all t_v_s , so", "user interface designer : c then it would only be a applicable to one t_v _ set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , .", "industrial designer : maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be not very obtrusive . something small that is , that is a good point .", "project manager : then it would not , it probably would not be able to use it would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control i , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller .", "industrial designer : unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the t_v _ is supplied from . the power for the t_v _ .", "project manager : you will have to investi do some research on that , alright ? , alright , and i am that , the glow - in - the - dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , is a go ahead . is everyone interested in that ?", "user interface designer : i like the light up suggestion . that would be better . the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so", "marketing executive : it could it could be a tactile thing as . right , if w if we are minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . and there is something on it . s like up arrow down arrow for , for volume .", "marketing executive : but then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing .", "marketing executive : thought that it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up .", "industrial designer : and also y , heather you mentioned before , like how it should be accessible to everybody . , so like big b buttons , for people you are visually impaired . the glow - in - the - dark or light up wo not make any difference anyway . so like you say tactile might be better , because it would be more available to everybody .", "project manager : could we somehow we could , may , possibly , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow - in - the - dark material . i d i do not think that glow - in - the - dark material , like the actual soft plastic , costs that much more than other colours .", "marketing executive : i the other option , referring to the battery thing is , how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds , when you are s and then it goes ,", "marketing executive : so if , if you are like changing the volume during a movie . i know , i am thinking of mostly when you are watching a movie you turn all the lights off right . and you do not want to turn on the lights , to turn it down , because there is suddenly an explosion , and it is gonna wake up the baby . , so if you touch the button , it reactivates it . it lights up for", "project manager : for the meeting , but we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . , what was i missed the last moment , reading that . what were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ?", "marketing executive : just if it was kinda the same way that a cell how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while . , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it is touched again .", "marketing executive : and you , you touch it and it just lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow .", "marketing executive : so if you have all the lights off in your living room , you will temporarily see it . because usually you are not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds .", "project manager : so that is probably feasible . so , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow - in - the - dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? do we have to decide what we are gonna do with this .", "industrial designer : the shape of the numbers is a really good idea . and that is un unique as .", "industrial designer : i have not seen that . and as you are saying like numbers can wear off if they are just like painted on , printed .", "project manager : and it could , if it is that softer rubber material it will be , maybe , , better for people with els no", "project manager : what is it called , r_s_i _ , what was it that we were talking about ?", "project manager : instead of like hard buttons . , did we want to go for the glow - in - the - dark look ? or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ?", "project manager : like should we do both ? or we can have one or the other ? because it might , for our design purposes , the lighting up thing might be better because glow - in - the - dark material has a funny kinda colour . and it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with .", "marketing executive : i was gonna say , exactly . it the it might be perceived as tacky , glow - in - the - dark . it is like eighties neon - style .", "industrial designer : there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as , which could like link in with the company colours . like it could be blue or green or yellow , or like we have just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so", "user interface designer : i was thinking though , if it was glow - in - the - dark , you could put the real reaction symbol as glow - in - the - dark , and then it would be constantly advertised .", "industrial designer : every time the , that it lit up , you c that could light up as . or , or the , whate", "project manager : but with the same thing , . if you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as .", "project manager : is are you with that ? so that completes most of our more practical decisions .", "project manager : and now it is up to designing . and making that this can be feasible . and do you have anything", "marketing executive : i was just gonna throw out there the thought about personalising the remote control . , it , you mentioned face plates . so if there is something that diff , like five different face plates . if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote .", "marketing executive : and if we would want to go with like t_v _ show themes . like a bart simpson faceplate .", "user interface designer : and then that would be more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as .", "marketing executive : you could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on .", "industrial designer : interchan and also possible , we could gain out of that by advertising certain t_v _ shows , or", "project manager : that might be com problematic with copyright issues . so , if it takes off then we will , we will try that out .", "project manager : we will have to do more research . like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , the way it will look . , does it need to be reached a

powered dynamo which is a thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . a bit out of date . kinetic energy is something that is been recently developed .", "industrial designer : . but it is it would be like going a step back in time . i do not think it would really be with cutting edge technology .", "industrial designer : whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that is being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . , or there is solar power , which we have been considering inside a building , which is where it is gonna be used , might not be quite so useful .", "industrial designer : but , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way . , lots of considerations for the case , like what shape it would be , curved or flat . that is got a lot to do with the ergonomics . like how it is comfortable and s sits in the hand . we do not want something that is huge and you ca not pick up . i know i have had a remote control before which you could not tell which was the front and the back , it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that i would be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button . because you ca not really see which way round it is . , we also can choose what materials , the we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more ideal for the anti - r_s_i _ . it is like the same rubber that is used in stress balls and things like that , so it is very like soft , not so stressful on your hands .", "industrial designer : wood . , again , stepping back in time again there . i do not think that is quite up to date with what we are looking for here . , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . but , would have been maybe for future projects . right our choice for buttons as . we have developed some we have got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some new multiple option scroll buttons . that was brought up for , they are quite a flexible design , modern , you do not have to use individual buttons . you can just slide up and down . i am we are all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads .", "project manager : one thing with the scroll buttons though . it , it we would have to have an l_c_d _", "industrial designer : and that would lead to an advanced if we have we are going on to that later with the advanc with the l_c_d _ that means we would need a really advanced chip . and it is unlikely that is gonna be in our budget .", "industrial designer : also we have got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we are most familiar with . it is the most straightforward . but you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as . got decisions to make there . and this is what i was just saying before . linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs . simple would go with the pushbutton . , regular you could link with the scroll button . and the advanced we would have to go with a l_c_d _ s display . my personal preferences ? we could go for the kinetic energy source . i do not , that is quite an advanced technology . it is not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as . and also energy saving you are producing the energy , you do not need an external battery supply or solar panels . you just give it a shake . sounds brilliant to me . rubber casing i thing would probably the best , if we are going for the anti - r_s_i _ and like more choice with aesthetics . like it could be any colour we want . , and gives you , more flexibility there . and probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no l_c_d _ , we probably ca not afford that one .", "project manager : one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as", "project manager : like as the exterior . this is the one thing that is protecting its innards .", "industrial designer : that would , there would be an in more internal casing . and the rubber would just be the , what is in contact with the human .", "project manager : another thing is it might be more difficult if it is a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates . , is it i do not see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there . like if it was like a clip -

watching . , so we can live up to our , our purpose of having a very fashionable remote control . so , just so , my method was mainly web - based research this time around . i also spoke with fashion experts in milan , new york and paris . and i looked at the design reports from previous years , here at real remote . , just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed . , so i will list the three most important aspects that i have come across . , and they , they are each more important than the one that comes after it . , the first one is that there should be a fancy look - and - feel , instead of the current functional look - and - feel . , this should be our priority , as we have been saying . the second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative . so , we have done a lot of talking about that , just with lighting and the buttons and the face - plates . , so it looks like we will be able to keep on track with that . and the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use . so , pretty basic there . and the recent fashion update , according to fashion - watchers in paris and milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . , also , in contra in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy . again , we have already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons . so , my personal preferences here , as we , we have already talked about the personal face - plates in this meeting , and i would like to stick to that . the fruits and vegetable themes , i if that is going to work for us . it sounds something that you would use on kitchenware . i if we wanna do it on remotes . it could be one of the options . maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen . , the temporary light - up idea , sounds like we are gonna stick to that . and then , tying in a trendy look with user - friendliness .", "project manager : it is the fruits and vegetables is the only area that i find rather jarring . everything else we can really , we can really", "project manager : do , according to our plans already , given the market . but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control .", "marketing executive : it is , it is a little but it , it is everywhere . so maybe we i have seen a lot of purses with olives on them , . but , if we stick to t_v _ based , maybe t_v _ shows , or", "industrial designer : we we possibly could take a more abstract design . like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . and then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . we do not have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , . or a strawberry seed or a leaf .", "industrial designer : or just like really make it a quite abstract , if that is fits in more with what we are doing . instead of fruits and vegetables , just if you look at it straightforward , it is a bit it does not s quite fit in with the trendy , it does , if that is the current theme . but may maybe we could go more directly , i . but initially , . if we just tone it down a bit .", "marketing executive : one thing i was thinking though is if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals . so maybe there could be animal - based , . because a lot of people have a house cat . or , or a dog . , that might be getting , too specific , and we should see what the success of the first face - plates are . but it is something to keep in mind . and , did you have any questions ? pretty straightforward ?", "project manager : given that information , we need to start making some more specific decisions . so i will need to hook up the powerpoint again .", "project manager : i am just trying to make this pop up now . so we have to decide now exactly what we are going to do . so energy , we no i ca not write it in when it is in this setting . does anyone know how to take it out of", "project manager : . , so back to decisions . energy , we have decided on kinetic , right ?", "project manager : but would a backup really be necessary ? will people just use the battery if there is no , if there is ,", "industrial designer : and be bold and innovative , and hope this works , and hope that it works .", "industrial designer : no . i , we should just like take advantage of like using this to its full potential .", "marketing executive : so if it is not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it ?", "industrial designer : it was whether we went for the simple , the regular , or the advanced chip . and that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have , so", "industrial designer : it was so that was without the l_c_d _ . so that means we are not doing the advanced . so it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons .", "project manager : would we need a more advanced one for the lighting , the interior lighting system ?", "industrial designer : possibly . so , it is probably gonna be the regular chip that we are going to need . so it is a medium .", "project manager : and cases . , does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it is made of , or what ?", "industrial designer : so th this is just like gonna be the a very outer case , which we will decide on rubber .", "user interface designer : we decided on the component . i , i am , i have lost my powerpoint thing , so i ca not remember what it is ca it is the component", "project manager : did you say command line ? line interface . and supplements . what is that all about ?", "user interface designer : that is we have not really made any decisions about what we are gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the in consistent use . like what are ideas to combat these problems ? how different interfaces are very different , and can be confusing because of their difference , and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have . we have not really decided what to do about that .", "user interface designer : it is just w where shall we locate the buttons . what functions wi shall we have ?", "project manager : you mean like we will have the numbers of the channels , and we will have the channel -

especially for the user requirements . i prepare a marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and the improvements we could do to the current remote controls . and also i di i did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five , ten years . there is no significant difference between the b the first new controls and", "marketing executive : more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly . so and they admit that the they should s they would spend more money in a fancier remote control , which is good and it is interesting point . also the people are worried about the r*_s_i _ disease , which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not a with a not very appropriate device , you will have problems whe when you will get old . so s people are worried about the shape of the remote control . they are also they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often , so it would be a good point to l to find a solution to any beep any alarm incorporated to with the remote control every time it get lost . and also i found that young people the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the remote control . so in my opinion the mando this mando should not be very small because the smaller it is , the more like the liklier it is to get lost . liklier or more likely ?", "marketing executive : likely . people also complain because they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use like f memorising channels or this actions which are not very often but they should not have the same importance in the remote cont in the remote control . also the z the design should fit the hand shape . so it may be interesting to think in a in both prototypes , for right and left handed people .", "user interface designer : th the on though , most remote controls are used by more than one person . so unless you are targeting single people you are gonna maybe cut out some a lot of your market .", "marketing executive : i th anyway it could be int interesting to release some a small fraction of this remote controls .", "industrial designer : ? , whether it is left hand or right hand , but do not you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ? the first and the third point , they are clashing .", "user interface designer : it means like , this remote here is very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit bigger", "industrial designer : so it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ? little sleek , longer ? and it should fit the hand .", "user interface designer : some finger grips maybe . you could even have some buttons like on the sides and everything ,", "marketing executive : and finally , the incorporation of a l_c_d _ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , but i if the budget would be large enough .", "marketing executive : but most of the young people to thirty years old were really interested in this technology .", "project manager : so maybe it is a good time for me to bring you to some new informations . we had the new requirements from the so from the head offices of the company , and so they wanted so they want to they would like to be restricted to t_v _ . , if you had this information already . no ,", "project manager : so they want us to restrict the remote control to t_v _ only because of time limitations . they want also", "project manager : excellent . so we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because te

interface designer : i was still working on this twenty five euro price point because actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low price if we are maybe get to this in my presentation though , but .", "project manager : so let is keep in mind about tha that this last point about l_c_d _ and speech reco", "user interface designer : even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if you are watching t_v _ you are gonna have a lot of this background noise from the t_v _ which might interfere with the", "user interface designer : participant three . you might have some background noise from the t_v _ which will make the speech recognition much harder , so .", "industrial designer : no it could be command control thing . it requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated . means you say you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition . because this thing means speech is there from the t_v _ also . so there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop . it is like v_i _ editor , you are having two modes similarly . otherwise it is just lying idle .", "user interface designer : great . so while researching this topic i first of all just thought of a couple of things that i would like to see in a remote , and just looked to see if they are actually available in any current remotes , and then also searched for which are the top - rated remote controls on epinions dot com , which is a customer written review site . so there is a pretty wide range of remote controls these days and this remote control on the right here is one of the more extravagant , but it is not really it is by no means on it is own in being so expensive . there are a lot of expensive remote controls out there .", "user interface designer : it doe it is all the functions are controlled through the l_c_d _ screen except for the really main functions , which have a couple of their own buttons . and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out on the market , i know we are working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have these l_c_d _ screens which helps when you are using multiple devices i suppose because you can have multiple functions d different functions on the screen at different times . but the thing that i find most interesting about this remote control , and it is difficult to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , which is like a mouse scroll wheel , which is it is a really important design aspect is it is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do . and the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the channel .", "user interface designer : now the that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of changing the channel . i know when i use the remote to change the channel i very rarely use the numbers on the pad . i usually use the up and down", "user interface designer : because most channels are two digit numbers and you have to press a special button to enter a two - digit number , and then two numbers , so that is just it is annoying . so a scroll wheel is quite handy . the scroll wheel is much more useful if you have an l_c_d _ screen , and this brings us to the point you were mentioning before about the internet capability . one possibility , if we now we need to still talk about the price point because a lot of this ca not be done for twenty five eu euro , but one possibility is to download program information into the l_c_d _ screen so that instead of actually saying i want to go to channel thirty seven because i know this programme is on , often you what ch what channel it is on , or you what is on . if you have a list of programs on your l_c_d _ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel . so if you think about it is like a in mobile phones now you do not use you do not remember people is phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it . so this would be pretty a handy thing to have , but we really need t to discuss the price . so , there are cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it is very simple , there is only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . so this is something else we might wanna consider , is really limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating universal remote control on epinions . it it is really maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as possible because really people want to be able to find the button they are looking for without even looking at the remote control . and was saying before about having different size buttons for different frequently used tasks , but also the location and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . so if you have too many buttons it increases the difficulty of finding the one you want .", "industrial designer : but there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality .", "user interface designer : we will have a bit of a simpler task in that we are only doing a television remote control . maybe one option is to have a little flip - open door that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons . i would if i had my perfect remote control , i would probably just have no numbers on it because they are just in the way . they do not really do anything . maybe i although i do also find flip - open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or whatever , but maybe a door that you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good . but definitely you need to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not let that interfere with the functionality of the device .", "marketing executive : h that the tr the transition to this new remote control should not be very abrupt very hard because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers they will think it is very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional", "user interface designer : i that depends on how you market it . if you if you have the right advertisement showing how easy it is and how you can , navigate to a program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy .", "user interface designer : so , but , so , one of the really useful things you can do with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . so if we can have a higher priced remote control that would really be worth something that would be worth implementing . there is the l_c_d _ screen , which maybe is too expensive , but also at the scroll wheel , i have not mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an l_c_d _ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . even that , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an l_c_d _ screen , to implement , but that would be quite useful as . and the other thing , you say we need to keep it just television , but one maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a fashionable device , is there is a certain or factor that you can have with technology , and maybe we wanna make it something that is extensible to do other tasks . say you have like a little another little base unit that can also receive signals as the television where you can , say , change the lighting in the room . that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it does not have to be part of the initial development , but , later on you could you can you also , selling the potential of the device . then you say potentially you can then do other like change the lights , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , and , that is something we may need to have as at least as an optional extra to kinda make our product , since we say we are putting the fashion in electronics .", "industrial designer : so . so most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition , that means on my own i , it should be .", "industrial designer : so the working design is user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology . so he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the remote . so the old users who do not want to have any changes , it can be useful for them , and the new users , as our marketing expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition thing .", "project manager : to interrupt you , but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel .", "industrial designer : so anyway , that did not come into my mind , so th that is a possibility . these could be other interfaces . means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different interfaces . so spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with . so if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people it is , and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty - five euros money which we are thinking . otherwise we are just like others in the market . so anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , and that means we can do the on - line changes which can not be done now actually . so apart from the speech , we can have the scroll thing with the buttons . now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required . and for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote .", "project manager : do you think that performance of such systems are enough to target of such technologies is enough ?", "industrial designer : yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it is enough . we can target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc", "project manager : wh i imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance a an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into th into the remote control .", "user interface designer : one other thing that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is when you want to sell into other markets , though , because , i am not exactly where we are gonna sell this , but i presume it is not gonna just be english speaking countries . so then you have to s , you have to train models for", "industrial designer : it is more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing so d_t_w _ could be which is the easiest . so you have to store some templates on the chip itself , and it is just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro - controller .", "project manager : we shou we should discuss this la later after this slide . this is a this is a very important issue in discussion .", "industrial designer : so this is the design which we are thinking so . we are having a power button and the switch , which is not much , and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not . and then there are two things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because of lack of time . so we could not put that . so now where the a_s_r _ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different interfaces which could be there . so there is a_s_r _ decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format . and then there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver . so this is the easiest design the there could be . so th an a_s_r _ decoder we can have things in . to have different technologies . so this was the my personal preference was that we can have a_s_r _ sitting there on the remote control .", "user interface designer : i you could actually train the remote control as you are using it by saying turn volume up , and you press the button like s people teach sign language to kids f , by speaking and doing", "industrial designer : but as soon as you try to put the microchip thing the price will go up . so these are the slight problems .", "industrial designer : because the reason is that if we go into the market means though i do not have much idea , but as he the marketing expert presentation was", "marketing executive : i am if you can sell a speech recognition remote control for twenty five euros everyo everyone will s will buy it .", "user interface designer : if i was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because i ca not hear it very , i do not really want to drown out what people are saying by talking when i am instead of pressing up on a remote control . if there is some dialogue all of a sudden that i ca not hear , i am trying to actually find out what is being said , so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps .", "user interface designer : maybe if the remote control is something that y you do not actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a useful feature of the speech recogntion . if you can leave it sitting on the table and you do not actually have to find it , then that could be .", "project manager : so if i summarise everything we have de we said . we are targeting t_v _ . we need we need to have remote control which is fanc fancy , which is easy to hand not too small , not too big . we have", "project manager : or good shape , yes . we should bring new technologies for young peoples , and as we have also requirements to use to push thr toward the internet . maybe this is something we can stick to it . and also , a very interesting things i have seen on the one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate . so so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an target price , it is not possible to go s to go to l_c_d _ and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies . first m why not to go to l_c_d _ . because as we are targeting t_v _ we can use t_v _ screen as a screen to feedback to give some feedback informations about what we could have .", "user interface designer : it depends though it depends . if we do not unless we have some input some video input to the t_v _ or we have control over the t_v _ then we ca not actually display that . like if we produce the t_v_s then we can put menus up there , but otherwise we need to actually have some something sitting in between the video signal and the t_v _ to superimpose those menus . so that is an extra", "project manager : do not we have contacts with people on t_v _ or systems that exist that we can use ?", "user interface designer : this is another que we still have not really defined the remote . are we still you say we are focusing on t_v _ , but is it still a like a universal remote in that it is a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of televisions ? that really makes a big difference . even if we have contacts we ca not really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other companies ' t_v_s . it is just there are too many t_v_s out there . it is it is not really gonna", "project manager : . that is good point . what is what cou what could be the cost of , could we fit the targets in terms of cost if we go s to l_c_d _ on the remote control ?", "user interface designer : but but , it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that any leeway in that twenty five euro because for twenty five euro all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , and that seems to be against the philosophy of our company which is putting the fashion into electronics . so i would like to know if there is any chance of increasing the unit price .", "project manager : so you mean yo you mean we should target something maybe which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to had to have really an added value ?", "marketing executive : wha but what would be one question , what would be the goal of putting an l_c_d _ in a remote control ?", "user interface designer : you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide .", "project manager : th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can get thr through the channel .", "project manager : they have t most of them have teletext , but we want to get rid one of our requirements is to move to teletext to the use of internet . so

programmes you could have o", "user interface designer : you could have a l even a little image of the c the m the main actors so you can quickly just even without reading", "user interface designer : no , but there are the electronic programme guides out there . they may not have pictures , but maybe they do .", "project manager : because for the same reason that we can not informations on the t_v _ . we c we could not grab information which is not there .", "user interface designer : no but with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from . so it may be possible that there are people out there providing that .", "project manager : so that mean w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the t_v _ , or it should be a special t_v _ connected to", "user interface designer : if we are gonna we would definitely need the internet connection because even with y i do not think you could even get teletext information from the t_v _ onto the remote control , especially if we do not control the t_v _ . we need to find that out .", "industrial designer : what market we are targeting ? is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ? so the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of l_c_d _ thing could be as high as the t_v _ itself .", "project manager : and they want to go t for universal one , and they take the fanciest they can have . so this is that we z that we should target . so the com the the committment is the following

evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . then we will have to go through finance evaluation of the cost of the thing and hopefully we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five euro

it is lost . so guys let this wonderful thing .", "user interface designer : we have first of all we made a an attractive base station with a banana leaf look and feel and", "user interface designer : bana sit the banana sits in there k nicely weighted so that it is not gonna tip over and this is the remote itself , it is ergonomic , it fits in the hand rather . we have got the two scroll wheels

interface designer : this is a teletext button . so once you press that then you get teletext and you can use the channel selector scroll wheel as", "user interface designer : then you can you have like a little number selection thing , you press the teletext button to move between the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go you scroll to seven and then

calling the banana .", "user interface designer : actually they do . that is that is that is form and function in the one object .", "industrial designer : so it always means , whatever the rays goes by they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage . it is like antennas .", "industrial designer : and for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this

: a child would try to eat it anyway , so maybe we should consider that . maybe health and safety aspects .", "project manager : so for the power source , you still you want to use both solar cells

and this can move the smaller digits .", "industrial designer : . so there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape . so we are targeting a
