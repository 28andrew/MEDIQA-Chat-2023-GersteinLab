100,"project manager : right . conceptual design meeting . , so right from the last meeting i was trying to send you the minutes , but it did not work out too , so maybe in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we had . right , so wishing i had not closed the damn right so we had the fact that we are gonna have the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . we are gonna have effectively two pages , a front page which had the features that the customers most wanted , and then the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements . and the customers would not have to look at them too often , only as and when required . so what decisions have we made ? have there been any changes ?
industrial designer : we all have a presentation again , so if we go through those and then
project manager : three presentation , .
industrial designer : shall i go first again ?
project manager : so , fine .
industrial designer : i see this a little more smoothly than the last one . right , let is get started . the for the i will back actually . for the components design , next step is the way the remote is gonna work is still the same idea as before . we still have the user interface which is all the buttons we are gonna incorporate . then there is a chip and still the sender . so yes including the power s supply as . i will go on to my findings in each of these areas . first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , there is a dynamo . any of you think of like the old torches which you wind up there is a kinetic option , which if any of you have seen those new watches which you power up by waving around , it just requires a small amount of movement which would mean the batteries would not have to be replaced . that is one option ,
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : but that was gonna cost a little more . and then there is solar cells . as a final option . for the buttons , we have an integrated push button , which is just to say all these are supplied by real reaction . so i for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options . so for the buttons there is an integrated push button , which i is just the same as the standard ones . this says it is similar to the button on the mouse for a normal for like modern computer . there is a scroll wheel which is the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , which may be for the volume .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : you could do that . one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , so we have to take that into consideration . moving on to the printed s
project manager : what would be the cost do we know ?
industrial designer : that is on the next i th the there was not too much difference in the cost , that related to the actual buttons , but it does affect the printed circuit board . which is the next section . for the circuit board which is the middle , it is just see it down there the chips like the workings of the actual of the remote . the firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced circuit board . and there is different prices according to each . so if we have got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard push button . one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . there is a small unit available through the company which would be an extra cost , but it would not affect the size of the remote too much . and i that would require a more advanced circuit board , so there is an extra price in that sense . there is th an extra cost in that sense . going to my personal preferences , possibly for power we could use kinetic which is the idea of the watches that you move the remote around to power it up . and this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . for the buttons , we would probably get away with just having the standard push buttons rather than the scroll wheel . and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . so if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , then we would have to get a more costly circuit board . and that is it .
project manager : with the printed circuit boards you were going for the
industrial designer : i it depends if we are gonna have the speech recognition , we would have to probably get an advanced one . i am guessing . but i , so that is something i will have to look into .
project manager : but are we going f r right .
industrial designer : that is a decision for all of us .
project manager : so are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we are discussing that issue ,
industrial designer : we decide .
project manager : so would it not be best to rather than one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were . the other way would be to do the presentation and then make the decision at that point in time .
industrial designer : . maybe w
user interface designer : that is probably a better one , to discuss it straight away .
project manager : at that point then you have got the details up there , so if we wanted to know that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance . then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue . does that make sense ?
industrial designer : yes .
user interface designer : i have a lot of the information there . it might not be very clear .
industrial designer : is there
user interface designer : unless you want to plug it back in to yours .
industrial designer : we could do , . as i say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel , it did not the voice recognition came as a separate piece of information .
project manager : no the scroll wheel required the regular , so the
industrial designer : if you down . it is just this bit at the bottom which i have highlighted , but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip , which is in the higher price range .
project manager : the display requires an advanced chip
user interface designer : the scroll wheel
project manager : the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense .
industrial designer : also the display is for something else which we decided against . but that bit and note that the push button just requires a simple chip , so that would keep the price down .
project manager : down .
user interface designer : and if we are going for sleek and sexy , a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky ? i have got pictures i have seen pictures with it sticking off the side of it ,
project manager : right .
user interface designer : and they do not really look great .
industrial designer : so maybe just a simple push button , and that would cut costs on the
project manager : so . so we are going for p . so is
marketing executive : so are we going for the w are we going for the simple one , are we ?
user interface designer : a simple pushbuttons .
project manager : simple push button .
industrial designer : did everyone get this on the speech recognition ? the it was what we said before , the idea that you record in a set message , and then it picks up that message and replies to you . so it is the concept we discussed before . but then we for whether it would require a more complicated circuit board . i am guessing it would , but got like the definite information . maybe we should go on what we are certain of rather than
project manager : so if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we are going for the simple printed circuit board are we ? or are we going for the regular ?
industrial designer : if it is just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board .
project manager : mm - mm . but is there any other , that is true for the for that element , but we have to take all el elements into consideration . and so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them . s
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : i suppose we need to find out what circuit board that requires , maybe before we m make a decision .
user interface designer : but the way that i interpret that it does not seem to send out a signal to the telly , it just it is like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message .
marketing executive : i suppose so , .
industrial designer : so maybe that would be something separate , .
user interface designer : so i do not think it would effect our circuit board .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : so we would have a simple circuit board and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it . that makes sense .
user interface designer : and i do not think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it . the example that they have given there is good morning coffee machine , good morning jo . it might be useful to say like where are you remote . here i am , jo . but that is maybe as far as that one could go ?
industrial designer : that makes sense , so we would stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra possibility .
user interface designer : just as a fun way to find it .
industrial designer : .
project manager : simple circuit board .
user interface designer : and it says that
project manager : you were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply .
user interface designer : it said the cost of that is not too much .
industrial designer : so just for ease of not having to replace the batteries .
project manager : and how does it get charged up ?
industrial designer : it is it works on the basis they have some ball bearings inside . it is it is some on watches which you shake to power it up . somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement . so you would move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it .
project manager : so the speech recognition was are we going for speech recognition ? that required the advanced
user interface designer : it would be helpful to find it , but i do not think it would
marketing executive : just
industrial designer : did we decide it did not affect the circuit board , it just affected
user interface designer : so .
marketing executive : just just for the call and find thing .
industrial designer : it was just
project manager : i had speech recognition requires advanced req require
industrial designer : no th that is what , but maybe it does not . i might have got that wrong .
marketing executive : it is separate is not it ,
project manager : speech recognition you reckon then is s simple .
marketing executive : it is not part of the
industrial designer : it is it is just an addition thing it is
project manager : and so we would want it in as an extra because it does not appear to cost too much . would that be
user interface designer :  .
industrial designer : shall i pass on to you now ?
project manager : it would not really cost anymore , would it ?
user interface designer : i will just check what it said . actually i do not think it really says anything about the cost , but it says that it is already in the coffee machines , so like it is already
industrial designer : i assume it would cost extra , but maybe we maybe we will find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later .
project manager : and then have to change all change everything at the last minute . s
user interface designer : that was quick . , so very brief presentation , . from looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly sleek and sexy . i have not actually got the examples of the scroll button there , but there is some curved cases that you can see , a range of sizes . all of them have a lot of buttons there they seem to just have the rubber buttons . does that move it ?
project manager : ?
user interface designer : it just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything .
project manager : i have found that try and get it back .
industrial designer : if you right click and then go onto a previous slide .
user interface designer : it is alright .
industrial designer : right .
user interface designer : . there was not much more to say about that , just rambling . some of the remotes that i looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could where it was connected to the remote control functions . and it was quite a swish model , where it can control four devices , t_v _ , cable , satellite , video , d_v_d _ , audio . so that is a bit of competition there . so maybe it is better not to try and compete with that thing and just to market it as a completely different like different viewpoint as a finding your lost control
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : rather than trying to compete with the functions . the scroll buttons , as you have already mentioned , there is examples of those , but they do not look as sleek as other models . and there is no real advantage and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it is not great .
industrial designer : on the price , .
project manager : so you were saying the scroll buttons
user interface designer : th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , . there was children is remote , where they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b bright and colourful and you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels . but i if that is really in our field ?
industrial designer : i we are going for the biggest market , maybe not ,
user interface designer : but that is something that is out there .
industrial designer : but was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ?
project manager : we are to go for the international market rather than a local market but that would not necessarily preclude the one thing that you can often do with products is you can make small modifications . so you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , and then you could have additional features in like a you would have model one , model two and model three , and therefore you can sub - divide your market up . but that is really where your field is .
industrial designer : so maybe the children is remote should be like a next step , but maybe for ours , maybe we should
project manager : anyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one i am reckoning that we are going for the basic model to be discussed here and that you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments . is that
user interface designer : right that is something that we can be aware of .
project manager : so so what are we deciding to do here ?
user interface designer : because there is already very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a finder function .
project manager : the fi the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote .
industrial designer : so you also said for going for the international market that some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition . s s so
user interface designer : different languages might not be compatible .
industrial designer : it w it would make it quite complicated , where ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the
user interface designer : you program this one yourself , like to say like whatever you want to your question .
marketing executive : and ours is quite a cheap device , so i how much we will be able to put into it .
project manager : so you would have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature . and you were talking
user interface designer : maybe unless something else comes up .
project manager : and you were talking about scroll buttons ?
user interface designer : i think we have decided that it is gonna increase the cost and give no real kinda extra benefit
project manager : b
user interface designer : and it is gonna decrease from the sleekness of it .
project manager : alright , so we are just gonna have the rubber buttons , was that right ?
industrial designer : yes yes .
user interface designer : and just to be aware that there are specialist functions and specialist remotes but we probably do not want to focus on those like such as the children is remote .
project manager : . so not to be focused on .
user interface designer : there was a mention just as a warning about button design . just to avoid ambiguity . so it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have a v _ on for volume , let is think how they did this .
project manager : good in flip it round in ninety degree a hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down .
user interface designer : i am just gonna check so i do this right .
project manager : an upside - down v _ . so that would show that volume was going up , whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down .
user interface designer : . what did they say ? the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , somebody might look at this one and say this triangular button is pointing up , and that is the first thing that they see actually that ca not be right , can it ? , no , they might see this pointing down and think right that is gonna turn the volume down , whereas the actual button is pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up . so , be careful what you put on the buttons
industrial designer : so maybe we could have like
user interface designer : and be careful of the shape that you make them , because they might be two contradicting shapes .
industrial designer : i you mean . so maybe we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the buttons themselves .
project manager : you could have volume up and volume
industrial designer : possible .
project manager : volume up , down and like that . and the idea was to have limited it was to have sizable amount of information on it . limited number of buttons . it was sixteen buttons , was not it that were
industrial designer : we got it down to not too many .
user interface designer : and that is all i had to say for that . so what was the decision on the design of the volume button ?
industrial designer : are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , or are we gonna t
marketing executive : i have got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching .
industrial designer : maybe we should see yours first .
marketing executive : right , i have been looking at some trends in fashion on top of doing the research into the remote control market the one that is the one i talked about last time , that we would asked people about remote controls and what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . and we have also been looking at fa fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment . so we have had people in paris and milan watching the fashion trends .
project manager : yourself .
marketing executive : so just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation . the most important thing was that the thing look and felt fancy rather than just functional . and second , there should be some technological innovation . and then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as . and , the fashion trends are that people want clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme . but the feel of the material should be spongy , which is contrary to last year , . i presume it must have been not spongy last year . we need to emphasise the fancy design with on our remote control above all else . and then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our find the thing with a hand clap . and then we need to ma make it easy to use that is as a third priority , so perhaps fewer buttons and functions as we have discussed . and then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we capture people is imaginations . so maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , or the buttons could be spongy , somehow . maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than hard plastic . and then even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote , say in the shape of a banana like that . right , so that will be it . maybe a banana or courgette . how how far we actually want to go along and follow the trends , do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , or , do they not matter that much ?
user interface designer : if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use .
project manager : you were just talking about you have got to be careful how you shape your buttons , you are can mis - direct people . and i would have thought the functionality the people get cheesed off by things by having to read instructions et cetera , so .
user interface designer : maybe just one button , say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . maybe that could be a little apple .
marketing executive : maybe .
project manager : .
user interface designer : and then that would not get in the way of like kinda one to nine , and it would not confuse the numbers .
project manager : stand - by button . th that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you are looking for functionality .
industrial designer : i maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment , but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are ,
project manager : but what are they gonna be next what are they gonna be next year .
industrial designer : maybe
user interface designer : . s
project manager : but but th but you can incorporate the tr if y if you change all the buttons then you have got the problem that this year is fruit and veg , next year is i was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever .
marketing executive :
project manager : that means you are constantly changing your production schedule ,
marketing executive : i am not
project manager : and you have got ta make different moulds and everything else , so that is not a good idea i would suggest .
marketing executive : i am not what the timescale we are thinking of selling the product over is .
industrial designer : it just seems realistic that the remote control market is not the thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : to something which is maybe more universal .
user interface designer : but i suppose as long as it is quite a subtle design , even if the design changes ,
industrial designer : we c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly .
project manager : d but if
industrial designer : maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about , .
project manager : .
industrial designer : maybe still with a rubber design we could
project manager : was that in the fashion sense that this or was the spongy feel was that fashion ? it was , was not it ? so the
user interface designer : it seems like you are gonna have rubber cases , as buttons . and that you can make them curved or double - curved and that would be the sleek and sexy look .
industrial designer : one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case .
user interface designer : right , that fits , does not it ?
industrial designer : it is if you use the rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons . that is the way round . if you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it . which makes sense .
user interface designer : right .
project manager : rubber buttons require rubber case .
user interface designer : and that would fit in with what we want , would not it , for the spongy feel , to have everything rubber .
project manager : so , . the m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ? in essence in the production you want things to stay you want to mint them out if you have got fashion changes and that you are incorporating , then it means that your stock is last year is stock and therefore you are selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you would not want to do . whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle . you are just changing one aspect like the standby button like that , and especially then you could make it something that
industrial designer : i suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual
project manager : you might be limited in space , that yes .
industrial designer : would or not .
project manager : you two are gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to how much pl how much how pliable is plasticine .
industrial designer : maybe we could think of the cases like changing with the fashions like the nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . but whether that would be too much to incorporate in production , whether that would just increase the costs , make it more complicated .
project manager : so you are talking there about changing the casing .
marketing executive : that is possibly it .
industrial designer : the a the actual the look from the outside , so where the buttons would stay the same , and the general function of the remote would stay the same , but you could change the way it looked .
user interface designer : and then you could have but you still would have to have the logo on every new case ,
industrial designer : that is true .
user interface designer : but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that .
project manager : you could do a colour change , so therefore you would that is effectively what they did with the mobile phones , was to have some in blue , some in red , some in rather than all in black or , which four do you want , as long as it is black ? but so
industrial designer : so it is a possibility , .
user interface designer : but we are supposed to use the company colour scheme , are not we ?
project manager : yes that is true
user interface designer : we have not really seen that yet
industrial designer : yes
project manager : that might no
industrial designer : that is
user interface designer : it might and we might be able to do both but it might clash with certain things .
project manager : not necessarily , because you could have your company we are we are meant to be finishing up . you could have your company badge and logo . a lot of computers like on the one you have got there , it actually has a stick on badge so what you would al all you would really need , whether it , whether the casing be w any colour , could be any colour , but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it so that in a sense , with a logo like that , because it is on a white background , the only colour that it might not stick out so on would be a white casing . you are badging it .
industrial designer :  .
project manager : and a lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own badge over the top . and the way they have got that there even if you had that on a white , which is the predominant colour of the windows badge , you would still be able to see it clearly from a white casing product .
industrial designer : and whether we would have a big enough market to have this like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider .
user interface designer : if it is for young people , like the phone generation , that thingwould probably go down , and the market research has been on that side of things , has not it ?
marketing executive : it is people say that it is the look , they want the fancy looking thing but i am not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into . with the mobiles , it is the , it is a communication device , people see you with it all about and
industrial designer : i suppose , where you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time .
marketing executive : i if it
project manager : it is in the house , is not it , i suppose .
user interface designer : so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case
project manager : so do not change case . change case colour . and we are saying no to that .
user interface designer : did we decide on the rubber case ? the spongy feel , or did we think that might go as a trend ?
marketing executive : it was different last year . the trend was different last year . it was not spongy feel . but i whether the trend will change . i whether it is one of those things that like having all fruit shaped keys , that probably would go out of fashion very quickly , whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less of something that y you are gonna end up hating in a year , .
industrial designer : less likely to
project manager : sounds reasonable . if you are going for fashion trends like that they will need t you would have to have interchangeable cases
industrial designer : so then th that would
project manager : so that you could or otherwise someone is gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case .
industrial designer : it seems to make sense that we would just maybe stick with the standard rubber case , and then have the standard rubber buttons as .
user interface designer : we have not really talked about the curvature of the case . there is flat , there is single - curved and there is double - curved .
industrial designer : mayb
user interface designer : i am not exactly what these things look like .
industrial designer : maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ? but the double curve would not require us to perform miracles with the plasticine .
user interface designer : it says that
marketing executive : when you say d when you say double - curved , what exactly does that mean ?
user interface designer : i am not exactly . i will show you the remotes that i have got . see how let is just get that bigger . see how the one i am not plugged in , am i ?
marketing executive : no you are not connected to me anymore .
user interface designer : that does not help .
project manager : one one thing to cons
user interface designer : shall turn it round for time ?
project manager : one thing to consider is that in some ways you want by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other
marketing executive : that should come up .
project manager : therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other . whereas if you do fancy things with it , you then got ta put it in a ca a packaging box that does that . and the cost of packaging could be quite important vis - a - vis the total cost of the product .
industrial designer : so shall we go through quickly and just work out what we have decide on , if we have to
project manager : so but
user interface designer : it is not very clear up there , but you can see some of them have got bulges , like the second one and the end one where there is a curve there .
marketing executive : right .
user interface designer : i am not exactl i if a double curve is maybe it comes up slightly , or ?
marketing executive : that is what i was trying to work out .
user interface designer : but it is a kinda sleeker look if you have got curves in there .
project manager : s so do you wanna go for curves , more curves ?
marketing executive : shall we
project manager : we are meant to be f we are meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so .
user interface designer : definitely a single , maybe a double .
industrial designer : so shall we quickly
user interface designer : shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ?
industrial designer : we will go for single curve , .
project manager : curved or double curved ? so it is single curved .
industrial designer : so did we decide on the kinetic power supply ? the one you move around ?
marketing executive : that is a good idea .
user interface designer : and the rubber push buttons , rubber case .
marketing executive : rubber buttons and case .
user interface designer : and we do not really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we ,
industrial designer : we ca
user interface designer : but possibly a sticker .
industrial designer : we will still have the are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down ? i th we can by not having anything too complicated .
user interface designer : and the voice recognition , we can use that ca not we , just to find it . without affecting the circuit board .
project manager : yes .
industrial designer : and see we could always decide against it if something comes up that is just something to that we seemed to leave out .
marketing executive : and then are we going for one button shaped like a fruit .
user interface designer : that sounds like it would not do too much harm in a couple of years . what shape do we want ?
project manager : so we have got spongy feel buttons as , have we ?
marketing executive : maybe just
project manager : as as or w or was that
marketing executive : that is ru rubber buttons , .
project manager : so it is rubber buttons ,
industrial designer : it was just
project manager : so it is not really spongy feel buttons , it is just rubber buttons . with a rubber case right ?
user interface designer : so it is not too wacky .
marketing executive : reasonably spongy i , .
project manager : and the standby button is gonna be different .
user interface designer : an apple would be a good recognisable shape . if you start getting into kinda aubergines and things , it gets a bit weird .
project manager : so what shape are we making the standby button ?
marketing executive : apple ?
project manager : a apple .
user interface designer : vote ? shall we vote on it ?
industrial designer : we will go for the a apples .
user interface designer : anyone got any suggestions ?
marketing executive : apple apple a qu quite a big one , as .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : a big apple .
user interface designer : it could be red .
marketing executive : could be a red apple , . either , do not mind .
project manager : a red apple ?
user interface designer : we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can , once we find out
industrial designer : and then we are gonna are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple ? just like the just working out what we are gonna do for the next time .
user interface designer : that seems pretty straight forward . most of them will just be mainly circular or like very plain .
project manager : what was that last thing again there ?
user interface designer : just to keep the shape of the buttons simple .
project manager : right much option on that . you were going for a single curve and
user interface designer : just the shape of the buttons .
project manager : alright .
industrial designer : and j , just keeping the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as . fairly self explanatory .
project manager : right , so shape of buttons simple . so that is that , i . we should now go away and get these things sorted out . i you two are on plasticine duty or whatever .
industrial designer : is that the end ?
marketing executive : looks like it .","the project manager reviewed the minutes from the last meeting . the industrial designer discussed options for each of the internal components . he showed that the size of the chip was dependent on the type and number of additional features used . the group discussed incorporating speech recognition and other functions to be able to decide on chip size . they decided that using speech recognition for the locator function only would allow them to use a simple chip . the user interface designer presented several existing products . she presented a specialized children's remote; the group decided to focus on a basic remote that would appeal to a wide market . she expressed that buttons are often ambiguously shaped and that their remote must have an easy-to-use interface . the marketing expert presented trends in the remote control market and the fruit and vegetable and spongy material trends in fashion . the group discussed ways to incorporate these trends . they decided to make the standby button shaped like an apple , to use a rubber case and buttons , and to use a single-curved shape . the project manager instructed the user interface designer and the industrial designer to construct the prototype . the user interface designer and the industrial designer will construct the prototype . the group decided to use speech recognition but only for the locator function . the remote will feature push buttons instead of scroll buttons , and a kinetic power supply . the remote will contain a simple chip . the group decided to focus on a basic remote that will appeal to the widest market . they also decided to market the speech recognition component as a ""finder function"" so as not to confuse it with more advanced speech recognition components in other remote controls . the group decided to make the standby button in the shape of an apple . the remote will also feature a rubber case and rubber buttons , and a single-curved design . the remote will feature the company logo , possibly in a sticker form .
","the industrial designer presented the options for components and materials that would have to be changed in order to maintain the appearance of the prototype . he discussed the costs involved in adding speech recognition , an lcd screen , and a kinetic battery . the marketing expert presented consumer preferences and requirements and the prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). the user interface designer presented the prototype to the group and discussed the layout of the interface . the group then discussed the color scheme of the device . the group decided to use the company logo in the design of the device . the project manager reviewed the minutes of the previous meeting . the group discussed the costs involved in adding speech recognition , an lcd screen , and a kinetic battery , as well as the layout of the interface . the project manager instructed the user interface designer to construct the prototype , the marketing expert to prepare the prototype evaluation , and the industrial designer to construct the case for the device . the user interface designer will construct the prototype . the marketing expert will prepare the evaluation . the group decided to use the company logo in the design of the device . the remote will not feature speech recognition . the remote will have a kinetic battery . the remote will have a scroll wheel . the buttons will be push-button-up and down . the lcd screen will be on the remote . the case will be made of rubber .",x,,x,x,,,,,6.0,Pegasus-Cons
101,"project manager : right . conceptual design meeting . , so right from the last meeting i was trying to send you the minutes , but it did not work out too , so maybe in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we had . right , so wishing i had not closed the damn right so we had the fact that we are gonna have the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . we are gonna have effectively two pages , a front page which had the features that the customers most wanted , and then the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements . and the customers would not have to look at them too often , only as and when required . so what decisions have we made ? have there been any changes ?
industrial designer : we all have a presentation again , so if we go through those and then
project manager : three presentation , .
industrial designer : shall i go first again ?
project manager : so , fine .
industrial designer : i see this a little more smoothly than the last one . right , let is get started . the for the i will back actually . for the components design , next step is the way the remote is gonna work is still the same idea as before . we still have the user interface which is all the buttons we are gonna incorporate . then there is a chip and still the sender . so yes including the power s supply as . i will go on to my findings in each of these areas . first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , there is a dynamo . any of you think of like the old torches which you wind up there is a kinetic option , which if any of you have seen those new watches which you power up by waving around , it just requires a small amount of movement which would mean the batteries would not have to be replaced . that is one option ,
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : but that was gonna cost a little more . and then there is solar cells . as a final option . for the buttons , we have an integrated push button , which is just to say all these are supplied by real reaction . so i for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options . so for the buttons there is an integrated push button , which i is just the same as the standard ones . this says it is similar to the button on the mouse for a normal for like modern computer . there is a scroll wheel which is the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , which may be for the volume .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : you could do that . one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , so we have to take that into consideration . moving on to the printed s
project manager : what would be the cost do we know ?
industrial designer : that is on the next i th the there was not too much difference in the cost , that related to the actual buttons , but it does affect the printed circuit board . which is the next section . for the circuit board which is the middle , it is just see it down there the chips like the workings of the actual of the remote . the firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced circuit board . and there is different prices according to each . so if we have got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard push button . one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . there is a small unit available through the company which would be an extra cost , but it would not affect the size of the remote too much . and i that would require a more advanced circuit board , so there is an extra price in that sense . there is th an extra cost in that sense . going to my personal preferences , possibly for power we could use kinetic which is the idea of the watches that you move the remote around to power it up . and this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . for the buttons , we would probably get away with just having the standard push buttons rather than the scroll wheel . and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . so if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , then we would have to get a more costly circuit board . and that is it .
project manager : with the printed circuit boards you were going for the
industrial designer : i it depends if we are gonna have the speech recognition , we would have to probably get an advanced one . i am guessing . but i , so that is something i will have to look into .
project manager : but are we going f r right .
industrial designer : that is a decision for all of us .
project manager : so are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we are discussing that issue ,
industrial designer : we decide .
project manager : so would it not be best to rather than one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were . the other way would be to do the presentation and then make the decision at that point in time .
industrial designer : . maybe w
user interface designer : that is probably a better one , to discuss it straight away .
project manager : at that point then you have got the details up there , so if we wanted to know that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance . then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue . does that make sense ?
industrial designer : yes .
user interface designer : i have a lot of the information there . it might not be very clear .
industrial designer : is there
user interface designer : unless you want to plug it back in to yours .
industrial designer : we could do , . as i say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel , it did not the voice recognition came as a separate piece of information .
project manager : no the scroll wheel required the regular , so the
industrial designer : if you down . it is just this bit at the bottom which i have highlighted , but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip , which is in the higher price range .
project manager : the display requires an advanced chip
user interface designer : the scroll wheel
project manager : the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense .
industrial designer : also the display is for something else which we decided against . but that bit and note that the push button just requires a simple chip , so that would keep the price down .
project manager : down .
user interface designer : and if we are going for sleek and sexy , a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky ? i have got pictures i have seen pictures with it sticking off the side of it ,
project manager : right .
user interface designer : and they do not really look great .
industrial designer : so maybe just a simple push button , and that would cut costs on the
project manager : so . so we are going for p . so is
marketing executive : so are we going for the w are we going for the simple one , are we ?
user interface designer : a simple pushbuttons .
project manager : simple push button .
industrial designer : did everyone get this on the speech recognition ? the it was what we said before , the idea that you record in a set message , and then it picks up that message and replies to you . so it is the concept we discussed before . but then we for whether it would require a more complicated circuit board . i am guessing it would , but got like the definite information . maybe we should go on what we are certain of rather than
project manager : so if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we are going for the simple printed circuit board are we ? or are we going for the regular ?
industrial designer : if it is just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board .
project manager : mm - mm . but is there any other , that is true for the for that element , but we have to take all el elements into consideration . and so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them . s
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : i suppose we need to find out what circuit board that requires , maybe before we m make a decision .
user interface designer : but the way that i interpret that it does not seem to send out a signal to the telly , it just it is like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message .
marketing executive : i suppose so , .
industrial designer : so maybe that would be something separate , .
user interface designer : so i do not think it would effect our circuit board .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : so we would have a simple circuit board and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it . that makes sense .
user interface designer : and i do not think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it . the example that they have given there is good morning coffee machine , good morning jo . it might be useful to say like where are you remote . here i am , jo . but that is maybe as far as that one could go ?
industrial designer : that makes sense , so we would stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra possibility .
user interface designer : just as a fun way to find it .
industrial designer : .
project manager : simple circuit board .
user interface designer : and it says that
project manager : you were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply .
user interface designer : it said the cost of that is not too much .
industrial designer : so just for ease of not having to replace the batteries .
project manager : and how does it get charged up ?
industrial designer : it is it works on the basis they have some ball bearings inside . it is it is some on watches which you shake to power it up . somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement . so you would move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it .
project manager : so the speech recognition was are we going for speech recognition ? that required the advanced
user interface designer : it would be helpful to find it , but i do not think it would
marketing executive : just
industrial designer : did we decide it did not affect the circuit board , it just affected
user interface designer : so .
marketing executive : just just for the call and find thing .
industrial designer : it was just
project manager : i had speech recognition requires advanced req require
industrial designer : no th that is what , but maybe it does not . i might have got that wrong .
marketing executive : it is separate is not it ,
project manager : speech recognition you reckon then is s simple .
marketing executive : it is not part of the
industrial designer : it is it is just an addition thing it is
project manager : and so we would want it in as an extra because it does not appear to cost too much . would that be
user interface designer :  .
industrial designer : shall i pass on to you now ?
project manager : it would not really cost anymore , would it ?
user interface designer : i will just check what it said . actually i do not think it really says anything about the cost , but it says that it is already in the coffee machines , so like it is already
industrial designer : i assume it would cost extra , but maybe we maybe we will find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later .
project manager : and then have to change all change everything at the last minute . s
user interface designer : that was quick . , so very brief presentation , . from looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly sleek and sexy . i have not actually got the examples of the scroll button there , but there is some curved cases that you can see , a range of sizes . all of them have a lot of buttons there they seem to just have the rubber buttons . does that move it ?
project manager : ?
user interface designer : it just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything .
project manager : i have found that try and get it back .
industrial designer : if you right click and then go onto a previous slide .
user interface designer : it is alright .
industrial designer : right .
user interface designer : . there was not much more to say about that , just rambling . some of the remotes that i looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could where it was connected to the remote control functions . and it was quite a swish model , where it can control four devices , t_v _ , cable , satellite , video , d_v_d _ , audio . so that is a bit of competition there . so maybe it is better not to try and compete with that thing and just to market it as a completely different like different viewpoint as a finding your lost control
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : rather than trying to compete with the functions . the scroll buttons , as you have already mentioned , there is examples of those , but they do not look as sleek as other models . and there is no real advantage and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it is not great .
industrial designer : on the price , .
project manager : so you were saying the scroll buttons
user interface designer : th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , . there was children is remote , where they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b bright and colourful and you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels . but i if that is really in our field ?
industrial designer : i we are going for the biggest market , maybe not ,
user interface designer : but that is something that is out there .
industrial designer : but was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ?
project manager : we are to go for the international market rather than a local market but that would not necessarily preclude the one thing that you can often do with products is you can make small modifications . so you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , and then you could have additional features in like a you would have model one , model two and model three , and therefore you can sub - divide your market up . but that is really where your field is .
industrial designer : so maybe the children is remote should be like a next step , but maybe for ours , maybe we should
project manager : anyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one i am reckoning that we are going for the basic model to be discussed here and that you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments . is that
user interface designer : right that is something that we can be aware of .
project manager : so so what are we deciding to do here ?
user interface designer : because there is already very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a finder function .
project manager : the fi the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote .
industrial designer : so you also said for going for the international market that some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition . s s so
user interface designer : different languages might not be compatible .
industrial designer : it w it would make it quite complicated , where ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the
user interface designer : you program this one yourself , like to say like whatever you want to your question .
marketing executive : and ours is quite a cheap device , so i how much we will be able to put into it .
project manager : so you would have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature . and you were talking
user interface designer : maybe unless something else comes up .
project manager : and you were talking about scroll buttons ?
user interface designer : i think we have decided that it is gonna increase the cost and give no real kinda extra benefit
project manager : b
user interface designer : and it is gonna decrease from the sleekness of it .
project manager : alright , so we are just gonna have the rubber buttons , was that right ?
industrial designer : yes yes .
user interface designer : and just to be aware that there are specialist functions and specialist remotes but we probably do not want to focus on those like such as the children is remote .
project manager : . so not to be focused on .
user interface designer : there was a mention just as a warning about button design . just to avoid ambiguity . so it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have a v _ on for volume , let is think how they did this .
project manager : good in flip it round in ninety degree a hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down .
user interface designer : i am just gonna check so i do this right .
project manager : an upside - down v _ . so that would show that volume was going up , whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down .
user interface designer : . what did they say ? the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , somebody might look at this one and say this triangular button is pointing up , and that is the first thing that they see actually that ca not be right , can it ? , no , they might see this pointing down and think right that is gonna turn the volume down , whereas the actual button is pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up . so , be careful what you put on the buttons
industrial designer : so maybe we could have like
user interface designer : and be careful of the shape that you make them , because they might be two contradicting shapes .
industrial designer : i you mean . so maybe we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the buttons themselves .
project manager : you could have volume up and volume
industrial designer : possible .
project manager : volume up , down and like that . and the idea was to have limited it was to have sizable amount of information on it . limited number of buttons . it was sixteen buttons , was not it that were
industrial designer : we got it down to not too many .
user interface designer : and that is all i had to say for that . so what was the decision on the design of the volume button ?
industrial designer : are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , or are we gonna t
marketing executive : i have got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching .
industrial designer : maybe we should see yours first .
marketing executive : right , i have been looking at some trends in fashion on top of doing the research into the remote control market the one that is the one i talked about last time , that we would asked people about remote controls and what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . and we have also been looking at fa fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment . so we have had people in paris and milan watching the fashion trends .
project manager : yourself .
marketing executive : so just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation . the most important thing was that the thing look and felt fancy rather than just functional . and second , there should be some technological innovation . and then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as . and , the fashion trends are that people want clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme . but the feel of the material should be spongy , which is contrary to last year , . i presume it must have been not spongy last year . we need to emphasise the fancy design with on our remote control above all else . and then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our find the thing with a hand clap . and then we need to ma make it easy to use that is as a third priority , so perhaps fewer buttons and functions as we have discussed . and then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we capture people is imaginations . so maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , or the buttons could be spongy , somehow . maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than hard plastic . and then even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote , say in the shape of a banana like that . right , so that will be it . maybe a banana or courgette . how how far we actually want to go along and follow the trends , do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , or , do they not matter that much ?
user interface designer : if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use .
project manager : you were just talking about you have got to be careful how you shape your buttons , you are can mis - direct people . and i would have thought the functionality the people get cheesed off by things by having to read instructions et cetera , so .
user interface designer : maybe just one button , say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . maybe that could be a little apple .
marketing executive : maybe .
project manager : .
user interface designer : and then that would not get in the way of like kinda one to nine , and it would not confuse the numbers .
project manager : stand - by button . th that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you are looking for functionality .
industrial designer : i maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment , but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are ,
project manager : but what are they gonna be next what are they gonna be next year .
industrial designer : maybe
user interface designer : . s
project manager : but but th but you can incorporate the tr if y if you change all the buttons then you have got the problem that this year is fruit and veg , next year is i was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever .
marketing executive :
project manager : that means you are constantly changing your production schedule ,
marketing executive : i am not
project manager : and you have got ta make different moulds and everything else , so that is not a good idea i would suggest .
marketing executive : i am not what the timescale we are thinking of selling the product over is .
industrial designer : it just seems realistic that the remote control market is not the thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : to something which is maybe more universal .
user interface designer : but i suppose as long as it is quite a subtle design , even if the design changes ,
industrial designer : we c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly .
project manager : d but if
industrial designer : maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about , .
project manager : .
industrial designer : maybe still with a rubber design we could
project manager : was that in the fashion sense that this or was the spongy feel was that fashion ? it was , was not it ? so the
user interface designer : it seems like you are gonna have rubber cases , as buttons . and that you can make them curved or double - curved and that would be the sleek and sexy look .
industrial designer : one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case .
user interface designer : right , that fits , does not it ?
industrial designer : it is if you use the rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons . that is the way round . if you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it . which makes sense .
user interface designer : right .
project manager : rubber buttons require rubber case .
user interface designer : and that would fit in with what we want , would not it , for the spongy feel , to have everything rubber .
project manager : so , . the m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ? in essence in the production you want things to stay you want to mint them out if you have got fashion changes and that you are incorporating , then it means that your stock is last year is stock and therefore you are selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you would not want to do . whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle . you are just changing one aspect like the standby button like that , and especially then you could make it something that
industrial designer : i suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual
project manager : you might be limited in space , that yes .
industrial designer : would or not .
project manager : you two are gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to how much pl how much how pliable is plasticine .
industrial designer : maybe we could think of the cases like changing with the fashions like the nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . but whether that would be too much to incorporate in production , whether that would just increase the costs , make it more complicated .
project manager : so you are talking there about changing the casing .
marketing executive : that is possibly it .
industrial designer : the a the actual the look from the outside , so where the buttons would stay the same , and the general function of the remote would stay the same , but you could change the way it looked .
user interface designer : and then you could have but you still would have to have the logo on every new case ,
industrial designer : that is true .
user interface designer : but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that .
project manager : you could do a colour change , so therefore you would that is effectively what they did with the mobile phones , was to have some in blue , some in red , some in rather than all in black or , which four do you want , as long as it is black ? but so
industrial designer : so it is a possibility , .
user interface designer : but we are supposed to use the company colour scheme , are not we ?
project manager : yes that is true
user interface designer : we have not really seen that yet
industrial designer : yes
project manager : that might no
industrial designer : that is
user interface designer : it might and we might be able to do both but it might clash with certain things .
project manager : not necessarily , because you could have your company we are we are meant to be finishing up . you could have your company badge and logo . a lot of computers like on the one you have got there , it actually has a stick on badge so what you would al all you would really need , whether it , whether the casing be w any colour , could be any colour , but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it so that in a sense , with a logo like that , because it is on a white background , the only colour that it might not stick out so on would be a white casing . you are badging it .
industrial designer :  .
project manager : and a lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own badge over the top . and the way they have got that there even if you had that on a white , which is the predominant colour of the windows badge , you would still be able to see it clearly from a white casing product .
industrial designer : and whether we would have a big enough market to have this like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider .
user interface designer : if it is for young people , like the phone generation , that thingwould probably go down , and the market research has been on that side of things , has not it ?
marketing executive : it is people say that it is the look , they want the fancy looking thing but i am not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into . with the mobiles , it is the , it is a communication device , people see you with it all about and
industrial designer : i suppose , where you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time .
marketing executive : i if it
project manager : it is in the house , is not it , i suppose .
user interface designer : so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case
project manager : so do not change case . change case colour . and we are saying no to that .
user interface designer : did we decide on the rubber case ? the spongy feel , or did we think that might go as a trend ?
marketing executive : it was different last year . the trend was different last year . it was not spongy feel . but i whether the trend will change . i whether it is one of those things that like having all fruit shaped keys , that probably would go out of fashion very quickly , whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less of something that y you are gonna end up hating in a year , .
industrial designer : less likely to
project manager : sounds reasonable . if you are going for fashion trends like that they will need t you would have to have interchangeable cases
industrial designer : so then th that would
project manager : so that you could or otherwise someone is gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case .
industrial designer : it seems to make sense that we would just maybe stick with the standard rubber case , and then have the standard rubber buttons as .
user interface designer : we have not really talked about the curvature of the case . there is flat , there is single - curved and there is double - curved .
industrial designer : mayb
user interface designer : i am not exactly what these things look like .
industrial designer : maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ? but the double curve would not require us to perform miracles with the plasticine .
user interface designer : it says that
marketing executive : when you say d when you say double - curved , what exactly does that mean ?
user interface designer : i am not exactly . i will show you the remotes that i have got . see how let is just get that bigger . see how the one i am not plugged in , am i ?
marketing executive : no you are not connected to me anymore .
user interface designer : that does not help .
project manager : one one thing to cons
user interface designer : shall turn it round for time ?
project manager : one thing to consider is that in some ways you want by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other
marketing executive : that should come up .
project manager : therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other . whereas if you do fancy things with it , you then got ta put it in a ca a packaging box that does that . and the cost of packaging could be quite important vis - a - vis the total cost of the product .
industrial designer : so shall we go through quickly and just work out what we have decide on , if we have to
project manager : so but
user interface designer : it is not very clear up there , but you can see some of them have got bulges , like the second one and the end one where there is a curve there .
marketing executive : right .
user interface designer : i am not exactl i if a double curve is maybe it comes up slightly , or ?
marketing executive : that is what i was trying to work out .
user interface designer : but it is a kinda sleeker look if you have got curves in there .
project manager : s so do you wanna go for curves , more curves ?
marketing executive : shall we
project manager : we are meant to be f we are meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so .
user interface designer : definitely a single , maybe a double .
industrial designer : so shall we quickly
user interface designer : shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ?
industrial designer : we will go for single curve , .
project manager : curved or double curved ? so it is single curved .
industrial designer : so did we decide on the kinetic power supply ? the one you move around ?
marketing executive : that is a good idea .
user interface designer : and the rubber push buttons , rubber case .
marketing executive : rubber buttons and case .
user interface designer : and we do not really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we ,
industrial designer : we ca
user interface designer : but possibly a sticker .
industrial designer : we will still have the are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down ? i th we can by not having anything too complicated .
user interface designer : and the voice recognition , we can use that ca not we , just to find it . without affecting the circuit board .
project manager : yes .
industrial designer : and see we could always decide against it if something comes up that is just something to that we seemed to leave out .
marketing executive : and then are we going for one button shaped like a fruit .
user interface designer : that sounds like it would not do too much harm in a couple of years . what shape do we want ?
project manager : so we have got spongy feel buttons as , have we ?
marketing executive : maybe just
project manager : as as or w or was that
marketing executive : that is ru rubber buttons , .
project manager : so it is rubber buttons ,
industrial designer : it was just
project manager : so it is not really spongy feel buttons , it is just rubber buttons . with a rubber case right ?
user interface designer : so it is not too wacky .
marketing executive : reasonably spongy i , .
project manager : and the standby button is gonna be different .
user interface designer : an apple would be a good recognisable shape . if you start getting into kinda aubergines and things , it gets a bit weird .
project manager : so what shape are we making the standby button ?
marketing executive : apple ?
project manager : a apple .
user interface designer : vote ? shall we vote on it ?
industrial designer : we will go for the a apples .
user interface designer : anyone got any suggestions ?
marketing executive : apple apple a qu quite a big one , as .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : a big apple .
user interface designer : it could be red .
marketing executive : could be a red apple , . either , do not mind .
project manager : a red apple ?
user interface designer : we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can , once we find out
industrial designer : and then we are gonna are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple ? just like the just working out what we are gonna do for the next time .
user interface designer : that seems pretty straight forward . most of them will just be mainly circular or like very plain .
project manager : what was that last thing again there ?
user interface designer : just to keep the shape of the buttons simple .
project manager : right much option on that . you were going for a single curve and
user interface designer : just the shape of the buttons .
project manager : alright .
industrial designer : and j , just keeping the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as . fairly self explanatory .
project manager : right , so shape of buttons simple . so that is that , i . we should now go away and get these things sorted out . i you two are on plasticine duty or whatever .
industrial designer : is that the end ?
marketing executive : looks like it .","the project manager reviewed the minutes from the last meeting . the industrial designer discussed options for each of the internal components . he showed that the size of the chip was dependent on the type and number of additional features used . the group discussed incorporating speech recognition and other functions to be able to decide on chip size . they decided that using speech recognition for the locator function only would allow them to use a simple chip . the user interface designer presented several existing products . she presented a specialized children's remote; the group decided to focus on a basic remote that would appeal to a wide market . she expressed that buttons are often ambiguously shaped and that their remote must have an easy-to-use interface . the marketing expert presented trends in the remote control market and the fruit and vegetable and spongy material trends in fashion . the group discussed ways to incorporate these trends . they decided to make the standby button shaped like an apple , to use a rubber case and buttons , and to use a single-curved shape . the project manager instructed the user interface designer and the industrial designer to construct the prototype . the user interface designer and the industrial designer will construct the prototype . the group decided to use speech recognition but only for the locator function . the remote will feature push buttons instead of scroll buttons , and a kinetic power supply . the remote will contain a simple chip . the group decided to focus on a basic remote that will appeal to the widest market . they also decided to market the speech recognition component as a ""finder function"" so as not to confuse it with more advanced speech recognition components in other remote controls . the group decided to make the standby button in the shape of an apple . the remote will also feature a rubber case and rubber buttons , and a single-curved design . the remote will feature the company logo , possibly in a sticker form .
","the industrial designer presented the options for components and materials that would be needed to produce the remote device and discussed the costs involved in each component . the marketing expert discussed customer preferences in terms of features to include in the remote . she indicated that customers wanted speech recognition , an lcd display , a scroll mechanism for locating the remote when misplaced , and a power source that was capable of generating a kinetic response . the user interface designer presented existing remotes to exemplify the interface that the remote should have . she suggested that the company logo should be incorporated into the design of the remote . the project manager reviewed the minutes of the previous meeting and discussed the decisions made in the meeting . the group then discussed the features to include in the remote and the costs involved in each component . the industrial designer will work on the look and feel of the design . the user interface designer will work on the user interface design . the marketing expert will work on the product evaluation . the remote will feature speech recognition , an lcd display , a scroll mechanism for locating the remote when misplaced , and a power source capable of generating a kinetic response . the company logo will be incorporated into the design of the remote . the remote will have buttons for changing the channel , volume , and number buttons . the remote will have a scroll mechanism for locating the remote when misplaced . the remote will have an lcd display . the remote will have a power source capable of generating a kinetic response . the remote will have an integrated push button .",x,x,x,,,,,,4.0,Pegasus-Baseline
102,"project manager : so is why not save that .
marketing executive : no , you will ha have to open it up from elsewhere .
project manager : do you want to replace existing file , no . i actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but
marketing executive : you have to close that window . that is the save one is not it , so and then find it .
project manager : spreadsheet . , but i have ta right , i will just re - do it . that is the easiest way .
user interface designer : we have made our prototype anyway . we can have a good look at that .
marketing executive : you pass it round to have a look .
user interface designer :  . y no , it is a slightly curved around the sides .
marketing executive : very .
user interface designer : it is almost curved like up to the main display as . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . and we have got the stick on the button with the company logo on .
industrial designer : we also have a apple slash cherry design at the top .
marketing executive : so it is , . cherry would be alright actually .
user interface designer : it is a bit more fun , is not it ? and it is kinda not really at a you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac .
industrial designer : we might get a
marketing executive : copyright , . what is this one ?
user interface designer : and cherries are fun , summery .
marketing executive : what is that one there ?
user interface designer : that is the mute .
industrial designer : for the m _ .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : it it would probably have to be labelled mute .
industrial designer : they are thinking
user interface designer : but , we did not have anything small enough to write .
industrial designer : for the first time , it was hard to get the h the actual labelling on the individual buttons .
user interface designer : we just chose simple shapes for all them . , the important ones are the volume ones . so we made them a bit bigger . the mute could possibly be a bit smaller .
industrial designer : you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you have got the volume in orange on design there , and the channel is in blue .
project manager : r right . ,
user interface designer : and we chose a v _ plus and v _ minus .
project manager : all these things have cost implications . and so when i done my thing on cost a i had assumed that the only button that would be a different colour would be the red apple button . so however , i have now . but , so but there would be a cost implication on that ,
marketing executive : i will see if find them .
project manager : and as i suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be open to debate , i suppose .
industrial designer : sis
user interface designer : the colours would not like that is they would not be too important ,
marketing executive : have
user interface designer : but we did not have any white play - doh . so that is where the colour buttons came from .
project manager : an important consideration . right , so and the second one underneath would be the idea for the
industrial designer : yes , we will have the slide - away .
project manager : right , . so we have got detail design meeting .
industrial designer : bottom .
project manager : so , we have got prototype presentation , which we have just done , evaluation criteria , and finance , so i w we have to evaluate if that meets the various aspects that we are looking for from our previous meeting . so other than the fact that it does not have the second layer , but it would .
industrial designer :  .
project manager : but other than that , we got the red apple . we got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the colouration of the buttons ,
industrial designer : yes , yes .
project manager : and the bit after the evaluation criteria is the finance . and the and the cost implication .
marketing executive : right .
project manager : the only snag about this is that the cost is probably important . so , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to manufacture . , and whether it would
marketing executive : so if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ?
industrial designer : this this is a
user interface designer : that is it .
industrial designer : yes , this is our presentation of the prototype .
marketing executive : that is the pr
project manager : right , so as far as the finance of it would be concern would be to make that the cost aye the production cost you may remember that was one of the first considerations was to be in d under twelve fifty or two and a half twelve and a half euros . so , there is no redesign . so that should right , so , seems to me that the thing that i have to do is quickly find that
industrial designer : could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there ?
marketing executive : we should plug it in . do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the back of that one .
industrial designer : alice . so , sh
marketing executive : we could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype .
project manager : right .
industrial designer : this should be then .
project manager : so , by the fact that we have got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source , we have got a single curved case . we have got a rubber case materials supplements . so , we had decided that we are having rubber buttons and
industrial designer : have a push button interface .
project manager : . w the button supplements . , originally , there would just be one in there because it was the one red apple . but so the so the real w the real question then would come in . do you make all the buttons
marketing executive : do we will do it on the prototype ,
project manager : o
marketing executive : so do two , see how much it is .
project manager : so we have got one special button form , which was the apple . everything else is gonna be a standard . we have got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that ,
industrial designer : and then we would have
project manager : so , i was originally , i was thinking rubber was not special , but according to this , maybe it is . and the r effectively we have got sixteen buttons that we are gonna have on there .
marketing executive : you just do one , do not you , for the
project manager : w i is the answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore , what is the op the option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore
marketing executive : it is just a one . else
project manager : whereas it would be the special colour would be for the so you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic .
marketing executive : i thi the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material , rather than per button .
project manager : i would every design change is sound ] , , if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , i . we would have one special colour and one special button form . and when i plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half . as far as i know , that took care of the various supplements . and if what happened ?
marketing executive : you have just gone off the window into another one . it is on the bottom row .
user interface designer : maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right - hand corner of the little box .
project manager : now , right . , so , but the point would be that if we just did special you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : so that is nine point one there so we have got some
project manager : so it , is it s is no , it is nine point seven i have got .
industrial designer : just give us a bit of
project manager : so , that would work out fine if as assuming your correction are assuming that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . and there is nothing else as far as see that we had planned to put on .
user interface designer : s
industrial designer : i switching around those th on the electronics we got the sample sensor . at the moment we have just got the simple chip , which costs one . , i the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? we should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech
project manager : hold on . , if we , that gives us twelve point seven
industrial designer : so maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition
project manager : but remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the
industrial designer : without
project manager : i see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : . d would not you have to keep the simple chip there as ? how you turn that one to a zero , would not the chip and the sample speaker be separate things ,
marketing executive : we have to have it
industrial designer : possibly , maybe .
user interface designer : so you need both of them ?
industrial designer : maybe we would be giving up on the kinetic .
project manager : and go for battery instead . that would give you one less .
industrial designer : we should , that would save us one , though we would still be slightly ov
project manager : but you reckon that i that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries .
industrial designer : since it is the through the whole technology type thing , you were saying in the market research that people like interesting gadgets in them . , whether they would figure the s sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be a worthwhile thing to have . and then still have the batteries , or whatever they would prefer not what ? the the problem was the battery is running out and losing the remote .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : so you got ta decide which of those is more important to them .
project manager : but which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ? in a sense , at the moment , we have got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two .
user interface designer : the voice recognition .
project manager : at least . remember that was a minimum requirement . the other option if we are planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to make it originally , we are gonna make it a simple product .
marketing executive : shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we have got it now first , and then make decisions about what needs to be changed after ?
project manager :  .
marketing executive : . right , i have a little thing . so , we have all got a note of it is thirteen point seven , is not it , with everything we want on .
project manager : do you want that back up ?
marketing executive : had a presentation to do .
user interface designer : but i do think the v voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it is got no battery .
project manager : but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost .
marketing executive :  . right , this is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the prototype we have got here . and so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we have formulated . and those ones are gonna be in response to market research , and also finance , i . and do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it is neither true nor false , then that is four . so , i got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as , at the end . so , we have to say whether it is true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . the whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . whether it is easy to use . whether it is incorporating the fashion element to attract the buyer . and whether it is a recognisable real reaction product . and i have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this , so i will go over here . so the first one is , does the product look and feel fancy . so if we do a one so
industrial designer : we have a single curve , which was maybe like the feel of the product is quite good . so , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . , that would be considered fancy .
user interface designer : i would maybe give it a two .
marketing executive : of but what is one false , or is t one true ?
user interface designer : one is true .
marketing executive : i forgot . one is true , and . seven is fal
user interface designer : and a four is neutral .
marketing executive : four is neutral , .
industrial designer : so maybe a two .
user interface designer : we have not got the double curve , so we ca not like say it is completely true .
project manager : go for one .
user interface designer : but it is pretty close . we have got almost everything we can .
marketing executive : . i gonna put underneath so i have got some more space . so , false is seven , true is one , and so say about a two for fancy , you think ?
project manager : why not , m maybe nearer three .
marketing executive : d you do an average at the end , i .
project manager : two three . , it is just that saying something remember that when you look down , we have got solar power , we have got various other things you could have , and we are not going for these options .
marketing executive : this this is just for like the look . does it look fancy rather than functional . so
user interface designer : i suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit .
marketing executive : so that so sh should we go for a two on that ? and , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ?
industrial designer : deciding between the kinetic power or the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition .
marketing executive : d . so , what about the pr the prototype as it is , we have got the speech recognition on it , have not we .
industrial designer : but not the kinetic .
marketing executive : but not the kinetic .
industrial designer : like the power .
project manager : no . you ca not afford that w we took that out too .
industrial designer : no , we c ca we ca not afford both .
marketing executive : alright , so
project manager : did not you ? or
marketing executive : so it does not it is pretty the prototype as it is is not fulfilling the
industrial designer : no may is maybe about neutral
user interface designer : maybe a three .
industrial designer : plus it is got something , but it has not got
project manager : a minute . in thirteen point seven we do have kinetic .
user interface designer : i would give it more than a four .
project manager : the problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five .
industrial designer : right .
project manager : and one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . so , it is very much dependant on what you do with your options . and if you are definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that
marketing executive : right , .
project manager : the other functions we have got in are more at the the special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that is at the high end that is point six , whereas down at just special colours is point two . now you are trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you are going for the sample sensors speaker , you are then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . and and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your sample sensor speaker , and then you are looking to take out point two ,
marketing executive : s i am just gonna check my email .
project manager : which would be come from the button supplements category .
marketing executive : i am just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for the product .
user interface designer : how much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? because we did say that we do not wanna follow the fashion too much . if the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough .
project manager : interface type ,
user interface designer : and then it stand the test of time better .
project manager : plastic rather than rubber .
marketing executive : . but i
project manager : that that would make the significant difference . you could either you could have it if you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you would be looking to take out point two . so you could fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . and that would enable you to do it .
industrial designer : so it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so
project manager : ye
marketing executive : read the email again and it says it is evaluate the design as it is , so we need to think about finance after we have evaluated that design . i whether we are doing it in the wrong order or .
project manager : but
user interface designer : i suppose it is rubber as it is , is not it .
project manager : it is rubber as it is , yes .
marketing executive : so , does this need to go up a bit , we have got both the speech
project manager : we got we have got thirteen point seven and we have got it in at the moment and if and , we are going to reduce down from that . but the current one , you would say would be fancy , would be too
marketing executive : . , for innovation , so we have got the speech thing , and
project manager : i would have said about a two as .
marketing executive : do you reckon a two ?
user interface designer : two or three . i would be happy with a two .
marketing executive : . and the next one is i will have to get it back up now .
project manager : the next on , just sing about . i would have said yes . i would go for a one on that at this point in time .
user interface designer : i would say so as .
project manager : incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . , it certainly has some .
user interface designer : it is got the cherry and the sponginess .
industrial designer : it does , .
marketing executive : say about a three maybe ?
project manager : i .
industrial designer : m
user interface designer : maybe two ?
industrial designer : it was just doing it quite . , we are gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it is
project manager : i woulda said two would seem reasonable .
marketing executive : it is a two .
project manager : the product is a recognisable real r reaction product ?
marketing executive : this is
industrial designer : the sensor using all of its products , all of its buttons ,
marketing executive : this
industrial designer : and it is got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from .
user interface designer : that is a bit rough at the minute .
marketing executive : so this is about the corporate image of like new sleek technology and all that thing , as having the logo on and all that . so is it a recognisable product . does it fit in with our other products , which are coffee makers and spacecraft .
project manager : s
user interface designer : it is got the same speech feature as the coffee machine .
marketing executive : what do y
industrial designer : also it is spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age . , it depends which way you look at it .
project manager : so we are going for a two ,
industrial designer : maybe a three ? d
project manager : three ?
user interface designer : two or three .
marketing executive : two or three ?
user interface designer : the logo would be more recognisable on the actual thing . it is just that the pen would not really write on that paper . but , the logo would definitely be recognisable . and it does have attributes that other products do .
marketing executive : two or three .
project manager : two .
marketing executive : how
project manager : right , come on . that is that decided .
marketing executive : two .
project manager : right . so we are now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then
user interface designer : what does what do all them numbers mean then ? do we add them up and rate or anything ?
marketing executive : we s , we add them up so at an average is gonna be i am just gonna do this in my head .
project manager : about a two .
marketing executive : one point eight is not it . so , pretty close to a two .
industrial designer : so it is
marketing executive : so it is pretty good at the moment , but it is gonna get worse , is not it . but we have got ta try and make it does not get too bad .
project manager : two b two , .
industrial designer : so should we get so are definite was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has .
project manager : yes .
industrial designer : so we need to
project manager : you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements .
marketing executive : do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the finances
project manager : i put it back on .
industrial designer : so i this is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ?
marketing executive : i am not .
user interface designer : we will probably have to re - rate it .
project manager : yes , i would have thought so .
industrial designer : we will make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going .
project manager : so what was it , control f _ eight , was not it ?
user interface designer : it is on .
marketing executive : it is come on already .
project manager : . so , you can see there that the if you want to keep kinetic , right , you have got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . you have got the sample sensor and sample speaker , which is your big item .
industrial designer : actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , which gets us in right within the budget range .
project manager : which gets you
user interface designer : that would be fine . because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway .
industrial designer : so that is eleven point seven , and then we could make we definitely had all the button supplements .
project manager : alright .
marketing executive : different different colours , . , i was thinking that because maybe the rubber case is a bit less in the corporate identity than the sleeker plastic case .
industrial designer : possibly , .
project manager : so
industrial designer : and that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . so we would lose a little bit on the maybe
project manager : so we are going for plastic , yes ?
marketing executive : lose a little bit on the fashion , but
industrial designer : and that would now be
marketing executive : and then
industrial designer : that is within the budget . do we actually have do we just have one special forms down here ?
project manager : w there was debate as to how you would count them . you got special colour . originally i was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour .
industrial designer : and we have got enough for another
user interface designer : we should just imagine white buttons .
industrial designer : we have got nought point eight left , so we have got enough for another
project manager : we have got special form . now that would be one button , and the question was that all buttons or is that just one button . our plan really was to have one button only with a special so so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same .
industrial designer : but the but the
project manager : the other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium .
industrial designer : maybe the special colour , we have got three now just because the volume buttons are different , i we would have the ones which are blue at the moment would just be the standard colour .
project manager : so , special colour , you want three in there .
industrial designer : which we should they will still be fine for the price .
marketing executive : i thin you just need two for the special colour it is just two supplements , . one original colour and then two supplements , maybe .
project manager : that makes sense .
industrial designer : that is probably it .
marketing executive : so we only ne we only need two for that . these are moulded . the one colour is gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas of rubber , is not it .
project manager : . , i would agree with that , . and we have got special form is the one apple . the rest are all standard , although you could argue that should maybe be you were making these buttons down the bottom , i was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? was that the idea ?
industrial designer : ne
user interface designer : the volume ones should stand out a bit .
industrial designer : maybe that will be a second supplement . then there is a spe a second special form .
marketing executive : that
project manager : i would have thought that is probably about r .
industrial designer : you got twelve .
marketing executive : so tha
industrial designer : so that should still be . , that is twelve point three , so we are still within budget on that .
project manager : that makes sense .
industrial designer : so decide we have lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , but generally speaking , we have kept the other attributes to the
project manager : i woulda said so . so you would maybe put fash fan fashion at three rather than two .
industrial designer : that is without
marketing executive : so shall we do a ,
industrial designer : and specially it definitely could fits the real product what was the what is the company name ?
project manager : real reaction produ
user interface designer : real reactions ?
industrial designer : r .
project manager : i am not quite , what does that mean ?
industrial designer : it still seems definitely fit that p so that is like if that is the new age inno innovative c type company , then having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on
marketing executive : so
project manager : i would s
marketing executive : so it is w if we have put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be a different shape . like we got a cherry one . maybe other ones could be something else shaped . that would be poss seeing as it is cheaper to make them a different seeing as we have got , we have made it a special form , so
project manager : you mean of
marketing executive : and that would maybe keep us close on the fashion type one . and it would , keep it quite fancy as ,
project manager : you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , because at the moment you are making a red apple . so next year you could make next year is model the same , but have it as a whate whatever , a lemon .
industrial designer : so it is a
marketing executive : you could
industrial designer : whatever fruit was in fashion next year .
project manager : l a lemon .
marketing executive : the volume buttons could be lemons , maybe .
project manager : and that amount
marketing executive : so , we have what have we rid of . we got rid of the plastic .
project manager : we have the main thing we have changed really is the casing is not it ?
marketing executive : is it
industrial designer : that , that was
marketing executive : the rubber .
industrial designer : that was just about all . we have saved quite a bit because we have just got the push - button interface , which is by far the cheapest . so maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we have lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side ?
marketing executive : but
industrial designer : and that is like the most standard type of button .
marketing executive : so , we have got we got rid of the rubber case , but we have now s we now got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . so maybe in terms of fanciness and fashionability , we are the same , maybe . so , we could maybe put two again on them .
industrial designer : and everything else has stayed the same , so
project manager : ease has certainly stayed .
industrial designer : plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to use .
marketing executive : and what about the innovation ?
industrial designer : we have still got the kinetic energy .
marketing executive : do you think
project manager : and the speech feature .
industrial designer : the speech feature .
marketing executive : and then , the corporate identity .
industrial designer : we have cut just about the same . we have maybe lost has not it it is hard to tell how the rubber casing would really affect
project manager : how it would play out , .
marketing executive : whether whether that is considered to be part of the corporate identity , i . , it is maybe not .
industrial designer : but more the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the actual aesthetics , but but either way , we have made it fairly close to what
marketing executive : . ,
user interface designer : i do not see how we could make it any more . , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing .
marketing executive : we cou
user interface designer : but then what colour would you make the r_s ?
industrial designer : just the company logo . so maybe there is like a set design which we get printed off .
project manager : but you have got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick - on badge . so you are in a sense , you are comparing the product without the company logo . and then y but you have got the space for it to stick it on .
marketing executive : hey , what what is the company colour ? did you get told what the company colour is or
industrial designer : i am still not quite we have established that .
user interface designer : no ,
project manager : do not . but but i but in the sense that , as you saw with the windows logo badge , it does not really matter .
user interface designer : we got the logo off the web browser .
marketing executive : right .
project manager : there is virtually n the way that you frame , the windows badge on there , it really does not matter what colour it is , so long as our company is logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . fact , they have got black and white or black and silver . so , even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you have got effectively a double edging on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the product . and that is actually quite a sneaky way of doing it .
marketing executive : you have got we have got point two to play with if you really wanted to .
project manager : you could put in another
marketing executive : another colour .
project manager : in this one , you have actually got three colours of buttons .
marketing executive : or would that be t
project manager : we decided that the blue ones were the standard colour . so you were talking about we are assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . which m may or may not be the case .
marketing executive : shall we save the point two for profitability then ?
project manager : . bu but was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the other opt , on the second page , as it were , that you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ?
user interface designer : i do not think they would really need to be . if they were just all small round blue buttons , it would be fine .
industrial designer : maybe we have m
user interface designer : needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as .
industrial designer : maybe for the one they are gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and , fit the idea of what they want . and then for the more functional buttons , we do not worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it is hidden away anyway , you are not gonna see it at the start .
marketing executive : it is the thing that , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . so , if it is dead obvious , then that is fine . but if you are opening the panel and you are looking and you are tuning , then you are paying a bit more attention . so it may be different colour buttons is not so important .
project manager : alright .
marketing executive : you
project manager : so we just add that to profitability in effect .
marketing executive : so we have dropped the cost , but
project manager : right , so we are meant to finish up in five minutes .
marketing executive : same function ? it is alright . just made a load of money .
user interface designer : should not we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? we have lost the overall spongy feel . it does not seem right that it just has not changed .
marketing executive : but we said that w because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra fruit shape on one of the buttons .
user interface designer : alright .
marketing executive : le lemon sh
user interface designer : did we decide what that was , which button it was ? on the volume ones ?
marketing executive : we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones .
user interface designer : right .
industrial designer : that is good .
marketing executive : like that .
industrial designer : definitely lemon shaped .
marketing executive : did did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? or was it the other way around ?
industrial designer : you had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case . so we can we are .
project manager : so we are this way around .
marketing executive : so that
project manager : until the design team comes in and says , get off .
marketing executive : so we have saved
project manager : but you are the design team .
industrial designer : then we say it is fine , so it is all good .
marketing executive : saved two euros on that .
project manager : so what bit are we on to ?
user interface designer : can check if that is a cherry or an apple ? did we decide against the apple because of apple mac ? and did we make it a cherry officially ?
project manager : i th .
industrial designer : just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like .
project manager : drats , i have botched that , have not i .
user interface designer : so were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ?
marketing executive : we are aiming for one for all of them . m but it really has to fit into the budget , so i we just have to adjust things to get it i in the which is fair enough .
industrial designer : and we seem to have least something in each criteria . we have not completely left anything out , so as an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we have just about achieved everything .
marketing executive : most
user interface designer : so do we have anything else to discuss ?
marketing executive : what is on the agenda ?
project manager : right , what is happened here ? right , right . so we got so we have done the finance bit and the excel project and the we have done the redesign .
industrial designer : we have got the closing .
project manager : so we are now on to project process . now satisfaction with , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . so , we are actually now , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it . so what did you and remembering that nobody is just over the curtain . so ,
marketing executive : finish your meeting now .
industrial designer : we should just go through this quickly and then
project manager : i suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which i will do . so , i have to finish that page . right , so project evaluation . did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves enough ?
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : some of the divisions though between the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary .
project manager : individual meetings . how do you mean ?
marketing executive : we were finding out various things in be in - between the meetings ,
project manager : in you on your own .
marketing executive : and they did not the one meeting did not always follow on for the other one , we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you would looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you would also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , and i do not understand why it would be in separate meetings that you would do that . , you would probably present it at one like that .
project manager : the only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that . then you go away . you find out information . you then come back . you then discuss it . you then go and change things around , and then go back .
industrial designer : i suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time
project manager : whereas , this time , you are really getting it from a database source ,
industrial designer : and then diff things will be relevant .
project manager : so it is not anyway , so , what do you want to put down ? i have put , seemed . creativity , seemed . flow of information on any given subject sometimes disjointed .
user interface designer : it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . a remote control is not the most fancy thing that you could imagine designing .
marketing executive : the thing itself .
user interface designer : i ca not think of a better example at the minute .
project manager : have could have used a different example pel to increase create creativity .
industrial designer : is this go it kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on .
project manager : you have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so
marketing executive : but think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . it depends what business you are in , i . this one seems . from the website it looks it is quite innovative , but we are coming up with some bucket shop product are not we that is , fifteen quid .
industrial designer : one of those things . like , companies can have like a range of products and
project manager : i th i d
industrial designer : i how it works but i that something got sent out and have like a brief to
project manager : but the other thing is that they are i am guessing that they are trying to use this software to demonstrate how you could do a project . , m my wife at the moment , is acting as a computer for you normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed . so what she is doing is she is having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can ask whatever question . and then you or the idea is that the whichever person is at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or come back , or go and see joe bloggs , or whatever . so , and that was a project i suspect similar to this , because they were actually trying to debug the computer software to enable it to work . and , you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong . so
industrial designer : sh we look at the last slide , see if it is got anything else .
project manager : alright ,
industrial designer : there is one more to go .
project manager : so we have got
marketing executive : if you look at their products on their website here , real reaction , it is all pretty high - tech and cutting edge .
project manager : new ideas found ,
marketing executive : and
project manager : did we find any , no .
industrial designer : it was quite good with this the white board , having that and the digital pens . like , that is something that made it a little easier .
project manager : leadership , teamwork .
marketing executive : we did find a new idea , a kinetic remote control . i have never seen one of them before . so
project manager : does
industrial designer : voice recognition , especially not could
project manager : you have got voice recognition computers , that is not remote controls .
user interface designer : it is a different application of it .
industrial designer : so it is just like the same products , but just put together in a different way .
project manager : so how do you reckon teamwork went ?
marketing executive : that went , .
industrial designer : i we all had separate ideas and then discussed them .
marketing executive :  , .
project manager : to go reasonably .
marketing executive : i do not think the budget allowed us to do anything
project manager : bit bit arbitrary .
marketing executive : i do not think it fitted in with the rest of their products . , they have got all these , high definition d_v_d _ and portable seven inch d lightweight computer screens , and i am thinking , do , one cheap remote control does not really fit in .
project manager : so , we are m we are meant to comment on leadership and the means , e _ g _ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera .
marketing executive : surely they should produ
project manager : and and new i new ideas found was the other thing .
user interface designer : leadership is a bit of a funny one , is not it . but we ca not really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the project manager . you were the leader . so our experience of leadership was not really as much as yours .
project manager : now , i would much rather be in marketing but i certainly did not get this computer to work as i would have liked . however , alright means , so whiteboard so really , it is equipment .
marketing executive : it worked .
user interface designer : very .
marketing executive : comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but
user interface designer : but , i d i do not i am not i see the value in these . , they record what you are writing , and then what do you do with it ? where do you get the recording ? do you plug the computer ?
marketing executive : there is a little chi
industrial designer : so it is not just for us , it is for the experiment as a whole , so
marketing executive : there is a little there is a little chip , you must plug it into something
industrial designer : should we quickly look at the last slide ?
marketing executive : and it produces a
industrial designer : sh
user interface designer : you watch a video of it .
marketing executive : whether it just produces a big image of everything you have written , and page after page .
project manager : new ideas found , so one or two .
marketing executive : kinetic powered remote control . , what was the other one ?
user interface designer : voice recognition thing .
marketing executive : vo .
project manager : and voice , was it voice activated
marketing executive : voice recognition , . s
project manager : recognition .
marketing executive : almost . to fill in these questionnaires
project manager : right , so , are the costs within budget ,
marketing executive : no .
project manager : yes . is the project evaluated , do not forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . then celebration .
industrial designer : . is that everything ?
marketing executive : ? that we have got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting .
project manager : so we do not re so really i tried to save this the last time at twelve point three , and it did not seem to have saved anywhere .","the first prototype for the remote control was made of single-curved rubber with a total of 16 rubber buttons (some of them in a slide-out panel) with a cherry design on top . it uses kinetic energy and has a sample sensor for the speech recognition . the initial cost was calculated at 13.70 euros . although over budget , the team decided to evaluate this prototype before making any changes . on a scale from 1 (true) to 7 (false) they rated it on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (2) , technological innovation (2) , ease of use (1) , incorporation of fashion elements (2) , and brand recognition (2). changing the rubber case to plastic reduced the cost and allowed for an extra button-form and colour . the team were reasonably satisfied with the project in terms of teamwork and creativity , although they thought that the flow of information was sometimes disjointed . however , the idea of designing a remote control seemed unexciting , especially since the requirements restricted it to tv only , and the budget was too small . finally , some new ideas were also found in the form of kinetic energy source and use of speech recognition . the team have two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting to complete before they finish . the remote will be single-curved with a cherry design on top . the case will be made of plastic . the buttons will be made of rubber mostly in a light blue colour . however , volume and channel buttons will be different from the rest . volume buttons will be lemon-shaped and coloured . a slide-out panel with extra buttons for less-used functions is included . the buttons in this panel will all be in the standard blue colour . a simple chip is going to support the electronics of the device . a sample sensor was included to add speech recognition . the remote is going to be powered by kinetic energy . after changing the case material from rubber to plastic , it was debated that the loss of sponginess does affect the fancy appeal and trendiness of the remote . on the other hand , it was argued that the special colours and form compensated for that . the team were not certain to what extent the prototype satisfied recognisability of the corporate identity . they were not certain what the colour of the company logo should be and how the logo should be displayed .
","the user interface designer and the industrial designer presented their prototype to the group . it featured an apple-inspired design , with removable buttons for volume and mute . the prototype was evaluated on the basis of its attractiveness to the user , cost , and generalizability . the group decided that the prototype met enough of these initial criteria to be able to market the product . the marketing expert led an evaluation of the prototype . the group found that , although the design was attractive , its size and shape did not meet enough of their initial criteria to be able to be marketed . they rated the prototype highly on the basis of its attractiveness to the user , cost , and generalizability . the project manager recapped the decisions made in the meeting . the group decided that , although the prototype was attractive , its size and shape did not meet enough of their initial criteria to be able to be marketed . they rated the project highly on the basis of its attractiveness to the public , cost , and generalizability . the group decided that , although the design was attractive , its size and shape did not meet enough of their initial criteria to be able to be marketed . the group did not think the prototype met enough of their initial criteria to be able to be marketed . the group felt that , although the design was attractive , its size and shape did not meet enough of their initial criteria",x,,x,,,,,,3.0,Pegasus-Cons
103,"project manager : so is why not save that .
marketing executive : no , you will ha have to open it up from elsewhere .
project manager : do you want to replace existing file , no . i actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but
marketing executive : you have to close that window . that is the save one is not it , so and then find it .
project manager : spreadsheet . , but i have ta right , i will just re - do it . that is the easiest way .
user interface designer : we have made our prototype anyway . we can have a good look at that .
marketing executive : you pass it round to have a look .
user interface designer :  . y no , it is a slightly curved around the sides .
marketing executive : very .
user interface designer : it is almost curved like up to the main display as . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . and we have got the stick on the button with the company logo on .
industrial designer : we also have a apple slash cherry design at the top .
marketing executive : so it is , . cherry would be alright actually .
user interface designer : it is a bit more fun , is not it ? and it is kinda not really at a you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac .
industrial designer : we might get a
marketing executive : copyright , . what is this one ?
user interface designer : and cherries are fun , summery .
marketing executive : what is that one there ?
user interface designer : that is the mute .
industrial designer : for the m _ .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : it it would probably have to be labelled mute .
industrial designer : they are thinking
user interface designer : but , we did not have anything small enough to write .
industrial designer : for the first time , it was hard to get the h the actual labelling on the individual buttons .
user interface designer : we just chose simple shapes for all them . , the important ones are the volume ones . so we made them a bit bigger . the mute could possibly be a bit smaller .
industrial designer : you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you have got the volume in orange on design there , and the channel is in blue .
project manager : r right . ,
user interface designer : and we chose a v _ plus and v _ minus .
project manager : all these things have cost implications . and so when i done my thing on cost a i had assumed that the only button that would be a different colour would be the red apple button . so however , i have now . but , so but there would be a cost implication on that ,
marketing executive : i will see if find them .
project manager : and as i suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be open to debate , i suppose .
industrial designer : sis
user interface designer : the colours would not like that is they would not be too important ,
marketing executive : have
user interface designer : but we did not have any white play - doh . so that is where the colour buttons came from .
project manager : an important consideration . right , so and the second one underneath would be the idea for the
industrial designer : yes , we will have the slide - away .
project manager : right , . so we have got detail design meeting .
industrial designer : bottom .
project manager : so , we have got prototype presentation , which we have just done , evaluation criteria , and finance , so i w we have to evaluate if that meets the various aspects that we are looking for from our previous meeting . so other than the fact that it does not have the second layer , but it would .
industrial designer :  .
project manager : but other than that , we got the red apple . we got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the colouration of the buttons ,
industrial designer : yes , yes .
project manager : and the bit after the evaluation criteria is the finance . and the and the cost implication .
marketing executive : right .
project manager : the only snag about this is that the cost is probably important . so , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to manufacture . , and whether it would
marketing executive : so if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ?
industrial designer : this this is a
user interface designer : that is it .
industrial designer : yes , this is our presentation of the prototype .
marketing executive : that is the pr
project manager : right , so as far as the finance of it would be concern would be to make that the cost aye the production cost you may remember that was one of the first considerations was to be in d under twelve fifty or two and a half twelve and a half euros . so , there is no redesign . so that should right , so , seems to me that the thing that i have to do is quickly find that
industrial designer : could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there ?
marketing executive : we should plug it in . do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the back of that one .
industrial designer : alice . so , sh
marketing executive : we could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype .
project manager : right .
industrial designer : this should be then .
project manager : so , by the fact that we have got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source , we have got a single curved case . we have got a rubber case materials supplements . so , we had decided that we are having rubber buttons and
industrial designer : have a push button interface .
project manager : . w the button supplements . , originally , there would just be one in there because it was the one red apple . but so the so the real w the real question then would come in . do you make all the buttons
marketing executive : do we will do it on the prototype ,
project manager : o
marketing executive : so do two , see how much it is .
project manager : so we have got one special button form , which was the apple . everything else is gonna be a standard . we have got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that ,
industrial designer : and then we would have
project manager : so , i was originally , i was thinking rubber was not special , but according to this , maybe it is . and the r effectively we have got sixteen buttons that we are gonna have on there .
marketing executive : you just do one , do not you , for the
project manager : w i is the answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore , what is the op the option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore
marketing executive : it is just a one . else
project manager : whereas it would be the special colour would be for the so you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic .
marketing executive : i thi the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material , rather than per button .
project manager : i would every design change is sound ] , , if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , i . we would have one special colour and one special button form . and when i plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half . as far as i know , that took care of the various supplements . and if what happened ?
marketing executive : you have just gone off the window into another one . it is on the bottom row .
user interface designer : maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right - hand corner of the little box .
project manager : now , right . , so , but the point would be that if we just did special you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : so that is nine point one there so we have got some
project manager : so it , is it s is no , it is nine point seven i have got .
industrial designer : just give us a bit of
project manager : so , that would work out fine if as assuming your correction are assuming that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . and there is nothing else as far as see that we had planned to put on .
user interface designer : s
industrial designer : i switching around those th on the electronics we got the sample sensor . at the moment we have just got the simple chip , which costs one . , i the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? we should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech
project manager : hold on . , if we , that gives us twelve point seven
industrial designer : so maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition
project manager : but remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the
industrial designer : without
project manager : i see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : . d would not you have to keep the simple chip there as ? how you turn that one to a zero , would not the chip and the sample speaker be separate things ,
marketing executive : we have to have it
industrial designer : possibly , maybe .
user interface designer : so you need both of them ?
industrial designer : maybe we would be giving up on the kinetic .
project manager : and go for battery instead . that would give you one less .
industrial designer : we should , that would save us one , though we would still be slightly ov
project manager : but you reckon that i that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries .
industrial designer : since it is the through the whole technology type thing , you were saying in the market research that people like interesting gadgets in them . , whether they would figure the s sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be a worthwhile thing to have . and then still have the batteries , or whatever they would prefer not what ? the the problem was the battery is running out and losing the remote .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : so you got ta decide which of those is more important to them .
project manager : but which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ? in a sense , at the moment , we have got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two .
user interface designer : the voice recognition .
project manager : at least . remember that was a minimum requirement . the other option if we are planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to make it originally , we are gonna make it a simple product .
marketing executive : shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we have got it now first , and then make decisions about what needs to be changed after ?
project manager :  .
marketing executive : . right , i have a little thing . so , we have all got a note of it is thirteen point seven , is not it , with everything we want on .
project manager : do you want that back up ?
marketing executive : had a presentation to do .
user interface designer : but i do think the v voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it is got no battery .
project manager : but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost .
marketing executive :  . right , this is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the prototype we have got here . and so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we have formulated . and those ones are gonna be in response to market research , and also finance , i . and do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it is neither true nor false , then that is four . so , i got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as , at the end . so , we have to say whether it is true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . the whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . whether it is easy to use . whether it is incorporating the fashion element to attract the buyer . and whether it is a recognisable real reaction product . and i have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this , so i will go over here . so the first one is , does the product look and feel fancy . so if we do a one so
industrial designer : we have a single curve , which was maybe like the feel of the product is quite good . so , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . , that would be considered fancy .
user interface designer : i would maybe give it a two .
marketing executive : of but what is one false , or is t one true ?
user interface designer : one is true .
marketing executive : i forgot . one is true , and . seven is fal
user interface designer : and a four is neutral .
marketing executive : four is neutral , .
industrial designer : so maybe a two .
user interface designer : we have not got the double curve , so we ca not like say it is completely true .
project manager : go for one .
user interface designer : but it is pretty close . we have got almost everything we can .
marketing executive : . i gonna put underneath so i have got some more space . so , false is seven , true is one , and so say about a two for fancy , you think ?
project manager : why not , m maybe nearer three .
marketing executive : d you do an average at the end , i .
project manager : two three . , it is just that saying something remember that when you look down , we have got solar power , we have got various other things you could have , and we are not going for these options .
marketing executive : this this is just for like the look . does it look fancy rather than functional . so
user interface designer : i suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit .
marketing executive : so that so sh should we go for a two on that ? and , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ?
industrial designer : deciding between the kinetic power or the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition .
marketing executive : d . so , what about the pr the prototype as it is , we have got the speech recognition on it , have not we .
industrial designer : but not the kinetic .
marketing executive : but not the kinetic .
industrial designer : like the power .
project manager : no . you ca not afford that w we took that out too .
industrial designer : no , we c ca we ca not afford both .
marketing executive : alright , so
project manager : did not you ? or
marketing executive : so it does not it is pretty the prototype as it is is not fulfilling the
industrial designer : no may is maybe about neutral
user interface designer : maybe a three .
industrial designer : plus it is got something , but it has not got
project manager : a minute . in thirteen point seven we do have kinetic .
user interface designer : i would give it more than a four .
project manager : the problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five .
industrial designer : right .
project manager : and one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . so , it is very much dependant on what you do with your options . and if you are definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that
marketing executive : right , .
project manager : the other functions we have got in are more at the the special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that is at the high end that is point six , whereas down at just special colours is point two . now you are trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you are going for the sample sensors speaker , you are then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . and and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your sample sensor speaker , and then you are looking to take out point two ,
marketing executive : s i am just gonna check my email .
project manager : which would be come from the button supplements category .
marketing executive : i am just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for the product .
user interface designer : how much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? because we did say that we do not wanna follow the fashion too much . if the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough .
project manager : interface type ,
user interface designer : and then it stand the test of time better .
project manager : plastic rather than rubber .
marketing executive : . but i
project manager : that that would make the significant difference . you could either you could have it if you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you would be looking to take out point two . so you could fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . and that would enable you to do it .
industrial designer : so it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so
project manager : ye
marketing executive : read the email again and it says it is evaluate the design as it is , so we need to think about finance after we have evaluated that design . i whether we are doing it in the wrong order or .
project manager : but
user interface designer : i suppose it is rubber as it is , is not it .
project manager : it is rubber as it is , yes .
marketing executive : so , does this need to go up a bit , we have got both the speech
project manager : we got we have got thirteen point seven and we have got it in at the moment and if and , we are going to reduce down from that . but the current one , you would say would be fancy , would be too
marketing executive : . , for innovation , so we have got the speech thing , and
project manager : i would have said about a two as .
marketing executive : do you reckon a two ?
user interface designer : two or three . i would be happy with a two .
marketing executive : . and the next one is i will have to get it back up now .
project manager : the next on , just sing about . i would have said yes . i would go for a one on that at this point in time .
user interface designer : i would say so as .
project manager : incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . , it certainly has some .
user interface designer : it is got the cherry and the sponginess .
industrial designer : it does , .
marketing executive : say about a three maybe ?
project manager : i .
industrial designer : m
user interface designer : maybe two ?
industrial designer : it was just doing it quite . , we are gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it is
project manager : i woulda said two would seem reasonable .
marketing executive : it is a two .
project manager : the product is a recognisable real r reaction product ?
marketing executive : this is
industrial designer : the sensor using all of its products , all of its buttons ,
marketing executive : this
industrial designer : and it is got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from .
user interface designer : that is a bit rough at the minute .
marketing executive : so this is about the corporate image of like new sleek technology and all that thing , as having the logo on and all that . so is it a recognisable product . does it fit in with our other products , which are coffee makers and spacecraft .
project manager : s
user interface designer : it is got the same speech feature as the coffee machine .
marketing executive : what do y
industrial designer : also it is spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age . , it depends which way you look at it .
project manager : so we are going for a two ,
industrial designer : maybe a three ? d
project manager : three ?
user interface designer : two or three .
marketing executive : two or three ?
user interface designer : the logo would be more recognisable on the actual thing . it is just that the pen would not really write on that paper . but , the logo would definitely be recognisable . and it does have attributes that other products do .
marketing executive : two or three .
project manager : two .
marketing executive : how
project manager : right , come on . that is that decided .
marketing executive : two .
project manager : right . so we are now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then
user interface designer : what does what do all them numbers mean then ? do we add them up and rate or anything ?
marketing executive : we s , we add them up so at an average is gonna be i am just gonna do this in my head .
project manager : about a two .
marketing executive : one point eight is not it . so , pretty close to a two .
industrial designer : so it is
marketing executive : so it is pretty good at the moment , but it is gonna get worse , is not it . but we have got ta try and make it does not get too bad .
project manager : two b two , .
industrial designer : so should we get so are definite was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has .
project manager : yes .
industrial designer : so we need to
project manager : you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements .
marketing executive : do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the finances
project manager : i put it back on .
industrial designer : so i this is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ?
marketing executive : i am not .
user interface designer : we will probably have to re - rate it .
project manager : yes , i would have thought so .
industrial designer : we will make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going .
project manager : so what was it , control f _ eight , was not it ?
user interface designer : it is on .
marketing executive : it is come on already .
project manager : . so , you can see there that the if you want to keep kinetic , right , you have got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . you have got the sample sensor and sample speaker , which is your big item .
industrial designer : actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , which gets us in right within the budget range .
project manager : which gets you
user interface designer : that would be fine . because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway .
industrial designer : so that is eleven point seven , and then we could make we definitely had all the button supplements .
project manager : alright .
marketing executive : different different colours , . , i was thinking that because maybe the rubber case is a bit less in the corporate identity than the sleeker plastic case .
industrial designer : possibly , .
project manager : so
industrial designer : and that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . so we would lose a little bit on the maybe
project manager : so we are going for plastic , yes ?
marketing executive : lose a little bit on the fashion , but
industrial designer : and that would now be
marketing executive : and then
industrial designer : that is within the budget . do we actually have do we just have one special forms down here ?
project manager : w there was debate as to how you would count them . you got special colour . originally i was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour .
industrial designer : and we have got enough for another
user interface designer : we should just imagine white buttons .
industrial designer : we have got nought point eight left , so we have got enough for another
project manager : we have got special form . now that would be one button , and the question was that all buttons or is that just one button . our plan really was to have one button only with a special so so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same .
industrial designer : but the but the
project manager : the other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium .
industrial designer : maybe the special colour , we have got three now just because the volume buttons are different , i we would have the ones which are blue at the moment would just be the standard colour .
project manager : so , special colour , you want three in there .
industrial designer : which we should they will still be fine for the price .
marketing executive : i thin you just need two for the special colour it is just two supplements , . one original colour and then two supplements , maybe .
project manager : that makes sense .
industrial designer : that is probably it .
marketing executive : so we only ne we only need two for that . these are moulded . the one colour is gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas of rubber , is not it .
project manager : . , i would agree with that , . and we have got special form is the one apple . the rest are all standard , although you could argue that should maybe be you were making these buttons down the bottom , i was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? was that the idea ?
industrial designer : ne
user interface designer : the volume ones should stand out a bit .
industrial designer : maybe that will be a second supplement . then there is a spe a second special form .
marketing executive : that
project manager : i would have thought that is probably about r .
industrial designer : you got twelve .
marketing executive : so tha
industrial designer : so that should still be . , that is twelve point three , so we are still within budget on that .
project manager : that makes sense .
industrial designer : so decide we have lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , but generally speaking , we have kept the other attributes to the
project manager : i woulda said so . so you would maybe put fash fan fashion at three rather than two .
industrial designer : that is without
marketing executive : so shall we do a ,
industrial designer : and specially it definitely could fits the real product what was the what is the company name ?
project manager : real reaction produ
user interface designer : real reactions ?
industrial designer : r .
project manager : i am not quite , what does that mean ?
industrial designer : it still seems definitely fit that p so that is like if that is the new age inno innovative c type company , then having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on
marketing executive : so
project manager : i would s
marketing executive : so it is w if we have put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be a different shape . like we got a cherry one . maybe other ones could be something else shaped . that would be poss seeing as it is cheaper to make them a different seeing as we have got , we have made it a special form , so
project manager : you mean of
marketing executive : and that would maybe keep us close on the fashion type one . and it would , keep it quite fancy as ,
project manager : you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , because at the moment you are making a red apple . so next year you could make next year is model the same , but have it as a whate whatever , a lemon .
industrial designer : so it is a
marketing executive : you could
industrial designer : whatever fruit was in fashion next year .
project manager : l a lemon .
marketing executive : the volume buttons could be lemons , maybe .
project manager : and that amount
marketing executive : so , we have what have we rid of . we got rid of the plastic .
project manager : we have the main thing we have changed really is the casing is not it ?
marketing executive : is it
industrial designer : that , that was
marketing executive : the rubber .
industrial designer : that was just about all . we have saved quite a bit because we have just got the push - button interface , which is by far the cheapest . so maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we have lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side ?
marketing executive : but
industrial designer : and that is like the most standard type of button .
marketing executive : so , we have got we got rid of the rubber case , but we have now s we now got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . so maybe in terms of fanciness and fashionability , we are the same , maybe . so , we could maybe put two again on them .
industrial designer : and everything else has stayed the same , so
project manager : ease has certainly stayed .
industrial designer : plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to use .
marketing executive : and what about the innovation ?
industrial designer : we have still got the kinetic energy .
marketing executive : do you think
project manager : and the speech feature .
industrial designer : the speech feature .
marketing executive : and then , the corporate identity .
industrial designer : we have cut just about the same . we have maybe lost has not it it is hard to tell how the rubber casing would really affect
project manager : how it would play out , .
marketing executive : whether whether that is considered to be part of the corporate identity , i . , it is maybe not .
industrial designer : but more the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the actual aesthetics , but but either way , we have made it fairly close to what
marketing executive : . ,
user interface designer : i do not see how we could make it any more . , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing .
marketing executive : we cou
user interface designer : but then what colour would you make the r_s ?
industrial designer : just the company logo . so maybe there is like a set design which we get printed off .
project manager : but you have got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick - on badge . so you are in a sense , you are comparing the product without the company logo . and then y but you have got the space for it to stick it on .
marketing executive : hey , what what is the company colour ? did you get told what the company colour is or
industrial designer : i am still not quite we have established that .
user interface designer : no ,
project manager : do not . but but i but in the sense that , as you saw with the windows logo badge , it does not really matter .
user interface designer : we got the logo off the web browser .
marketing executive : right .
project manager : there is virtually n the way that you frame , the windows badge on there , it really does not matter what colour it is , so long as our company is logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . fact , they have got black and white or black and silver . so , even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you have got effectively a double edging on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the product . and that is actually quite a sneaky way of doing it .
marketing executive : you have got we have got point two to play with if you really wanted to .
project manager : you could put in another
marketing executive : another colour .
project manager : in this one , you have actually got three colours of buttons .
marketing executive : or would that be t
project manager : we decided that the blue ones were the standard colour . so you were talking about we are assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . which m may or may not be the case .
marketing executive : shall we save the point two for profitability then ?
project manager : . bu but was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the other opt , on the second page , as it were , that you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ?
user interface designer : i do not think they would really need to be . if they were just all small round blue buttons , it would be fine .
industrial designer : maybe we have m
user interface designer : needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as .
industrial designer : maybe for the one they are gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and , fit the idea of what they want . and then for the more functional buttons , we do not worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it is hidden away anyway , you are not gonna see it at the start .
marketing executive : it is the thing that , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . so , if it is dead obvious , then that is fine . but if you are opening the panel and you are looking and you are tuning , then you are paying a bit more attention . so it may be different colour buttons is not so important .
project manager : alright .
marketing executive : you
project manager : so we just add that to profitability in effect .
marketing executive : so we have dropped the cost , but
project manager : right , so we are meant to finish up in five minutes .
marketing executive : same function ? it is alright . just made a load of money .
user interface designer : should not we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? we have lost the overall spongy feel . it does not seem right that it just has not changed .
marketing executive : but we said that w because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra fruit shape on one of the buttons .
user interface designer : alright .
marketing executive : le lemon sh
user interface designer : did we decide what that was , which button it was ? on the volume ones ?
marketing executive : we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones .
user interface designer : right .
industrial designer : that is good .
marketing executive : like that .
industrial designer : definitely lemon shaped .
marketing executive : did did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? or was it the other way around ?
industrial designer : you had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case . so we can we are .
project manager : so we are this way around .
marketing executive : so that
project manager : until the design team comes in and says , get off .
marketing executive : so we have saved
project manager : but you are the design team .
industrial designer : then we say it is fine , so it is all good .
marketing executive : saved two euros on that .
project manager : so what bit are we on to ?
user interface designer : can check if that is a cherry or an apple ? did we decide against the apple because of apple mac ? and did we make it a cherry officially ?
project manager : i th .
industrial designer : just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like .
project manager : drats , i have botched that , have not i .
user interface designer : so were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ?
marketing executive : we are aiming for one for all of them . m but it really has to fit into the budget , so i we just have to adjust things to get it i in the which is fair enough .
industrial designer : and we seem to have least something in each criteria . we have not completely left anything out , so as an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we have just about achieved everything .
marketing executive : most
user interface designer : so do we have anything else to discuss ?
marketing executive : what is on the agenda ?
project manager : right , what is happened here ? right , right . so we got so we have done the finance bit and the excel project and the we have done the redesign .
industrial designer : we have got the closing .
project manager : so we are now on to project process . now satisfaction with , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . so , we are actually now , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it . so what did you and remembering that nobody is just over the curtain . so ,
marketing executive : finish your meeting now .
industrial designer : we should just go through this quickly and then
project manager : i suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which i will do . so , i have to finish that page . right , so project evaluation . did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves enough ?
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : some of the divisions though between the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary .
project manager : individual meetings . how do you mean ?
marketing executive : we were finding out various things in be in - between the meetings ,
project manager : in you on your own .
marketing executive : and they did not the one meeting did not always follow on for the other one , we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you would looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you would also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , and i do not understand why it would be in separate meetings that you would do that . , you would probably present it at one like that .
project manager : the only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that . then you go away . you find out information . you then come back . you then discuss it . you then go and change things around , and then go back .
industrial designer : i suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time
project manager : whereas , this time , you are really getting it from a database source ,
industrial designer : and then diff things will be relevant .
project manager : so it is not anyway , so , what do you want to put down ? i have put , seemed . creativity , seemed . flow of information on any given subject sometimes disjointed .
user interface designer : it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . a remote control is not the most fancy thing that you could imagine designing .
marketing executive : the thing itself .
user interface designer : i ca not think of a better example at the minute .
project manager : have could have used a different example pel to increase create creativity .
industrial designer : is this go it kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on .
project manager : you have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so
marketing executive : but think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . it depends what business you are in , i . this one seems . from the website it looks it is quite innovative , but we are coming up with some bucket shop product are not we that is , fifteen quid .
industrial designer : one of those things . like , companies can have like a range of products and
project manager : i th i d
industrial designer : i how it works but i that something got sent out and have like a brief to
project manager : but the other thing is that they are i am guessing that they are trying to use this software to demonstrate how you could do a project . , m my wife at the moment , is acting as a computer for you normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed . so what she is doing is she is having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can ask whatever question . and then you or the idea is that the whichever person is at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or come back , or go and see joe bloggs , or whatever . so , and that was a project i suspect similar to this , because they were actually trying to debug the computer software to enable it to work . and , you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong . so
industrial designer : sh we look at the last slide , see if it is got anything else .
project manager : alright ,
industrial designer : there is one more to go .
project manager : so we have got
marketing executive : if you look at their products on their website here , real reaction , it is all pretty high - tech and cutting edge .
project manager : new ideas found ,
marketing executive : and
project manager : did we find any , no .
industrial designer : it was quite good with this the white board , having that and the digital pens . like , that is something that made it a little easier .
project manager : leadership , teamwork .
marketing executive : we did find a new idea , a kinetic remote control . i have never seen one of them before . so
project manager : does
industrial designer : voice recognition , especially not could
project manager : you have got voice recognition computers , that is not remote controls .
user interface designer : it is a different application of it .
industrial designer : so it is just like the same products , but just put together in a different way .
project manager : so how do you reckon teamwork went ?
marketing executive : that went , .
industrial designer : i we all had separate ideas and then discussed them .
marketing executive :  , .
project manager : to go reasonably .
marketing executive : i do not think the budget allowed us to do anything
project manager : bit bit arbitrary .
marketing executive : i do not think it fitted in with the rest of their products . , they have got all these , high definition d_v_d _ and portable seven inch d lightweight computer screens , and i am thinking , do , one cheap remote control does not really fit in .
project manager : so , we are m we are meant to comment on leadership and the means , e _ g _ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera .
marketing executive : surely they should produ
project manager : and and new i new ideas found was the other thing .
user interface designer : leadership is a bit of a funny one , is not it . but we ca not really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the project manager . you were the leader . so our experience of leadership was not really as much as yours .
project manager : now , i would much rather be in marketing but i certainly did not get this computer to work as i would have liked . however , alright means , so whiteboard so really , it is equipment .
marketing executive : it worked .
user interface designer : very .
marketing executive : comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but
user interface designer : but , i d i do not i am not i see the value in these . , they record what you are writing , and then what do you do with it ? where do you get the recording ? do you plug the computer ?
marketing executive : there is a little chi
industrial designer : so it is not just for us , it is for the experiment as a whole , so
marketing executive : there is a little there is a little chip , you must plug it into something
industrial designer : should we quickly look at the last slide ?
marketing executive : and it produces a
industrial designer : sh
user interface designer : you watch a video of it .
marketing executive : whether it just produces a big image of everything you have written , and page after page .
project manager : new ideas found , so one or two .
marketing executive : kinetic powered remote control . , what was the other one ?
user interface designer : voice recognition thing .
marketing executive : vo .
project manager : and voice , was it voice activated
marketing executive : voice recognition , . s
project manager : recognition .
marketing executive : almost . to fill in these questionnaires
project manager : right , so , are the costs within budget ,
marketing executive : no .
project manager : yes . is the project evaluated , do not forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . then celebration .
industrial designer : . is that everything ?
marketing executive : ? that we have got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting .
project manager : so we do not re so really i tried to save this the last time at twelve point three , and it did not seem to have saved anywhere .","the first prototype for the remote control was made of single-curved rubber with a total of 16 rubber buttons (some of them in a slide-out panel) with a cherry design on top . it uses kinetic energy and has a sample sensor for the speech recognition . the initial cost was calculated at 13.70 euros . although over budget , the team decided to evaluate this prototype before making any changes . on a scale from 1 (true) to 7 (false) they rated it on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (2) , technological innovation (2) , ease of use (1) , incorporation of fashion elements (2) , and brand recognition (2). changing the rubber case to plastic reduced the cost and allowed for an extra button-form and colour . the team were reasonably satisfied with the project in terms of teamwork and creativity , although they thought that the flow of information was sometimes disjointed . however , the idea of designing a remote control seemed unexciting , especially since the requirements restricted it to tv only , and the budget was too small . finally , some new ideas were also found in the form of kinetic energy source and use of speech recognition . the team have two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting to complete before they finish . the remote will be single-curved with a cherry design on top . the case will be made of plastic . the buttons will be made of rubber mostly in a light blue colour . however , volume and channel buttons will be different from the rest . volume buttons will be lemon-shaped and coloured . a slide-out panel with extra buttons for less-used functions is included . the buttons in this panel will all be in the standard blue colour . a simple chip is going to support the electronics of the device . a sample sensor was included to add speech recognition . the remote is going to be powered by kinetic energy . after changing the case material from rubber to plastic , it was debated that the loss of sponginess does affect the fancy appeal and trendiness of the remote . on the other hand , it was argued that the special colours and form compensated for that . the team were not certain to what extent the prototype satisfied recognisability of the corporate identity . they were not certain what the colour of the company logo should be and how the logo should be displayed .
","the user interface designer and the industrial designer presented the prototype to the group . the group evaluated the prototype on the basis of the criteria set out in the previous meeting . they found that the prototype met all the criteria except for the fact that it did not have a slide-away function . it also did not include the company logo , but did include an apple slash cherry design , volume buttons in orange and channel buttons in blue , and a stick on the button with the company's logo . there was no change in the design of the buttons , which were not satisfied the project process , although the prototype did not meet all the requirements of the project finances .",x,,x,,,x,,,1.0,T5-Baseline
104,"project manager : so is why not save that .
marketing executive : no , you will ha have to open it up from elsewhere .
project manager : do you want to replace existing file , no . i actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but
marketing executive : you have to close that window . that is the save one is not it , so and then find it .
project manager : spreadsheet . , but i have ta right , i will just re - do it . that is the easiest way .
user interface designer : we have made our prototype anyway . we can have a good look at that .
marketing executive : you pass it round to have a look .
user interface designer :  . y no , it is a slightly curved around the sides .
marketing executive : very .
user interface designer : it is almost curved like up to the main display as . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . and we have got the stick on the button with the company logo on .
industrial designer : we also have a apple slash cherry design at the top .
marketing executive : so it is , . cherry would be alright actually .
user interface designer : it is a bit more fun , is not it ? and it is kinda not really at a you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac .
industrial designer : we might get a
marketing executive : copyright , . what is this one ?
user interface designer : and cherries are fun , summery .
marketing executive : what is that one there ?
user interface designer : that is the mute .
industrial designer : for the m _ .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : it it would probably have to be labelled mute .
industrial designer : they are thinking
user interface designer : but , we did not have anything small enough to write .
industrial designer : for the first time , it was hard to get the h the actual labelling on the individual buttons .
user interface designer : we just chose simple shapes for all them . , the important ones are the volume ones . so we made them a bit bigger . the mute could possibly be a bit smaller .
industrial designer : you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you have got the volume in orange on design there , and the channel is in blue .
project manager : r right . ,
user interface designer : and we chose a v _ plus and v _ minus .
project manager : all these things have cost implications . and so when i done my thing on cost a i had assumed that the only button that would be a different colour would be the red apple button . so however , i have now . but , so but there would be a cost implication on that ,
marketing executive : i will see if find them .
project manager : and as i suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be open to debate , i suppose .
industrial designer : sis
user interface designer : the colours would not like that is they would not be too important ,
marketing executive : have
user interface designer : but we did not have any white play - doh . so that is where the colour buttons came from .
project manager : an important consideration . right , so and the second one underneath would be the idea for the
industrial designer : yes , we will have the slide - away .
project manager : right , . so we have got detail design meeting .
industrial designer : bottom .
project manager : so , we have got prototype presentation , which we have just done , evaluation criteria , and finance , so i w we have to evaluate if that meets the various aspects that we are looking for from our previous meeting . so other than the fact that it does not have the second layer , but it would .
industrial designer :  .
project manager : but other than that , we got the red apple . we got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the colouration of the buttons ,
industrial designer : yes , yes .
project manager : and the bit after the evaluation criteria is the finance . and the and the cost implication .
marketing executive : right .
project manager : the only snag about this is that the cost is probably important . so , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to manufacture . , and whether it would
marketing executive : so if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ?
industrial designer : this this is a
user interface designer : that is it .
industrial designer : yes , this is our presentation of the prototype .
marketing executive : that is the pr
project manager : right , so as far as the finance of it would be concern would be to make that the cost aye the production cost you may remember that was one of the first considerations was to be in d under twelve fifty or two and a half twelve and a half euros . so , there is no redesign . so that should right , so , seems to me that the thing that i have to do is quickly find that
industrial designer : could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there ?
marketing executive : we should plug it in . do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the back of that one .
industrial designer : alice . so , sh
marketing executive : we could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype .
project manager : right .
industrial designer : this should be then .
project manager : so , by the fact that we have got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source , we have got a single curved case . we have got a rubber case materials supplements . so , we had decided that we are having rubber buttons and
industrial designer : have a push button interface .
project manager : . w the button supplements . , originally , there would just be one in there because it was the one red apple . but so the so the real w the real question then would come in . do you make all the buttons
marketing executive : do we will do it on the prototype ,
project manager : o
marketing executive : so do two , see how much it is .
project manager : so we have got one special button form , which was the apple . everything else is gonna be a standard . we have got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that ,
industrial designer : and then we would have
project manager : so , i was originally , i was thinking rubber was not special , but according to this , maybe it is . and the r effectively we have got sixteen buttons that we are gonna have on there .
marketing executive : you just do one , do not you , for the
project manager : w i is the answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore , what is the op the option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore
marketing executive : it is just a one . else
project manager : whereas it would be the special colour would be for the so you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic .
marketing executive : i thi the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material , rather than per button .
project manager : i would every design change is sound ] , , if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , i . we would have one special colour and one special button form . and when i plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half . as far as i know , that took care of the various supplements . and if what happened ?
marketing executive : you have just gone off the window into another one . it is on the bottom row .
user interface designer : maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right - hand corner of the little box .
project manager : now , right . , so , but the point would be that if we just did special you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : so that is nine point one there so we have got some
project manager : so it , is it s is no , it is nine point seven i have got .
industrial designer : just give us a bit of
project manager : so , that would work out fine if as assuming your correction are assuming that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . and there is nothing else as far as see that we had planned to put on .
user interface designer : s
industrial designer : i switching around those th on the electronics we got the sample sensor . at the moment we have just got the simple chip , which costs one . , i the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? we should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech
project manager : hold on . , if we , that gives us twelve point seven
industrial designer : so maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition
project manager : but remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the
industrial designer : without
project manager : i see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : . d would not you have to keep the simple chip there as ? how you turn that one to a zero , would not the chip and the sample speaker be separate things ,
marketing executive : we have to have it
industrial designer : possibly , maybe .
user interface designer : so you need both of them ?
industrial designer : maybe we would be giving up on the kinetic .
project manager : and go for battery instead . that would give you one less .
industrial designer : we should , that would save us one , though we would still be slightly ov
project manager : but you reckon that i that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries .
industrial designer : since it is the through the whole technology type thing , you were saying in the market research that people like interesting gadgets in them . , whether they would figure the s sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be a worthwhile thing to have . and then still have the batteries , or whatever they would prefer not what ? the the problem was the battery is running out and losing the remote .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : so you got ta decide which of those is more important to them .
project manager : but which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ? in a sense , at the moment , we have got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two .
user interface designer : the voice recognition .
project manager : at least . remember that was a minimum requirement . the other option if we are planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to make it originally , we are gonna make it a simple product .
marketing executive : shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we have got it now first , and then make decisions about what needs to be changed after ?
project manager :  .
marketing executive : . right , i have a little thing . so , we have all got a note of it is thirteen point seven , is not it , with everything we want on .
project manager : do you want that back up ?
marketing executive : had a presentation to do .
user interface designer : but i do think the v voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it is got no battery .
project manager : but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost .
marketing executive :  . right , this is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the prototype we have got here . and so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we have formulated . and those ones are gonna be in response to market research , and also finance , i . and do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it is neither true nor false , then that is four . so , i got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as , at the end . so , we have to say whether it is true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . the whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . whether it is easy to use . whether it is incorporating the fashion element to attract the buyer . and whether it is a recognisable real reaction product . and i have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this , so i will go over here . so the first one is , does the product look and feel fancy . so if we do a one so
industrial designer : we have a single curve , which was maybe like the feel of the product is quite good . so , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . , that would be considered fancy .
user interface designer : i would maybe give it a two .
marketing executive : of but what is one false , or is t one true ?
user interface designer : one is true .
marketing executive : i forgot . one is true , and . seven is fal
user interface designer : and a four is neutral .
marketing executive : four is neutral , .
industrial designer : so maybe a two .
user interface designer : we have not got the double curve , so we ca not like say it is completely true .
project manager : go for one .
user interface designer : but it is pretty close . we have got almost everything we can .
marketing executive : . i gonna put underneath so i have got some more space . so , false is seven , true is one , and so say about a two for fancy , you think ?
project manager : why not , m maybe nearer three .
marketing executive : d you do an average at the end , i .
project manager : two three . , it is just that saying something remember that when you look down , we have got solar power , we have got various other things you could have , and we are not going for these options .
marketing executive : this this is just for like the look . does it look fancy rather than functional . so
user interface designer : i suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit .
marketing executive : so that so sh should we go for a two on that ? and , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ?
industrial designer : deciding between the kinetic power or the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition .
marketing executive : d . so , what about the pr the prototype as it is , we have got the speech recognition on it , have not we .
industrial designer : but not the kinetic .
marketing executive : but not the kinetic .
industrial designer : like the power .
project manager : no . you ca not afford that w we took that out too .
industrial designer : no , we c ca we ca not afford both .
marketing executive : alright , so
project manager : did not you ? or
marketing executive : so it does not it is pretty the prototype as it is is not fulfilling the
industrial designer : no may is maybe about neutral
user interface designer : maybe a three .
industrial designer : plus it is got something , but it has not got
project manager : a minute . in thirteen point seven we do have kinetic .
user interface designer : i would give it more than a four .
project manager : the problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five .
industrial designer : right .
project manager : and one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . so , it is very much dependant on what you do with your options . and if you are definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that
marketing executive : right , .
project manager : the other functions we have got in are more at the the special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that is at the high end that is point six , whereas down at just special colours is point two . now you are trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you are going for the sample sensors speaker , you are then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . and and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your sample sensor speaker , and then you are looking to take out point two ,
marketing executive : s i am just gonna check my email .
project manager : which would be come from the button supplements category .
marketing executive : i am just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for the product .
user interface designer : how much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? because we did say that we do not wanna follow the fashion too much . if the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough .
project manager : interface type ,
user interface designer : and then it stand the test of time better .
project manager : plastic rather than rubber .
marketing executive : . but i
project manager : that that would make the significant difference . you could either you could have it if you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you would be looking to take out point two . so you could fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . and that would enable you to do it .
industrial designer : so it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so
project manager : ye
marketing executive : read the email again and it says it is evaluate the design as it is , so we need to think about finance after we have evaluated that design . i whether we are doing it in the wrong order or .
project manager : but
user interface designer : i suppose it is rubber as it is , is not it .
project manager : it is rubber as it is , yes .
marketing executive : so , does this need to go up a bit , we have got both the speech
project manager : we got we have got thirteen point seven and we have got it in at the moment and if and , we are going to reduce down from that . but the current one , you would say would be fancy , would be too
marketing executive : . , for innovation , so we have got the speech thing , and
project manager : i would have said about a two as .
marketing executive : do you reckon a two ?
user interface designer : two or three . i would be happy with a two .
marketing executive : . and the next one is i will have to get it back up now .
project manager : the next on , just sing about . i would have said yes . i would go for a one on that at this point in time .
user interface designer : i would say so as .
project manager : incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . , it certainly has some .
user interface designer : it is got the cherry and the sponginess .
industrial designer : it does , .
marketing executive : say about a three maybe ?
project manager : i .
industrial designer : m
user interface designer : maybe two ?
industrial designer : it was just doing it quite . , we are gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it is
project manager : i woulda said two would seem reasonable .
marketing executive : it is a two .
project manager : the product is a recognisable real r reaction product ?
marketing executive : this is
industrial designer : the sensor using all of its products , all of its buttons ,
marketing executive : this
industrial designer : and it is got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from .
user interface designer : that is a bit rough at the minute .
marketing executive : so this is about the corporate image of like new sleek technology and all that thing , as having the logo on and all that . so is it a recognisable product . does it fit in with our other products , which are coffee makers and spacecraft .
project manager : s
user interface designer : it is got the same speech feature as the coffee machine .
marketing executive : what do y
industrial designer : also it is spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age . , it depends which way you look at it .
project manager : so we are going for a two ,
industrial designer : maybe a three ? d
project manager : three ?
user interface designer : two or three .
marketing executive : two or three ?
user interface designer : the logo would be more recognisable on the actual thing . it is just that the pen would not really write on that paper . but , the logo would definitely be recognisable . and it does have attributes that other products do .
marketing executive : two or three .
project manager : two .
marketing executive : how
project manager : right , come on . that is that decided .
marketing executive : two .
project manager : right . so we are now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then
user interface designer : what does what do all them numbers mean then ? do we add them up and rate or anything ?
marketing executive : we s , we add them up so at an average is gonna be i am just gonna do this in my head .
project manager : about a two .
marketing executive : one point eight is not it . so , pretty close to a two .
industrial designer : so it is
marketing executive : so it is pretty good at the moment , but it is gonna get worse , is not it . but we have got ta try and make it does not get too bad .
project manager : two b two , .
industrial designer : so should we get so are definite was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has .
project manager : yes .
industrial designer : so we need to
project manager : you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements .
marketing executive : do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the finances
project manager : i put it back on .
industrial designer : so i this is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ?
marketing executive : i am not .
user interface designer : we will probably have to re - rate it .
project manager : yes , i would have thought so .
industrial designer : we will make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going .
project manager : so what was it , control f _ eight , was not it ?
user interface designer : it is on .
marketing executive : it is come on already .
project manager : . so , you can see there that the if you want to keep kinetic , right , you have got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . you have got the sample sensor and sample speaker , which is your big item .
industrial designer : actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , which gets us in right within the budget range .
project manager : which gets you
user interface designer : that would be fine . because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway .
industrial designer : so that is eleven point seven , and then we could make we definitely had all the button supplements .
project manager : alright .
marketing executive : different different colours , . , i was thinking that because maybe the rubber case is a bit less in the corporate identity than the sleeker plastic case .
industrial designer : possibly , .
project manager : so
industrial designer : and that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . so we would lose a little bit on the maybe
project manager : so we are going for plastic , yes ?
marketing executive : lose a little bit on the fashion , but
industrial designer : and that would now be
marketing executive : and then
industrial designer : that is within the budget . do we actually have do we just have one special forms down here ?
project manager : w there was debate as to how you would count them . you got special colour . originally i was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour .
industrial designer : and we have got enough for another
user interface designer : we should just imagine white buttons .
industrial designer : we have got nought point eight left , so we have got enough for another
project manager : we have got special form . now that would be one button , and the question was that all buttons or is that just one button . our plan really was to have one button only with a special so so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same .
industrial designer : but the but the
project manager : the other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium .
industrial designer : maybe the special colour , we have got three now just because the volume buttons are different , i we would have the ones which are blue at the moment would just be the standard colour .
project manager : so , special colour , you want three in there .
industrial designer : which we should they will still be fine for the price .
marketing executive : i thin you just need two for the special colour it is just two supplements , . one original colour and then two supplements , maybe .
project manager : that makes sense .
industrial designer : that is probably it .
marketing executive : so we only ne we only need two for that . these are moulded . the one colour is gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas of rubber , is not it .
project manager : . , i would agree with that , . and we have got special form is the one apple . the rest are all standard , although you could argue that should maybe be you were making these buttons down the bottom , i was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? was that the idea ?
industrial designer : ne
user interface designer : the volume ones should stand out a bit .
industrial designer : maybe that will be a second supplement . then there is a spe a second special form .
marketing executive : that
project manager : i would have thought that is probably about r .
industrial designer : you got twelve .
marketing executive : so tha
industrial designer : so that should still be . , that is twelve point three , so we are still within budget on that .
project manager : that makes sense .
industrial designer : so decide we have lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , but generally speaking , we have kept the other attributes to the
project manager : i woulda said so . so you would maybe put fash fan fashion at three rather than two .
industrial designer : that is without
marketing executive : so shall we do a ,
industrial designer : and specially it definitely could fits the real product what was the what is the company name ?
project manager : real reaction produ
user interface designer : real reactions ?
industrial designer : r .
project manager : i am not quite , what does that mean ?
industrial designer : it still seems definitely fit that p so that is like if that is the new age inno innovative c type company , then having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on
marketing executive : so
project manager : i would s
marketing executive : so it is w if we have put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be a different shape . like we got a cherry one . maybe other ones could be something else shaped . that would be poss seeing as it is cheaper to make them a different seeing as we have got , we have made it a special form , so
project manager : you mean of
marketing executive : and that would maybe keep us close on the fashion type one . and it would , keep it quite fancy as ,
project manager : you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , because at the moment you are making a red apple . so next year you could make next year is model the same , but have it as a whate whatever , a lemon .
industrial designer : so it is a
marketing executive : you could
industrial designer : whatever fruit was in fashion next year .
project manager : l a lemon .
marketing executive : the volume buttons could be lemons , maybe .
project manager : and that amount
marketing executive : so , we have what have we rid of . we got rid of the plastic .
project manager : we have the main thing we have changed really is the casing is not it ?
marketing executive : is it
industrial designer : that , that was
marketing executive : the rubber .
industrial designer : that was just about all . we have saved quite a bit because we have just got the push - button interface , which is by far the cheapest . so maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we have lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side ?
marketing executive : but
industrial designer : and that is like the most standard type of button .
marketing executive : so , we have got we got rid of the rubber case , but we have now s we now got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . so maybe in terms of fanciness and fashionability , we are the same , maybe . so , we could maybe put two again on them .
industrial designer : and everything else has stayed the same , so
project manager : ease has certainly stayed .
industrial designer : plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to use .
marketing executive : and what about the innovation ?
industrial designer : we have still got the kinetic energy .
marketing executive : do you think
project manager : and the speech feature .
industrial designer : the speech feature .
marketing executive : and then , the corporate identity .
industrial designer : we have cut just about the same . we have maybe lost has not it it is hard to tell how the rubber casing would really affect
project manager : how it would play out , .
marketing executive : whether whether that is considered to be part of the corporate identity , i . , it is maybe not .
industrial designer : but more the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the actual aesthetics , but but either way , we have made it fairly close to what
marketing executive : . ,
user interface designer : i do not see how we could make it any more . , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing .
marketing executive : we cou
user interface designer : but then what colour would you make the r_s ?
industrial designer : just the company logo . so maybe there is like a set design which we get printed off .
project manager : but you have got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick - on badge . so you are in a sense , you are comparing the product without the company logo . and then y but you have got the space for it to stick it on .
marketing executive : hey , what what is the company colour ? did you get told what the company colour is or
industrial designer : i am still not quite we have established that .
user interface designer : no ,
project manager : do not . but but i but in the sense that , as you saw with the windows logo badge , it does not really matter .
user interface designer : we got the logo off the web browser .
marketing executive : right .
project manager : there is virtually n the way that you frame , the windows badge on there , it really does not matter what colour it is , so long as our company is logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . fact , they have got black and white or black and silver . so , even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you have got effectively a double edging on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the product . and that is actually quite a sneaky way of doing it .
marketing executive : you have got we have got point two to play with if you really wanted to .
project manager : you could put in another
marketing executive : another colour .
project manager : in this one , you have actually got three colours of buttons .
marketing executive : or would that be t
project manager : we decided that the blue ones were the standard colour . so you were talking about we are assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . which m may or may not be the case .
marketing executive : shall we save the point two for profitability then ?
project manager : . bu but was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the other opt , on the second page , as it were , that you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ?
user interface designer : i do not think they would really need to be . if they were just all small round blue buttons , it would be fine .
industrial designer : maybe we have m
user interface designer : needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as .
industrial designer : maybe for the one they are gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and , fit the idea of what they want . and then for the more functional buttons , we do not worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it is hidden away anyway , you are not gonna see it at the start .
marketing executive : it is the thing that , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . so , if it is dead obvious , then that is fine . but if you are opening the panel and you are looking and you are tuning , then you are paying a bit more attention . so it may be different colour buttons is not so important .
project manager : alright .
marketing executive : you
project manager : so we just add that to profitability in effect .
marketing executive : so we have dropped the cost , but
project manager : right , so we are meant to finish up in five minutes .
marketing executive : same function ? it is alright . just made a load of money .
user interface designer : should not we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? we have lost the overall spongy feel . it does not seem right that it just has not changed .
marketing executive : but we said that w because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra fruit shape on one of the buttons .
user interface designer : alright .
marketing executive : le lemon sh
user interface designer : did we decide what that was , which button it was ? on the volume ones ?
marketing executive : we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones .
user interface designer : right .
industrial designer : that is good .
marketing executive : like that .
industrial designer : definitely lemon shaped .
marketing executive : did did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? or was it the other way around ?
industrial designer : you had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case . so we can we are .
project manager : so we are this way around .
marketing executive : so that
project manager : until the design team comes in and says , get off .
marketing executive : so we have saved
project manager : but you are the design team .
industrial designer : then we say it is fine , so it is all good .
marketing executive : saved two euros on that .
project manager : so what bit are we on to ?
user interface designer : can check if that is a cherry or an apple ? did we decide against the apple because of apple mac ? and did we make it a cherry officially ?
project manager : i th .
industrial designer : just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like .
project manager : drats , i have botched that , have not i .
user interface designer : so were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ?
marketing executive : we are aiming for one for all of them . m but it really has to fit into the budget , so i we just have to adjust things to get it i in the which is fair enough .
industrial designer : and we seem to have least something in each criteria . we have not completely left anything out , so as an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we have just about achieved everything .
marketing executive : most
user interface designer : so do we have anything else to discuss ?
marketing executive : what is on the agenda ?
project manager : right , what is happened here ? right , right . so we got so we have done the finance bit and the excel project and the we have done the redesign .
industrial designer : we have got the closing .
project manager : so we are now on to project process . now satisfaction with , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . so , we are actually now , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it . so what did you and remembering that nobody is just over the curtain . so ,
marketing executive : finish your meeting now .
industrial designer : we should just go through this quickly and then
project manager : i suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which i will do . so , i have to finish that page . right , so project evaluation . did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves enough ?
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : some of the divisions though between the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary .
project manager : individual meetings . how do you mean ?
marketing executive : we were finding out various things in be in - between the meetings ,
project manager : in you on your own .
marketing executive : and they did not the one meeting did not always follow on for the other one , we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you would looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you would also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , and i do not understand why it would be in separate meetings that you would do that . , you would probably present it at one like that .
project manager : the only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that . then you go away . you find out information . you then come back . you then discuss it . you then go and change things around , and then go back .
industrial designer : i suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time
project manager : whereas , this time , you are really getting it from a database source ,
industrial designer : and then diff things will be relevant .
project manager : so it is not anyway , so , what do you want to put down ? i have put , seemed . creativity , seemed . flow of information on any given subject sometimes disjointed .
user interface designer : it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . a remote control is not the most fancy thing that you could imagine designing .
marketing executive : the thing itself .
user interface designer : i ca not think of a better example at the minute .
project manager : have could have used a different example pel to increase create creativity .
industrial designer : is this go it kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on .
project manager : you have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so
marketing executive : but think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . it depends what business you are in , i . this one seems . from the website it looks it is quite innovative , but we are coming up with some bucket shop product are not we that is , fifteen quid .
industrial designer : one of those things . like , companies can have like a range of products and
project manager : i th i d
industrial designer : i how it works but i that something got sent out and have like a brief to
project manager : but the other thing is that they are i am guessing that they are trying to use this software to demonstrate how you could do a project . , m my wife at the moment , is acting as a computer for you normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed . so what she is doing is she is having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can ask whatever question . and then you or the idea is that the whichever person is at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or come back , or go and see joe bloggs , or whatever . so , and that was a project i suspect similar to this , because they were actually trying to debug the computer software to enable it to work . and , you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong . so
industrial designer : sh we look at the last slide , see if it is got anything else .
project manager : alright ,
industrial designer : there is one more to go .
project manager : so we have got
marketing executive : if you look at their products on their website here , real reaction , it is all pretty high - tech and cutting edge .
project manager : new ideas found ,
marketing executive : and
project manager : did we find any , no .
industrial designer : it was quite good with this the white board , having that and the digital pens . like , that is something that made it a little easier .
project manager : leadership , teamwork .
marketing executive : we did find a new idea , a kinetic remote control . i have never seen one of them before . so
project manager : does
industrial designer : voice recognition , especially not could
project manager : you have got voice recognition computers , that is not remote controls .
user interface designer : it is a different application of it .
industrial designer : so it is just like the same products , but just put together in a different way .
project manager : so how do you reckon teamwork went ?
marketing executive : that went , .
industrial designer : i we all had separate ideas and then discussed them .
marketing executive :  , .
project manager : to go reasonably .
marketing executive : i do not think the budget allowed us to do anything
project manager : bit bit arbitrary .
marketing executive : i do not think it fitted in with the rest of their products . , they have got all these , high definition d_v_d _ and portable seven inch d lightweight computer screens , and i am thinking , do , one cheap remote control does not really fit in .
project manager : so , we are m we are meant to comment on leadership and the means , e _ g _ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera .
marketing executive : surely they should produ
project manager : and and new i new ideas found was the other thing .
user interface designer : leadership is a bit of a funny one , is not it . but we ca not really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the project manager . you were the leader . so our experience of leadership was not really as much as yours .
project manager : now , i would much rather be in marketing but i certainly did not get this computer to work as i would have liked . however , alright means , so whiteboard so really , it is equipment .
marketing executive : it worked .
user interface designer : very .
marketing executive : comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but
user interface designer : but , i d i do not i am not i see the value in these . , they record what you are writing , and then what do you do with it ? where do you get the recording ? do you plug the computer ?
marketing executive : there is a little chi
industrial designer : so it is not just for us , it is for the experiment as a whole , so
marketing executive : there is a little there is a little chip , you must plug it into something
industrial designer : should we quickly look at the last slide ?
marketing executive : and it produces a
industrial designer : sh
user interface designer : you watch a video of it .
marketing executive : whether it just produces a big image of everything you have written , and page after page .
project manager : new ideas found , so one or two .
marketing executive : kinetic powered remote control . , what was the other one ?
user interface designer : voice recognition thing .
marketing executive : vo .
project manager : and voice , was it voice activated
marketing executive : voice recognition , . s
project manager : recognition .
marketing executive : almost . to fill in these questionnaires
project manager : right , so , are the costs within budget ,
marketing executive : no .
project manager : yes . is the project evaluated , do not forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . then celebration .
industrial designer : . is that everything ?
marketing executive : ? that we have got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting .
project manager : so we do not re so really i tried to save this the last time at twelve point three , and it did not seem to have saved anywhere .","the first prototype for the remote control was made of single-curved rubber with a total of 16 rubber buttons (some of them in a slide-out panel) with a cherry design on top . it uses kinetic energy and has a sample sensor for the speech recognition . the initial cost was calculated at 13.70 euros . although over budget , the team decided to evaluate this prototype before making any changes . on a scale from 1 (true) to 7 (false) they rated it on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (2) , technological innovation (2) , ease of use (1) , incorporation of fashion elements (2) , and brand recognition (2). changing the rubber case to plastic reduced the cost and allowed for an extra button-form and colour . the team were reasonably satisfied with the project in terms of teamwork and creativity , although they thought that the flow of information was sometimes disjointed . however , the idea of designing a remote control seemed unexciting , especially since the requirements restricted it to tv only , and the budget was too small . finally , some new ideas were also found in the form of kinetic energy source and use of speech recognition . the team have two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting to complete before they finish . the remote will be single-curved with a cherry design on top . the case will be made of plastic . the buttons will be made of rubber mostly in a light blue colour . however , volume and channel buttons will be different from the rest . volume buttons will be lemon-shaped and coloured . a slide-out panel with extra buttons for less-used functions is included . the buttons in this panel will all be in the standard blue colour . a simple chip is going to support the electronics of the device . a sample sensor was included to add speech recognition . the remote is going to be powered by kinetic energy . after changing the case material from rubber to plastic , it was debated that the loss of sponginess does affect the fancy appeal and trendiness of the remote . on the other hand , it was argued that the special colours and form compensated for that . the team were not certain to what extent the prototype satisfied recognisability of the corporate identity . they were not certain what the colour of the company logo should be and how the logo should be displayed .
","the project manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting . the user interface designer and the industrial designer presented their prototype and displayed the changeable fruit and vegetable designs . they also discussed the colour options for the buttons . the marketing expert gave an evaluation of the prototype based on the criteria of attractiveness , whether it matches operation behavior of the user , technological innovation , ease of use , and its ability to be misplaced . the group decided that enough of their initial ideas and criteria for the prototype were satisfied to be able to continue with the project . the finance expert led the team in calculating the production cost of the device . the total cost came to 12.2 euros , although this did not include the cost of various components which were not on the price list . the team decided to remove the sample speaker and the scroll wheel from the design in order to keep the price point close to the original goal . the project Manager led a discussion on the project process . the participants felt that they worked well together and were pleased with the tools available to them . they complained , though , that they felt constrained by the management's directives , that there was not enough information provided to them , and that they had difficulties using the meeting-room equipment . all participants were instructed to fill out a final questionnaire and to return to their workspace . the designers will fill out the final questionnaire . the industrial and user interface designers will work on a drawing of a prototype . the remote will be made of plastic instead of rubber . the change",x,,x,,,,,,5.0,BART-Baseline
105,"project manager : so is why not save that .
marketing executive : no , you will ha have to open it up from elsewhere .
project manager : do you want to replace existing file , no . i actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but
marketing executive : you have to close that window . that is the save one is not it , so and then find it .
project manager : spreadsheet . , but i have ta right , i will just re - do it . that is the easiest way .
user interface designer : we have made our prototype anyway . we can have a good look at that .
marketing executive : you pass it round to have a look .
user interface designer :  . y no , it is a slightly curved around the sides .
marketing executive : very .
user interface designer : it is almost curved like up to the main display as . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . and we have got the stick on the button with the company logo on .
industrial designer : we also have a apple slash cherry design at the top .
marketing executive : so it is , . cherry would be alright actually .
user interface designer : it is a bit more fun , is not it ? and it is kinda not really at a you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac .
industrial designer : we might get a
marketing executive : copyright , . what is this one ?
user interface designer : and cherries are fun , summery .
marketing executive : what is that one there ?
user interface designer : that is the mute .
industrial designer : for the m _ .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : it it would probably have to be labelled mute .
industrial designer : they are thinking
user interface designer : but , we did not have anything small enough to write .
industrial designer : for the first time , it was hard to get the h the actual labelling on the individual buttons .
user interface designer : we just chose simple shapes for all them . , the important ones are the volume ones . so we made them a bit bigger . the mute could possibly be a bit smaller .
industrial designer : you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you have got the volume in orange on design there , and the channel is in blue .
project manager : r right . ,
user interface designer : and we chose a v _ plus and v _ minus .
project manager : all these things have cost implications . and so when i done my thing on cost a i had assumed that the only button that would be a different colour would be the red apple button . so however , i have now . but , so but there would be a cost implication on that ,
marketing executive : i will see if find them .
project manager : and as i suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be open to debate , i suppose .
industrial designer : sis
user interface designer : the colours would not like that is they would not be too important ,
marketing executive : have
user interface designer : but we did not have any white play - doh . so that is where the colour buttons came from .
project manager : an important consideration . right , so and the second one underneath would be the idea for the
industrial designer : yes , we will have the slide - away .
project manager : right , . so we have got detail design meeting .
industrial designer : bottom .
project manager : so , we have got prototype presentation , which we have just done , evaluation criteria , and finance , so i w we have to evaluate if that meets the various aspects that we are looking for from our previous meeting . so other than the fact that it does not have the second layer , but it would .
industrial designer :  .
project manager : but other than that , we got the red apple . we got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the colouration of the buttons ,
industrial designer : yes , yes .
project manager : and the bit after the evaluation criteria is the finance . and the and the cost implication .
marketing executive : right .
project manager : the only snag about this is that the cost is probably important . so , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to manufacture . , and whether it would
marketing executive : so if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ?
industrial designer : this this is a
user interface designer : that is it .
industrial designer : yes , this is our presentation of the prototype .
marketing executive : that is the pr
project manager : right , so as far as the finance of it would be concern would be to make that the cost aye the production cost you may remember that was one of the first considerations was to be in d under twelve fifty or two and a half twelve and a half euros . so , there is no redesign . so that should right , so , seems to me that the thing that i have to do is quickly find that
industrial designer : could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there ?
marketing executive : we should plug it in . do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the back of that one .
industrial designer : alice . so , sh
marketing executive : we could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype .
project manager : right .
industrial designer : this should be then .
project manager : so , by the fact that we have got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source , we have got a single curved case . we have got a rubber case materials supplements . so , we had decided that we are having rubber buttons and
industrial designer : have a push button interface .
project manager : . w the button supplements . , originally , there would just be one in there because it was the one red apple . but so the so the real w the real question then would come in . do you make all the buttons
marketing executive : do we will do it on the prototype ,
project manager : o
marketing executive : so do two , see how much it is .
project manager : so we have got one special button form , which was the apple . everything else is gonna be a standard . we have got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that ,
industrial designer : and then we would have
project manager : so , i was originally , i was thinking rubber was not special , but according to this , maybe it is . and the r effectively we have got sixteen buttons that we are gonna have on there .
marketing executive : you just do one , do not you , for the
project manager : w i is the answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore , what is the op the option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore
marketing executive : it is just a one . else
project manager : whereas it would be the special colour would be for the so you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic .
marketing executive : i thi the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material , rather than per button .
project manager : i would every design change is sound ] , , if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , i . we would have one special colour and one special button form . and when i plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half . as far as i know , that took care of the various supplements . and if what happened ?
marketing executive : you have just gone off the window into another one . it is on the bottom row .
user interface designer : maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right - hand corner of the little box .
project manager : now , right . , so , but the point would be that if we just did special you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : so that is nine point one there so we have got some
project manager : so it , is it s is no , it is nine point seven i have got .
industrial designer : just give us a bit of
project manager : so , that would work out fine if as assuming your correction are assuming that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . and there is nothing else as far as see that we had planned to put on .
user interface designer : s
industrial designer : i switching around those th on the electronics we got the sample sensor . at the moment we have just got the simple chip , which costs one . , i the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? we should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech
project manager : hold on . , if we , that gives us twelve point seven
industrial designer : so maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition
project manager : but remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the
industrial designer : without
project manager : i see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : . d would not you have to keep the simple chip there as ? how you turn that one to a zero , would not the chip and the sample speaker be separate things ,
marketing executive : we have to have it
industrial designer : possibly , maybe .
user interface designer : so you need both of them ?
industrial designer : maybe we would be giving up on the kinetic .
project manager : and go for battery instead . that would give you one less .
industrial designer : we should , that would save us one , though we would still be slightly ov
project manager : but you reckon that i that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries .
industrial designer : since it is the through the whole technology type thing , you were saying in the market research that people like interesting gadgets in them . , whether they would figure the s sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be a worthwhile thing to have . and then still have the batteries , or whatever they would prefer not what ? the the problem was the battery is running out and losing the remote .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : so you got ta decide which of those is more important to them .
project manager : but which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ? in a sense , at the moment , we have got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two .
user interface designer : the voice recognition .
project manager : at least . remember that was a minimum requirement . the other option if we are planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to make it originally , we are gonna make it a simple product .
marketing executive : shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we have got it now first , and then make decisions about what needs to be changed after ?
project manager :  .
marketing executive : . right , i have a little thing . so , we have all got a note of it is thirteen point seven , is not it , with everything we want on .
project manager : do you want that back up ?
marketing executive : had a presentation to do .
user interface designer : but i do think the v voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it is got no battery .
project manager : but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost .
marketing executive :  . right , this is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the prototype we have got here . and so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we have formulated . and those ones are gonna be in response to market research , and also finance , i . and do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it is neither true nor false , then that is four . so , i got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as , at the end . so , we have to say whether it is true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . the whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . whether it is easy to use . whether it is incorporating the fashion element to attract the buyer . and whether it is a recognisable real reaction product . and i have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this , so i will go over here . so the first one is , does the product look and feel fancy . so if we do a one so
industrial designer : we have a single curve , which was maybe like the feel of the product is quite good . so , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . , that would be considered fancy .
user interface designer : i would maybe give it a two .
marketing executive : of but what is one false , or is t one true ?
user interface designer : one is true .
marketing executive : i forgot . one is true , and . seven is fal
user interface designer : and a four is neutral .
marketing executive : four is neutral , .
industrial designer : so maybe a two .
user interface designer : we have not got the double curve , so we ca not like say it is completely true .
project manager : go for one .
user interface designer : but it is pretty close . we have got almost everything we can .
marketing executive : . i gonna put underneath so i have got some more space . so , false is seven , true is one , and so say about a two for fancy , you think ?
project manager : why not , m maybe nearer three .
marketing executive : d you do an average at the end , i .
project manager : two three . , it is just that saying something remember that when you look down , we have got solar power , we have got various other things you could have , and we are not going for these options .
marketing executive : this this is just for like the look . does it look fancy rather than functional . so
user interface designer : i suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit .
marketing executive : so that so sh should we go for a two on that ? and , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ?
industrial designer : deciding between the kinetic power or the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition .
marketing executive : d . so , what about the pr the prototype as it is , we have got the speech recognition on it , have not we .
industrial designer : but not the kinetic .
marketing executive : but not the kinetic .
industrial designer : like the power .
project manager : no . you ca not afford that w we took that out too .
industrial designer : no , we c ca we ca not afford both .
marketing executive : alright , so
project manager : did not you ? or
marketing executive : so it does not it is pretty the prototype as it is is not fulfilling the
industrial designer : no may is maybe about neutral
user interface designer : maybe a three .
industrial designer : plus it is got something , but it has not got
project manager : a minute . in thirteen point seven we do have kinetic .
user interface designer : i would give it more than a four .
project manager : the problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five .
industrial designer : right .
project manager : and one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . so , it is very much dependant on what you do with your options . and if you are definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that
marketing executive : right , .
project manager : the other functions we have got in are more at the the special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that is at the high end that is point six , whereas down at just special colours is point two . now you are trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you are going for the sample sensors speaker , you are then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . and and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your sample sensor speaker , and then you are looking to take out point two ,
marketing executive : s i am just gonna check my email .
project manager : which would be come from the button supplements category .
marketing executive : i am just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for the product .
user interface designer : how much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? because we did say that we do not wanna follow the fashion too much . if the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough .
project manager : interface type ,
user interface designer : and then it stand the test of time better .
project manager : plastic rather than rubber .
marketing executive : . but i
project manager : that that would make the significant difference . you could either you could have it if you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you would be looking to take out point two . so you could fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . and that would enable you to do it .
industrial designer : so it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so
project manager : ye
marketing executive : read the email again and it says it is evaluate the design as it is , so we need to think about finance after we have evaluated that design . i whether we are doing it in the wrong order or .
project manager : but
user interface designer : i suppose it is rubber as it is , is not it .
project manager : it is rubber as it is , yes .
marketing executive : so , does this need to go up a bit , we have got both the speech
project manager : we got we have got thirteen point seven and we have got it in at the moment and if and , we are going to reduce down from that . but the current one , you would say would be fancy , would be too
marketing executive : . , for innovation , so we have got the speech thing , and
project manager : i would have said about a two as .
marketing executive : do you reckon a two ?
user interface designer : two or three . i would be happy with a two .
marketing executive : . and the next one is i will have to get it back up now .
project manager : the next on , just sing about . i would have said yes . i would go for a one on that at this point in time .
user interface designer : i would say so as .
project manager : incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . , it certainly has some .
user interface designer : it is got the cherry and the sponginess .
industrial designer : it does , .
marketing executive : say about a three maybe ?
project manager : i .
industrial designer : m
user interface designer : maybe two ?
industrial designer : it was just doing it quite . , we are gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it is
project manager : i woulda said two would seem reasonable .
marketing executive : it is a two .
project manager : the product is a recognisable real r reaction product ?
marketing executive : this is
industrial designer : the sensor using all of its products , all of its buttons ,
marketing executive : this
industrial designer : and it is got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from .
user interface designer : that is a bit rough at the minute .
marketing executive : so this is about the corporate image of like new sleek technology and all that thing , as having the logo on and all that . so is it a recognisable product . does it fit in with our other products , which are coffee makers and spacecraft .
project manager : s
user interface designer : it is got the same speech feature as the coffee machine .
marketing executive : what do y
industrial designer : also it is spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age . , it depends which way you look at it .
project manager : so we are going for a two ,
industrial designer : maybe a three ? d
project manager : three ?
user interface designer : two or three .
marketing executive : two or three ?
user interface designer : the logo would be more recognisable on the actual thing . it is just that the pen would not really write on that paper . but , the logo would definitely be recognisable . and it does have attributes that other products do .
marketing executive : two or three .
project manager : two .
marketing executive : how
project manager : right , come on . that is that decided .
marketing executive : two .
project manager : right . so we are now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then
user interface designer : what does what do all them numbers mean then ? do we add them up and rate or anything ?
marketing executive : we s , we add them up so at an average is gonna be i am just gonna do this in my head .
project manager : about a two .
marketing executive : one point eight is not it . so , pretty close to a two .
industrial designer : so it is
marketing executive : so it is pretty good at the moment , but it is gonna get worse , is not it . but we have got ta try and make it does not get too bad .
project manager : two b two , .
industrial designer : so should we get so are definite was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has .
project manager : yes .
industrial designer : so we need to
project manager : you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements .
marketing executive : do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the finances
project manager : i put it back on .
industrial designer : so i this is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ?
marketing executive : i am not .
user interface designer : we will probably have to re - rate it .
project manager : yes , i would have thought so .
industrial designer : we will make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going .
project manager : so what was it , control f _ eight , was not it ?
user interface designer : it is on .
marketing executive : it is come on already .
project manager : . so , you can see there that the if you want to keep kinetic , right , you have got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . you have got the sample sensor and sample speaker , which is your big item .
industrial designer : actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , which gets us in right within the budget range .
project manager : which gets you
user interface designer : that would be fine . because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway .
industrial designer : so that is eleven point seven , and then we could make we definitely had all the button supplements .
project manager : alright .
marketing executive : different different colours , . , i was thinking that because maybe the rubber case is a bit less in the corporate identity than the sleeker plastic case .
industrial designer : possibly , .
project manager : so
industrial designer : and that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . so we would lose a little bit on the maybe
project manager : so we are going for plastic , yes ?
marketing executive : lose a little bit on the fashion , but
industrial designer : and that would now be
marketing executive : and then
industrial designer : that is within the budget . do we actually have do we just have one special forms down here ?
project manager : w there was debate as to how you would count them . you got special colour . originally i was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour .
industrial designer : and we have got enough for another
user interface designer : we should just imagine white buttons .
industrial designer : we have got nought point eight left , so we have got enough for another
project manager : we have got special form . now that would be one button , and the question was that all buttons or is that just one button . our plan really was to have one button only with a special so so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same .
industrial designer : but the but the
project manager : the other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium .
industrial designer : maybe the special colour , we have got three now just because the volume buttons are different , i we would have the ones which are blue at the moment would just be the standard colour .
project manager : so , special colour , you want three in there .
industrial designer : which we should they will still be fine for the price .
marketing executive : i thin you just need two for the special colour it is just two supplements , . one original colour and then two supplements , maybe .
project manager : that makes sense .
industrial designer : that is probably it .
marketing executive : so we only ne we only need two for that . these are moulded . the one colour is gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas of rubber , is not it .
project manager : . , i would agree with that , . and we have got special form is the one apple . the rest are all standard , although you could argue that should maybe be you were making these buttons down the bottom , i was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? was that the idea ?
industrial designer : ne
user interface designer : the volume ones should stand out a bit .
industrial designer : maybe that will be a second supplement . then there is a spe a second special form .
marketing executive : that
project manager : i would have thought that is probably about r .
industrial designer : you got twelve .
marketing executive : so tha
industrial designer : so that should still be . , that is twelve point three , so we are still within budget on that .
project manager : that makes sense .
industrial designer : so decide we have lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , but generally speaking , we have kept the other attributes to the
project manager : i woulda said so . so you would maybe put fash fan fashion at three rather than two .
industrial designer : that is without
marketing executive : so shall we do a ,
industrial designer : and specially it definitely could fits the real product what was the what is the company name ?
project manager : real reaction produ
user interface designer : real reactions ?
industrial designer : r .
project manager : i am not quite , what does that mean ?
industrial designer : it still seems definitely fit that p so that is like if that is the new age inno innovative c type company , then having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on
marketing executive : so
project manager : i would s
marketing executive : so it is w if we have put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be a different shape . like we got a cherry one . maybe other ones could be something else shaped . that would be poss seeing as it is cheaper to make them a different seeing as we have got , we have made it a special form , so
project manager : you mean of
marketing executive : and that would maybe keep us close on the fashion type one . and it would , keep it quite fancy as ,
project manager : you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , because at the moment you are making a red apple . so next year you could make next year is model the same , but have it as a whate whatever , a lemon .
industrial designer : so it is a
marketing executive : you could
industrial designer : whatever fruit was in fashion next year .
project manager : l a lemon .
marketing executive : the volume buttons could be lemons , maybe .
project manager : and that amount
marketing executive : so , we have what have we rid of . we got rid of the plastic .
project manager : we have the main thing we have changed really is the casing is not it ?
marketing executive : is it
industrial designer : that , that was
marketing executive : the rubber .
industrial designer : that was just about all . we have saved quite a bit because we have just got the push - button interface , which is by far the cheapest . so maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we have lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side ?
marketing executive : but
industrial designer : and that is like the most standard type of button .
marketing executive : so , we have got we got rid of the rubber case , but we have now s we now got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . so maybe in terms of fanciness and fashionability , we are the same , maybe . so , we could maybe put two again on them .
industrial designer : and everything else has stayed the same , so
project manager : ease has certainly stayed .
industrial designer : plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to use .
marketing executive : and what about the innovation ?
industrial designer : we have still got the kinetic energy .
marketing executive : do you think
project manager : and the speech feature .
industrial designer : the speech feature .
marketing executive : and then , the corporate identity .
industrial designer : we have cut just about the same . we have maybe lost has not it it is hard to tell how the rubber casing would really affect
project manager : how it would play out , .
marketing executive : whether whether that is considered to be part of the corporate identity , i . , it is maybe not .
industrial designer : but more the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the actual aesthetics , but but either way , we have made it fairly close to what
marketing executive : . ,
user interface designer : i do not see how we could make it any more . , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing .
marketing executive : we cou
user interface designer : but then what colour would you make the r_s ?
industrial designer : just the company logo . so maybe there is like a set design which we get printed off .
project manager : but you have got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick - on badge . so you are in a sense , you are comparing the product without the company logo . and then y but you have got the space for it to stick it on .
marketing executive : hey , what what is the company colour ? did you get told what the company colour is or
industrial designer : i am still not quite we have established that .
user interface designer : no ,
project manager : do not . but but i but in the sense that , as you saw with the windows logo badge , it does not really matter .
user interface designer : we got the logo off the web browser .
marketing executive : right .
project manager : there is virtually n the way that you frame , the windows badge on there , it really does not matter what colour it is , so long as our company is logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . fact , they have got black and white or black and silver . so , even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you have got effectively a double edging on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the product . and that is actually quite a sneaky way of doing it .
marketing executive : you have got we have got point two to play with if you really wanted to .
project manager : you could put in another
marketing executive : another colour .
project manager : in this one , you have actually got three colours of buttons .
marketing executive : or would that be t
project manager : we decided that the blue ones were the standard colour . so you were talking about we are assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . which m may or may not be the case .
marketing executive : shall we save the point two for profitability then ?
project manager : . bu but was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the other opt , on the second page , as it were , that you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ?
user interface designer : i do not think they would really need to be . if they were just all small round blue buttons , it would be fine .
industrial designer : maybe we have m
user interface designer : needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as .
industrial designer : maybe for the one they are gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and , fit the idea of what they want . and then for the more functional buttons , we do not worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it is hidden away anyway , you are not gonna see it at the start .
marketing executive : it is the thing that , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . so , if it is dead obvious , then that is fine . but if you are opening the panel and you are looking and you are tuning , then you are paying a bit more attention . so it may be different colour buttons is not so important .
project manager : alright .
marketing executive : you
project manager : so we just add that to profitability in effect .
marketing executive : so we have dropped the cost , but
project manager : right , so we are meant to finish up in five minutes .
marketing executive : same function ? it is alright . just made a load of money .
user interface designer : should not we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? we have lost the overall spongy feel . it does not seem right that it just has not changed .
marketing executive : but we said that w because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra fruit shape on one of the buttons .
user interface designer : alright .
marketing executive : le lemon sh
user interface designer : did we decide what that was , which button it was ? on the volume ones ?
marketing executive : we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones .
user interface designer : right .
industrial designer : that is good .
marketing executive : like that .
industrial designer : definitely lemon shaped .
marketing executive : did did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? or was it the other way around ?
industrial designer : you had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case . so we can we are .
project manager : so we are this way around .
marketing executive : so that
project manager : until the design team comes in and says , get off .
marketing executive : so we have saved
project manager : but you are the design team .
industrial designer : then we say it is fine , so it is all good .
marketing executive : saved two euros on that .
project manager : so what bit are we on to ?
user interface designer : can check if that is a cherry or an apple ? did we decide against the apple because of apple mac ? and did we make it a cherry officially ?
project manager : i th .
industrial designer : just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like .
project manager : drats , i have botched that , have not i .
user interface designer : so were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ?
marketing executive : we are aiming for one for all of them . m but it really has to fit into the budget , so i we just have to adjust things to get it i in the which is fair enough .
industrial designer : and we seem to have least something in each criteria . we have not completely left anything out , so as an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we have just about achieved everything .
marketing executive : most
user interface designer : so do we have anything else to discuss ?
marketing executive : what is on the agenda ?
project manager : right , what is happened here ? right , right . so we got so we have done the finance bit and the excel project and the we have done the redesign .
industrial designer : we have got the closing .
project manager : so we are now on to project process . now satisfaction with , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . so , we are actually now , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it . so what did you and remembering that nobody is just over the curtain . so ,
marketing executive : finish your meeting now .
industrial designer : we should just go through this quickly and then
project manager : i suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which i will do . so , i have to finish that page . right , so project evaluation . did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves enough ?
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : some of the divisions though between the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary .
project manager : individual meetings . how do you mean ?
marketing executive : we were finding out various things in be in - between the meetings ,
project manager : in you on your own .
marketing executive : and they did not the one meeting did not always follow on for the other one , we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you would looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you would also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , and i do not understand why it would be in separate meetings that you would do that . , you would probably present it at one like that .
project manager : the only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that . then you go away . you find out information . you then come back . you then discuss it . you then go and change things around , and then go back .
industrial designer : i suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time
project manager : whereas , this time , you are really getting it from a database source ,
industrial designer : and then diff things will be relevant .
project manager : so it is not anyway , so , what do you want to put down ? i have put , seemed . creativity , seemed . flow of information on any given subject sometimes disjointed .
user interface designer : it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . a remote control is not the most fancy thing that you could imagine designing .
marketing executive : the thing itself .
user interface designer : i ca not think of a better example at the minute .
project manager : have could have used a different example pel to increase create creativity .
industrial designer : is this go it kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on .
project manager : you have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so
marketing executive : but think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . it depends what business you are in , i . this one seems . from the website it looks it is quite innovative , but we are coming up with some bucket shop product are not we that is , fifteen quid .
industrial designer : one of those things . like , companies can have like a range of products and
project manager : i th i d
industrial designer : i how it works but i that something got sent out and have like a brief to
project manager : but the other thing is that they are i am guessing that they are trying to use this software to demonstrate how you could do a project . , m my wife at the moment , is acting as a computer for you normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed . so what she is doing is she is having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can ask whatever question . and then you or the idea is that the whichever person is at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or come back , or go and see joe bloggs , or whatever . so , and that was a project i suspect similar to this , because they were actually trying to debug the computer software to enable it to work . and , you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong . so
industrial designer : sh we look at the last slide , see if it is got anything else .
project manager : alright ,
industrial designer : there is one more to go .
project manager : so we have got
marketing executive : if you look at their products on their website here , real reaction , it is all pretty high - tech and cutting edge .
project manager : new ideas found ,
marketing executive : and
project manager : did we find any , no .
industrial designer : it was quite good with this the white board , having that and the digital pens . like , that is something that made it a little easier .
project manager : leadership , teamwork .
marketing executive : we did find a new idea , a kinetic remote control . i have never seen one of them before . so
project manager : does
industrial designer : voice recognition , especially not could
project manager : you have got voice recognition computers , that is not remote controls .
user interface designer : it is a different application of it .
industrial designer : so it is just like the same products , but just put together in a different way .
project manager : so how do you reckon teamwork went ?
marketing executive : that went , .
industrial designer : i we all had separate ideas and then discussed them .
marketing executive :  , .
project manager : to go reasonably .
marketing executive : i do not think the budget allowed us to do anything
project manager : bit bit arbitrary .
marketing executive : i do not think it fitted in with the rest of their products . , they have got all these , high definition d_v_d _ and portable seven inch d lightweight computer screens , and i am thinking , do , one cheap remote control does not really fit in .
project manager : so , we are m we are meant to comment on leadership and the means , e _ g _ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera .
marketing executive : surely they should produ
project manager : and and new i new ideas found was the other thing .
user interface designer : leadership is a bit of a funny one , is not it . but we ca not really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the project manager . you were the leader . so our experience of leadership was not really as much as yours .
project manager : now , i would much rather be in marketing but i certainly did not get this computer to work as i would have liked . however , alright means , so whiteboard so really , it is equipment .
marketing executive : it worked .
user interface designer : very .
marketing executive : comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but
user interface designer : but , i d i do not i am not i see the value in these . , they record what you are writing , and then what do you do with it ? where do you get the recording ? do you plug the computer ?
marketing executive : there is a little chi
industrial designer : so it is not just for us , it is for the experiment as a whole , so
marketing executive : there is a little there is a little chip , you must plug it into something
industrial designer : should we quickly look at the last slide ?
marketing executive : and it produces a
industrial designer : sh
user interface designer : you watch a video of it .
marketing executive : whether it just produces a big image of everything you have written , and page after page .
project manager : new ideas found , so one or two .
marketing executive : kinetic powered remote control . , what was the other one ?
user interface designer : voice recognition thing .
marketing executive : vo .
project manager : and voice , was it voice activated
marketing executive : voice recognition , . s
project manager : recognition .
marketing executive : almost . to fill in these questionnaires
project manager : right , so , are the costs within budget ,
marketing executive : no .
project manager : yes . is the project evaluated , do not forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . then celebration .
industrial designer : . is that everything ?
marketing executive : ? that we have got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting .
project manager : so we do not re so really i tried to save this the last time at twelve point three , and it did not seem to have saved anywhere .","the first prototype for the remote control was made of single-curved rubber with a total of 16 rubber buttons (some of them in a slide-out panel) with a cherry design on top . it uses kinetic energy and has a sample sensor for the speech recognition . the initial cost was calculated at 13.70 euros . although over budget , the team decided to evaluate this prototype before making any changes . on a scale from 1 (true) to 7 (false) they rated it on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (2) , technological innovation (2) , ease of use (1) , incorporation of fashion elements (2) , and brand recognition (2). changing the rubber case to plastic reduced the cost and allowed for an extra button-form and colour . the team were reasonably satisfied with the project in terms of teamwork and creativity , although they thought that the flow of information was sometimes disjointed . however , the idea of designing a remote control seemed unexciting , especially since the requirements restricted it to tv only , and the budget was too small . finally , some new ideas were also found in the form of kinetic energy source and use of speech recognition . the team have two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting to complete before they finish . the remote will be single-curved with a cherry design on top . the case will be made of plastic . the buttons will be made of rubber mostly in a light blue colour . however , volume and channel buttons will be different from the rest . volume buttons will be lemon-shaped and coloured . a slide-out panel with extra buttons for less-used functions is included . the buttons in this panel will all be in the standard blue colour . a simple chip is going to support the electronics of the device . a sample sensor was included to add speech recognition . the remote is going to be powered by kinetic energy . after changing the case material from rubber to plastic , it was debated that the loss of sponginess does affect the fancy appeal and trendiness of the remote . on the other hand , it was argued that the special colours and form compensated for that . the team were not certain to what extent the prototype satisfied recognisability of the corporate identity . they were not certain what the colour of the company logo should be and how the logo should be displayed .
","the user interface designer and the industrial designer presented the prototype to the group . they displayed the prototype at the front of the device , with the company logo at the top , and two cherry-shaped buttons . the group discussed the options for buttons , including one with a curved shape , which may be shaped like an apple , or one that is more fruit-themed . their group discussed whether to include a second layer of plastic for the back button . after a discussion on the merits of the prototype , the project manager went over the requirements for the device and found that it met all of the criteria established that the project had very good quality and design , although this did not have enough resources to be able to be fruit and vegetables in which they had difficulties with getting the necessary information from their computer and marketing expert advising them to write up their product evaluation . all participants were instructed to write down their initial criteria in order to have a final report at the end of the meeting and to complete the final questionnaire . each participant will write up his/her presentation and the final report the group decided that the prototype will be double-curved . there will be extra buttons plus and a cherry-themed remote . it will be made of rubber , so that the curved , in orange and blue and red apples , but not be enough material to write in small letters to help people understand the project process .",x,,x,,,x,x,,1.0,T5-Cons
106,"project manager : so is why not save that .
marketing executive : no , you will ha have to open it up from elsewhere .
project manager : do you want to replace existing file , no . i actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but
marketing executive : you have to close that window . that is the save one is not it , so and then find it .
project manager : spreadsheet . , but i have ta right , i will just re - do it . that is the easiest way .
user interface designer : we have made our prototype anyway . we can have a good look at that .
marketing executive : you pass it round to have a look .
user interface designer :  . y no , it is a slightly curved around the sides .
marketing executive : very .
user interface designer : it is almost curved like up to the main display as . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . and we have got the stick on the button with the company logo on .
industrial designer : we also have a apple slash cherry design at the top .
marketing executive : so it is , . cherry would be alright actually .
user interface designer : it is a bit more fun , is not it ? and it is kinda not really at a you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac .
industrial designer : we might get a
marketing executive : copyright , . what is this one ?
user interface designer : and cherries are fun , summery .
marketing executive : what is that one there ?
user interface designer : that is the mute .
industrial designer : for the m _ .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : it it would probably have to be labelled mute .
industrial designer : they are thinking
user interface designer : but , we did not have anything small enough to write .
industrial designer : for the first time , it was hard to get the h the actual labelling on the individual buttons .
user interface designer : we just chose simple shapes for all them . , the important ones are the volume ones . so we made them a bit bigger . the mute could possibly be a bit smaller .
industrial designer : you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you have got the volume in orange on design there , and the channel is in blue .
project manager : r right . ,
user interface designer : and we chose a v _ plus and v _ minus .
project manager : all these things have cost implications . and so when i done my thing on cost a i had assumed that the only button that would be a different colour would be the red apple button . so however , i have now . but , so but there would be a cost implication on that ,
marketing executive : i will see if find them .
project manager : and as i suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be open to debate , i suppose .
industrial designer : sis
user interface designer : the colours would not like that is they would not be too important ,
marketing executive : have
user interface designer : but we did not have any white play - doh . so that is where the colour buttons came from .
project manager : an important consideration . right , so and the second one underneath would be the idea for the
industrial designer : yes , we will have the slide - away .
project manager : right , . so we have got detail design meeting .
industrial designer : bottom .
project manager : so , we have got prototype presentation , which we have just done , evaluation criteria , and finance , so i w we have to evaluate if that meets the various aspects that we are looking for from our previous meeting . so other than the fact that it does not have the second layer , but it would .
industrial designer :  .
project manager : but other than that , we got the red apple . we got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the colouration of the buttons ,
industrial designer : yes , yes .
project manager : and the bit after the evaluation criteria is the finance . and the and the cost implication .
marketing executive : right .
project manager : the only snag about this is that the cost is probably important . so , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to manufacture . , and whether it would
marketing executive : so if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ?
industrial designer : this this is a
user interface designer : that is it .
industrial designer : yes , this is our presentation of the prototype .
marketing executive : that is the pr
project manager : right , so as far as the finance of it would be concern would be to make that the cost aye the production cost you may remember that was one of the first considerations was to be in d under twelve fifty or two and a half twelve and a half euros . so , there is no redesign . so that should right , so , seems to me that the thing that i have to do is quickly find that
industrial designer : could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there ?
marketing executive : we should plug it in . do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the back of that one .
industrial designer : alice . so , sh
marketing executive : we could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype .
project manager : right .
industrial designer : this should be then .
project manager : so , by the fact that we have got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source , we have got a single curved case . we have got a rubber case materials supplements . so , we had decided that we are having rubber buttons and
industrial designer : have a push button interface .
project manager : . w the button supplements . , originally , there would just be one in there because it was the one red apple . but so the so the real w the real question then would come in . do you make all the buttons
marketing executive : do we will do it on the prototype ,
project manager : o
marketing executive : so do two , see how much it is .
project manager : so we have got one special button form , which was the apple . everything else is gonna be a standard . we have got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that ,
industrial designer : and then we would have
project manager : so , i was originally , i was thinking rubber was not special , but according to this , maybe it is . and the r effectively we have got sixteen buttons that we are gonna have on there .
marketing executive : you just do one , do not you , for the
project manager : w i is the answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore , what is the op the option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore
marketing executive : it is just a one . else
project manager : whereas it would be the special colour would be for the so you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic .
marketing executive : i thi the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material , rather than per button .
project manager : i would every design change is sound ] , , if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , i . we would have one special colour and one special button form . and when i plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half . as far as i know , that took care of the various supplements . and if what happened ?
marketing executive : you have just gone off the window into another one . it is on the bottom row .
user interface designer : maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right - hand corner of the little box .
project manager : now , right . , so , but the point would be that if we just did special you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : so that is nine point one there so we have got some
project manager : so it , is it s is no , it is nine point seven i have got .
industrial designer : just give us a bit of
project manager : so , that would work out fine if as assuming your correction are assuming that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . and there is nothing else as far as see that we had planned to put on .
user interface designer : s
industrial designer : i switching around those th on the electronics we got the sample sensor . at the moment we have just got the simple chip , which costs one . , i the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? we should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech
project manager : hold on . , if we , that gives us twelve point seven
industrial designer : so maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition
project manager : but remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the
industrial designer : without
project manager : i see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : . d would not you have to keep the simple chip there as ? how you turn that one to a zero , would not the chip and the sample speaker be separate things ,
marketing executive : we have to have it
industrial designer : possibly , maybe .
user interface designer : so you need both of them ?
industrial designer : maybe we would be giving up on the kinetic .
project manager : and go for battery instead . that would give you one less .
industrial designer : we should , that would save us one , though we would still be slightly ov
project manager : but you reckon that i that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries .
industrial designer : since it is the through the whole technology type thing , you were saying in the market research that people like interesting gadgets in them . , whether they would figure the s sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be a worthwhile thing to have . and then still have the batteries , or whatever they would prefer not what ? the the problem was the battery is running out and losing the remote .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : so you got ta decide which of those is more important to them .
project manager : but which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ? in a sense , at the moment , we have got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two .
user interface designer : the voice recognition .
project manager : at least . remember that was a minimum requirement . the other option if we are planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to make it originally , we are gonna make it a simple product .
marketing executive : shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we have got it now first , and then make decisions about what needs to be changed after ?
project manager :  .
marketing executive : . right , i have a little thing . so , we have all got a note of it is thirteen point seven , is not it , with everything we want on .
project manager : do you want that back up ?
marketing executive : had a presentation to do .
user interface designer : but i do think the v voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it is got no battery .
project manager : but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost .
marketing executive :  . right , this is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the prototype we have got here . and so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we have formulated . and those ones are gonna be in response to market research , and also finance , i . and do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it is neither true nor false , then that is four . so , i got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as , at the end . so , we have to say whether it is true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . the whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . whether it is easy to use . whether it is incorporating the fashion element to attract the buyer . and whether it is a recognisable real reaction product . and i have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this , so i will go over here . so the first one is , does the product look and feel fancy . so if we do a one so
industrial designer : we have a single curve , which was maybe like the feel of the product is quite good . so , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . , that would be considered fancy .
user interface designer : i would maybe give it a two .
marketing executive : of but what is one false , or is t one true ?
user interface designer : one is true .
marketing executive : i forgot . one is true , and . seven is fal
user interface designer : and a four is neutral .
marketing executive : four is neutral , .
industrial designer : so maybe a two .
user interface designer : we have not got the double curve , so we ca not like say it is completely true .
project manager : go for one .
user interface designer : but it is pretty close . we have got almost everything we can .
marketing executive : . i gonna put underneath so i have got some more space . so , false is seven , true is one , and so say about a two for fancy , you think ?
project manager : why not , m maybe nearer three .
marketing executive : d you do an average at the end , i .
project manager : two three . , it is just that saying something remember that when you look down , we have got solar power , we have got various other things you could have , and we are not going for these options .
marketing executive : this this is just for like the look . does it look fancy rather than functional . so
user interface designer : i suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit .
marketing executive : so that so sh should we go for a two on that ? and , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ?
industrial designer : deciding between the kinetic power or the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition .
marketing executive : d . so , what about the pr the prototype as it is , we have got the speech recognition on it , have not we .
industrial designer : but not the kinetic .
marketing executive : but not the kinetic .
industrial designer : like the power .
project manager : no . you ca not afford that w we took that out too .
industrial designer : no , we c ca we ca not afford both .
marketing executive : alright , so
project manager : did not you ? or
marketing executive : so it does not it is pretty the prototype as it is is not fulfilling the
industrial designer : no may is maybe about neutral
user interface designer : maybe a three .
industrial designer : plus it is got something , but it has not got
project manager : a minute . in thirteen point seven we do have kinetic .
user interface designer : i would give it more than a four .
project manager : the problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five .
industrial designer : right .
project manager : and one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . so , it is very much dependant on what you do with your options . and if you are definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that
marketing executive : right , .
project manager : the other functions we have got in are more at the the special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that is at the high end that is point six , whereas down at just special colours is point two . now you are trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you are going for the sample sensors speaker , you are then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . and and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your sample sensor speaker , and then you are looking to take out point two ,
marketing executive : s i am just gonna check my email .
project manager : which would be come from the button supplements category .
marketing executive : i am just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for the product .
user interface designer : how much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? because we did say that we do not wanna follow the fashion too much . if the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough .
project manager : interface type ,
user interface designer : and then it stand the test of time better .
project manager : plastic rather than rubber .
marketing executive : . but i
project manager : that that would make the significant difference . you could either you could have it if you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you would be looking to take out point two . so you could fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . and that would enable you to do it .
industrial designer : so it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so
project manager : ye
marketing executive : read the email again and it says it is evaluate the design as it is , so we need to think about finance after we have evaluated that design . i whether we are doing it in the wrong order or .
project manager : but
user interface designer : i suppose it is rubber as it is , is not it .
project manager : it is rubber as it is , yes .
marketing executive : so , does this need to go up a bit , we have got both the speech
project manager : we got we have got thirteen point seven and we have got it in at the moment and if and , we are going to reduce down from that . but the current one , you would say would be fancy , would be too
marketing executive : . , for innovation , so we have got the speech thing , and
project manager : i would have said about a two as .
marketing executive : do you reckon a two ?
user interface designer : two or three . i would be happy with a two .
marketing executive : . and the next one is i will have to get it back up now .
project manager : the next on , just sing about . i would have said yes . i would go for a one on that at this point in time .
user interface designer : i would say so as .
project manager : incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . , it certainly has some .
user interface designer : it is got the cherry and the sponginess .
industrial designer : it does , .
marketing executive : say about a three maybe ?
project manager : i .
industrial designer : m
user interface designer : maybe two ?
industrial designer : it was just doing it quite . , we are gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it is
project manager : i woulda said two would seem reasonable .
marketing executive : it is a two .
project manager : the product is a recognisable real r reaction product ?
marketing executive : this is
industrial designer : the sensor using all of its products , all of its buttons ,
marketing executive : this
industrial designer : and it is got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from .
user interface designer : that is a bit rough at the minute .
marketing executive : so this is about the corporate image of like new sleek technology and all that thing , as having the logo on and all that . so is it a recognisable product . does it fit in with our other products , which are coffee makers and spacecraft .
project manager : s
user interface designer : it is got the same speech feature as the coffee machine .
marketing executive : what do y
industrial designer : also it is spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age . , it depends which way you look at it .
project manager : so we are going for a two ,
industrial designer : maybe a three ? d
project manager : three ?
user interface designer : two or three .
marketing executive : two or three ?
user interface designer : the logo would be more recognisable on the actual thing . it is just that the pen would not really write on that paper . but , the logo would definitely be recognisable . and it does have attributes that other products do .
marketing executive : two or three .
project manager : two .
marketing executive : how
project manager : right , come on . that is that decided .
marketing executive : two .
project manager : right . so we are now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then
user interface designer : what does what do all them numbers mean then ? do we add them up and rate or anything ?
marketing executive : we s , we add them up so at an average is gonna be i am just gonna do this in my head .
project manager : about a two .
marketing executive : one point eight is not it . so , pretty close to a two .
industrial designer : so it is
marketing executive : so it is pretty good at the moment , but it is gonna get worse , is not it . but we have got ta try and make it does not get too bad .
project manager : two b two , .
industrial designer : so should we get so are definite was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has .
project manager : yes .
industrial designer : so we need to
project manager : you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements .
marketing executive : do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the finances
project manager : i put it back on .
industrial designer : so i this is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ?
marketing executive : i am not .
user interface designer : we will probably have to re - rate it .
project manager : yes , i would have thought so .
industrial designer : we will make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going .
project manager : so what was it , control f _ eight , was not it ?
user interface designer : it is on .
marketing executive : it is come on already .
project manager : . so , you can see there that the if you want to keep kinetic , right , you have got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . you have got the sample sensor and sample speaker , which is your big item .
industrial designer : actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , which gets us in right within the budget range .
project manager : which gets you
user interface designer : that would be fine . because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway .
industrial designer : so that is eleven point seven , and then we could make we definitely had all the button supplements .
project manager : alright .
marketing executive : different different colours , . , i was thinking that because maybe the rubber case is a bit less in the corporate identity than the sleeker plastic case .
industrial designer : possibly , .
project manager : so
industrial designer : and that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . so we would lose a little bit on the maybe
project manager : so we are going for plastic , yes ?
marketing executive : lose a little bit on the fashion , but
industrial designer : and that would now be
marketing executive : and then
industrial designer : that is within the budget . do we actually have do we just have one special forms down here ?
project manager : w there was debate as to how you would count them . you got special colour . originally i was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour .
industrial designer : and we have got enough for another
user interface designer : we should just imagine white buttons .
industrial designer : we have got nought point eight left , so we have got enough for another
project manager : we have got special form . now that would be one button , and the question was that all buttons or is that just one button . our plan really was to have one button only with a special so so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same .
industrial designer : but the but the
project manager : the other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium .
industrial designer : maybe the special colour , we have got three now just because the volume buttons are different , i we would have the ones which are blue at the moment would just be the standard colour .
project manager : so , special colour , you want three in there .
industrial designer : which we should they will still be fine for the price .
marketing executive : i thin you just need two for the special colour it is just two supplements , . one original colour and then two supplements , maybe .
project manager : that makes sense .
industrial designer : that is probably it .
marketing executive : so we only ne we only need two for that . these are moulded . the one colour is gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas of rubber , is not it .
project manager : . , i would agree with that , . and we have got special form is the one apple . the rest are all standard , although you could argue that should maybe be you were making these buttons down the bottom , i was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? was that the idea ?
industrial designer : ne
user interface designer : the volume ones should stand out a bit .
industrial designer : maybe that will be a second supplement . then there is a spe a second special form .
marketing executive : that
project manager : i would have thought that is probably about r .
industrial designer : you got twelve .
marketing executive : so tha
industrial designer : so that should still be . , that is twelve point three , so we are still within budget on that .
project manager : that makes sense .
industrial designer : so decide we have lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , but generally speaking , we have kept the other attributes to the
project manager : i woulda said so . so you would maybe put fash fan fashion at three rather than two .
industrial designer : that is without
marketing executive : so shall we do a ,
industrial designer : and specially it definitely could fits the real product what was the what is the company name ?
project manager : real reaction produ
user interface designer : real reactions ?
industrial designer : r .
project manager : i am not quite , what does that mean ?
industrial designer : it still seems definitely fit that p so that is like if that is the new age inno innovative c type company , then having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on
marketing executive : so
project manager : i would s
marketing executive : so it is w if we have put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be a different shape . like we got a cherry one . maybe other ones could be something else shaped . that would be poss seeing as it is cheaper to make them a different seeing as we have got , we have made it a special form , so
project manager : you mean of
marketing executive : and that would maybe keep us close on the fashion type one . and it would , keep it quite fancy as ,
project manager : you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , because at the moment you are making a red apple . so next year you could make next year is model the same , but have it as a whate whatever , a lemon .
industrial designer : so it is a
marketing executive : you could
industrial designer : whatever fruit was in fashion next year .
project manager : l a lemon .
marketing executive : the volume buttons could be lemons , maybe .
project manager : and that amount
marketing executive : so , we have what have we rid of . we got rid of the plastic .
project manager : we have the main thing we have changed really is the casing is not it ?
marketing executive : is it
industrial designer : that , that was
marketing executive : the rubber .
industrial designer : that was just about all . we have saved quite a bit because we have just got the push - button interface , which is by far the cheapest . so maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we have lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side ?
marketing executive : but
industrial designer : and that is like the most standard type of button .
marketing executive : so , we have got we got rid of the rubber case , but we have now s we now got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . so maybe in terms of fanciness and fashionability , we are the same , maybe . so , we could maybe put two again on them .
industrial designer : and everything else has stayed the same , so
project manager : ease has certainly stayed .
industrial designer : plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to use .
marketing executive : and what about the innovation ?
industrial designer : we have still got the kinetic energy .
marketing executive : do you think
project manager : and the speech feature .
industrial designer : the speech feature .
marketing executive : and then , the corporate identity .
industrial designer : we have cut just about the same . we have maybe lost has not it it is hard to tell how the rubber casing would really affect
project manager : how it would play out , .
marketing executive : whether whether that is considered to be part of the corporate identity , i . , it is maybe not .
industrial designer : but more the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the actual aesthetics , but but either way , we have made it fairly close to what
marketing executive : . ,
user interface designer : i do not see how we could make it any more . , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing .
marketing executive : we cou
user interface designer : but then what colour would you make the r_s ?
industrial designer : just the company logo . so maybe there is like a set design which we get printed off .
project manager : but you have got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick - on badge . so you are in a sense , you are comparing the product without the company logo . and then y but you have got the space for it to stick it on .
marketing executive : hey , what what is the company colour ? did you get told what the company colour is or
industrial designer : i am still not quite we have established that .
user interface designer : no ,
project manager : do not . but but i but in the sense that , as you saw with the windows logo badge , it does not really matter .
user interface designer : we got the logo off the web browser .
marketing executive : right .
project manager : there is virtually n the way that you frame , the windows badge on there , it really does not matter what colour it is , so long as our company is logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . fact , they have got black and white or black and silver . so , even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you have got effectively a double edging on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the product . and that is actually quite a sneaky way of doing it .
marketing executive : you have got we have got point two to play with if you really wanted to .
project manager : you could put in another
marketing executive : another colour .
project manager : in this one , you have actually got three colours of buttons .
marketing executive : or would that be t
project manager : we decided that the blue ones were the standard colour . so you were talking about we are assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . which m may or may not be the case .
marketing executive : shall we save the point two for profitability then ?
project manager : . bu but was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the other opt , on the second page , as it were , that you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ?
user interface designer : i do not think they would really need to be . if they were just all small round blue buttons , it would be fine .
industrial designer : maybe we have m
user interface designer : needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as .
industrial designer : maybe for the one they are gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and , fit the idea of what they want . and then for the more functional buttons , we do not worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it is hidden away anyway , you are not gonna see it at the start .
marketing executive : it is the thing that , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . so , if it is dead obvious , then that is fine . but if you are opening the panel and you are looking and you are tuning , then you are paying a bit more attention . so it may be different colour buttons is not so important .
project manager : alright .
marketing executive : you
project manager : so we just add that to profitability in effect .
marketing executive : so we have dropped the cost , but
project manager : right , so we are meant to finish up in five minutes .
marketing executive : same function ? it is alright . just made a load of money .
user interface designer : should not we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? we have lost the overall spongy feel . it does not seem right that it just has not changed .
marketing executive : but we said that w because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra fruit shape on one of the buttons .
user interface designer : alright .
marketing executive : le lemon sh
user interface designer : did we decide what that was , which button it was ? on the volume ones ?
marketing executive : we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones .
user interface designer : right .
industrial designer : that is good .
marketing executive : like that .
industrial designer : definitely lemon shaped .
marketing executive : did did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? or was it the other way around ?
industrial designer : you had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case . so we can we are .
project manager : so we are this way around .
marketing executive : so that
project manager : until the design team comes in and says , get off .
marketing executive : so we have saved
project manager : but you are the design team .
industrial designer : then we say it is fine , so it is all good .
marketing executive : saved two euros on that .
project manager : so what bit are we on to ?
user interface designer : can check if that is a cherry or an apple ? did we decide against the apple because of apple mac ? and did we make it a cherry officially ?
project manager : i th .
industrial designer : just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like .
project manager : drats , i have botched that , have not i .
user interface designer : so were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ?
marketing executive : we are aiming for one for all of them . m but it really has to fit into the budget , so i we just have to adjust things to get it i in the which is fair enough .
industrial designer : and we seem to have least something in each criteria . we have not completely left anything out , so as an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we have just about achieved everything .
marketing executive : most
user interface designer : so do we have anything else to discuss ?
marketing executive : what is on the agenda ?
project manager : right , what is happened here ? right , right . so we got so we have done the finance bit and the excel project and the we have done the redesign .
industrial designer : we have got the closing .
project manager : so we are now on to project process . now satisfaction with , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . so , we are actually now , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it . so what did you and remembering that nobody is just over the curtain . so ,
marketing executive : finish your meeting now .
industrial designer : we should just go through this quickly and then
project manager : i suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which i will do . so , i have to finish that page . right , so project evaluation . did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves enough ?
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : some of the divisions though between the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary .
project manager : individual meetings . how do you mean ?
marketing executive : we were finding out various things in be in - between the meetings ,
project manager : in you on your own .
marketing executive : and they did not the one meeting did not always follow on for the other one , we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you would looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you would also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , and i do not understand why it would be in separate meetings that you would do that . , you would probably present it at one like that .
project manager : the only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that . then you go away . you find out information . you then come back . you then discuss it . you then go and change things around , and then go back .
industrial designer : i suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time
project manager : whereas , this time , you are really getting it from a database source ,
industrial designer : and then diff things will be relevant .
project manager : so it is not anyway , so , what do you want to put down ? i have put , seemed . creativity , seemed . flow of information on any given subject sometimes disjointed .
user interface designer : it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . a remote control is not the most fancy thing that you could imagine designing .
marketing executive : the thing itself .
user interface designer : i ca not think of a better example at the minute .
project manager : have could have used a different example pel to increase create creativity .
industrial designer : is this go it kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on .
project manager : you have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so
marketing executive : but think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . it depends what business you are in , i . this one seems . from the website it looks it is quite innovative , but we are coming up with some bucket shop product are not we that is , fifteen quid .
industrial designer : one of those things . like , companies can have like a range of products and
project manager : i th i d
industrial designer : i how it works but i that something got sent out and have like a brief to
project manager : but the other thing is that they are i am guessing that they are trying to use this software to demonstrate how you could do a project . , m my wife at the moment , is acting as a computer for you normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed . so what she is doing is she is having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can ask whatever question . and then you or the idea is that the whichever person is at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or come back , or go and see joe bloggs , or whatever . so , and that was a project i suspect similar to this , because they were actually trying to debug the computer software to enable it to work . and , you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong . so
industrial designer : sh we look at the last slide , see if it is got anything else .
project manager : alright ,
industrial designer : there is one more to go .
project manager : so we have got
marketing executive : if you look at their products on their website here , real reaction , it is all pretty high - tech and cutting edge .
project manager : new ideas found ,
marketing executive : and
project manager : did we find any , no .
industrial designer : it was quite good with this the white board , having that and the digital pens . like , that is something that made it a little easier .
project manager : leadership , teamwork .
marketing executive : we did find a new idea , a kinetic remote control . i have never seen one of them before . so
project manager : does
industrial designer : voice recognition , especially not could
project manager : you have got voice recognition computers , that is not remote controls .
user interface designer : it is a different application of it .
industrial designer : so it is just like the same products , but just put together in a different way .
project manager : so how do you reckon teamwork went ?
marketing executive : that went , .
industrial designer : i we all had separate ideas and then discussed them .
marketing executive :  , .
project manager : to go reasonably .
marketing executive : i do not think the budget allowed us to do anything
project manager : bit bit arbitrary .
marketing executive : i do not think it fitted in with the rest of their products . , they have got all these , high definition d_v_d _ and portable seven inch d lightweight computer screens , and i am thinking , do , one cheap remote control does not really fit in .
project manager : so , we are m we are meant to comment on leadership and the means , e _ g _ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera .
marketing executive : surely they should produ
project manager : and and new i new ideas found was the other thing .
user interface designer : leadership is a bit of a funny one , is not it . but we ca not really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the project manager . you were the leader . so our experience of leadership was not really as much as yours .
project manager : now , i would much rather be in marketing but i certainly did not get this computer to work as i would have liked . however , alright means , so whiteboard so really , it is equipment .
marketing executive : it worked .
user interface designer : very .
marketing executive : comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but
user interface designer : but , i d i do not i am not i see the value in these . , they record what you are writing , and then what do you do with it ? where do you get the recording ? do you plug the computer ?
marketing executive : there is a little chi
industrial designer : so it is not just for us , it is for the experiment as a whole , so
marketing executive : there is a little there is a little chip , you must plug it into something
industrial designer : should we quickly look at the last slide ?
marketing executive : and it produces a
industrial designer : sh
user interface designer : you watch a video of it .
marketing executive : whether it just produces a big image of everything you have written , and page after page .
project manager : new ideas found , so one or two .
marketing executive : kinetic powered remote control . , what was the other one ?
user interface designer : voice recognition thing .
marketing executive : vo .
project manager : and voice , was it voice activated
marketing executive : voice recognition , . s
project manager : recognition .
marketing executive : almost . to fill in these questionnaires
project manager : right , so , are the costs within budget ,
marketing executive : no .
project manager : yes . is the project evaluated , do not forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . then celebration .
industrial designer : . is that everything ?
marketing executive : ? that we have got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting .
project manager : so we do not re so really i tried to save this the last time at twelve point three , and it did not seem to have saved anywhere .","the first prototype for the remote control was made of single-curved rubber with a total of 16 rubber buttons (some of them in a slide-out panel) with a cherry design on top . it uses kinetic energy and has a sample sensor for the speech recognition . the initial cost was calculated at 13.70 euros . although over budget , the team decided to evaluate this prototype before making any changes . on a scale from 1 (true) to 7 (false) they rated it on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (2) , technological innovation (2) , ease of use (1) , incorporation of fashion elements (2) , and brand recognition (2). changing the rubber case to plastic reduced the cost and allowed for an extra button-form and colour . the team were reasonably satisfied with the project in terms of teamwork and creativity , although they thought that the flow of information was sometimes disjointed . however , the idea of designing a remote control seemed unexciting , especially since the requirements restricted it to tv only , and the budget was too small . finally , some new ideas were also found in the form of kinetic energy source and use of speech recognition . the team have two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting to complete before they finish . the remote will be single-curved with a cherry design on top . the case will be made of plastic . the buttons will be made of rubber mostly in a light blue colour . however , volume and channel buttons will be different from the rest . volume buttons will be lemon-shaped and coloured . a slide-out panel with extra buttons for less-used functions is included . the buttons in this panel will all be in the standard blue colour . a simple chip is going to support the electronics of the device . a sample sensor was included to add speech recognition . the remote is going to be powered by kinetic energy . after changing the case material from rubber to plastic , it was debated that the loss of sponginess does affect the fancy appeal and trendiness of the remote . on the other hand , it was argued that the special colours and form compensated for that . the team were not certain to what extent the prototype satisfied recognisability of the corporate identity . they were not certain what the colour of the company logo should be and how the logo should be displayed .
","the user interface designer and the industrial designer presented their prototype to the group . it featured an apple-like design with a cherry-like logo . the prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). the project manager discussed the final cost with the group; after an analysis of all of the components , the final cost was lower than initially projected . the group then evaluated the prototype on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). the group decided that the prototype met enough of the initial project criteria to be able to market the product . the project manager led an evaluation of the project process . the group felt that they worked well together and that they had room to be creative . they complained that they had difficulties using the meeting-room equipment , and the project manager advised them to delete all of their personal documents from the meeting-room computer and to use the internet instead . the project manager instructed the marketing expert to report on the project process; the marketing executive found the meeting-room equipment to be satisfactory and the group had room to be creative . the group decided that the prototype met enough of the initial project criteria to be able to market the product . the group had problems with some of the meeting-room equipment . the group complained that they had difficulties using the meeting-room computer and had to delete all of their personal documents from the meeting-room computer . the project manager instructed the marketing expert to report on the project process . the group had problems with some of the meeting-",x,,x,,,x,,,3.0,Pegasus-Baseline
107,"project manager : so is why not save that .
marketing executive : no , you will ha have to open it up from elsewhere .
project manager : do you want to replace existing file , no . i actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but
marketing executive : you have to close that window . that is the save one is not it , so and then find it .
project manager : spreadsheet . , but i have ta right , i will just re - do it . that is the easiest way .
user interface designer : we have made our prototype anyway . we can have a good look at that .
marketing executive : you pass it round to have a look .
user interface designer :  . y no , it is a slightly curved around the sides .
marketing executive : very .
user interface designer : it is almost curved like up to the main display as . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . and we have got the stick on the button with the company logo on .
industrial designer : we also have a apple slash cherry design at the top .
marketing executive : so it is , . cherry would be alright actually .
user interface designer : it is a bit more fun , is not it ? and it is kinda not really at a you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac .
industrial designer : we might get a
marketing executive : copyright , . what is this one ?
user interface designer : and cherries are fun , summery .
marketing executive : what is that one there ?
user interface designer : that is the mute .
industrial designer : for the m _ .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : it it would probably have to be labelled mute .
industrial designer : they are thinking
user interface designer : but , we did not have anything small enough to write .
industrial designer : for the first time , it was hard to get the h the actual labelling on the individual buttons .
user interface designer : we just chose simple shapes for all them . , the important ones are the volume ones . so we made them a bit bigger . the mute could possibly be a bit smaller .
industrial designer : you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you have got the volume in orange on design there , and the channel is in blue .
project manager : r right . ,
user interface designer : and we chose a v _ plus and v _ minus .
project manager : all these things have cost implications . and so when i done my thing on cost a i had assumed that the only button that would be a different colour would be the red apple button . so however , i have now . but , so but there would be a cost implication on that ,
marketing executive : i will see if find them .
project manager : and as i suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be open to debate , i suppose .
industrial designer : sis
user interface designer : the colours would not like that is they would not be too important ,
marketing executive : have
user interface designer : but we did not have any white play - doh . so that is where the colour buttons came from .
project manager : an important consideration . right , so and the second one underneath would be the idea for the
industrial designer : yes , we will have the slide - away .
project manager : right , . so we have got detail design meeting .
industrial designer : bottom .
project manager : so , we have got prototype presentation , which we have just done , evaluation criteria , and finance , so i w we have to evaluate if that meets the various aspects that we are looking for from our previous meeting . so other than the fact that it does not have the second layer , but it would .
industrial designer :  .
project manager : but other than that , we got the red apple . we got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the colouration of the buttons ,
industrial designer : yes , yes .
project manager : and the bit after the evaluation criteria is the finance . and the and the cost implication .
marketing executive : right .
project manager : the only snag about this is that the cost is probably important . so , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to manufacture . , and whether it would
marketing executive : so if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ?
industrial designer : this this is a
user interface designer : that is it .
industrial designer : yes , this is our presentation of the prototype .
marketing executive : that is the pr
project manager : right , so as far as the finance of it would be concern would be to make that the cost aye the production cost you may remember that was one of the first considerations was to be in d under twelve fifty or two and a half twelve and a half euros . so , there is no redesign . so that should right , so , seems to me that the thing that i have to do is quickly find that
industrial designer : could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there ?
marketing executive : we should plug it in . do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the back of that one .
industrial designer : alice . so , sh
marketing executive : we could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype .
project manager : right .
industrial designer : this should be then .
project manager : so , by the fact that we have got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source , we have got a single curved case . we have got a rubber case materials supplements . so , we had decided that we are having rubber buttons and
industrial designer : have a push button interface .
project manager : . w the button supplements . , originally , there would just be one in there because it was the one red apple . but so the so the real w the real question then would come in . do you make all the buttons
marketing executive : do we will do it on the prototype ,
project manager : o
marketing executive : so do two , see how much it is .
project manager : so we have got one special button form , which was the apple . everything else is gonna be a standard . we have got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that ,
industrial designer : and then we would have
project manager : so , i was originally , i was thinking rubber was not special , but according to this , maybe it is . and the r effectively we have got sixteen buttons that we are gonna have on there .
marketing executive : you just do one , do not you , for the
project manager : w i is the answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore , what is the op the option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore
marketing executive : it is just a one . else
project manager : whereas it would be the special colour would be for the so you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic .
marketing executive : i thi the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material , rather than per button .
project manager : i would every design change is sound ] , , if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , i . we would have one special colour and one special button form . and when i plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half . as far as i know , that took care of the various supplements . and if what happened ?
marketing executive : you have just gone off the window into another one . it is on the bottom row .
user interface designer : maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right - hand corner of the little box .
project manager : now , right . , so , but the point would be that if we just did special you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : so that is nine point one there so we have got some
project manager : so it , is it s is no , it is nine point seven i have got .
industrial designer : just give us a bit of
project manager : so , that would work out fine if as assuming your correction are assuming that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . and there is nothing else as far as see that we had planned to put on .
user interface designer : s
industrial designer : i switching around those th on the electronics we got the sample sensor . at the moment we have just got the simple chip , which costs one . , i the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? we should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech
project manager : hold on . , if we , that gives us twelve point seven
industrial designer : so maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition
project manager : but remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the
industrial designer : without
project manager : i see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : . d would not you have to keep the simple chip there as ? how you turn that one to a zero , would not the chip and the sample speaker be separate things ,
marketing executive : we have to have it
industrial designer : possibly , maybe .
user interface designer : so you need both of them ?
industrial designer : maybe we would be giving up on the kinetic .
project manager : and go for battery instead . that would give you one less .
industrial designer : we should , that would save us one , though we would still be slightly ov
project manager : but you reckon that i that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries .
industrial designer : since it is the through the whole technology type thing , you were saying in the market research that people like interesting gadgets in them . , whether they would figure the s sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be a worthwhile thing to have . and then still have the batteries , or whatever they would prefer not what ? the the problem was the battery is running out and losing the remote .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : so you got ta decide which of those is more important to them .
project manager : but which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ? in a sense , at the moment , we have got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two .
user interface designer : the voice recognition .
project manager : at least . remember that was a minimum requirement . the other option if we are planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to make it originally , we are gonna make it a simple product .
marketing executive : shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we have got it now first , and then make decisions about what needs to be changed after ?
project manager :  .
marketing executive : . right , i have a little thing . so , we have all got a note of it is thirteen point seven , is not it , with everything we want on .
project manager : do you want that back up ?
marketing executive : had a presentation to do .
user interface designer : but i do think the v voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it is got no battery .
project manager : but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost .
marketing executive :  . right , this is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the prototype we have got here . and so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we have formulated . and those ones are gonna be in response to market research , and also finance , i . and do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it is neither true nor false , then that is four . so , i got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as , at the end . so , we have to say whether it is true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . the whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . whether it is easy to use . whether it is incorporating the fashion element to attract the buyer . and whether it is a recognisable real reaction product . and i have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this , so i will go over here . so the first one is , does the product look and feel fancy . so if we do a one so
industrial designer : we have a single curve , which was maybe like the feel of the product is quite good . so , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . , that would be considered fancy .
user interface designer : i would maybe give it a two .
marketing executive : of but what is one false , or is t one true ?
user interface designer : one is true .
marketing executive : i forgot . one is true , and . seven is fal
user interface designer : and a four is neutral .
marketing executive : four is neutral , .
industrial designer : so maybe a two .
user interface designer : we have not got the double curve , so we ca not like say it is completely true .
project manager : go for one .
user interface designer : but it is pretty close . we have got almost everything we can .
marketing executive : . i gonna put underneath so i have got some more space . so , false is seven , true is one , and so say about a two for fancy , you think ?
project manager : why not , m maybe nearer three .
marketing executive : d you do an average at the end , i .
project manager : two three . , it is just that saying something remember that when you look down , we have got solar power , we have got various other things you could have , and we are not going for these options .
marketing executive : this this is just for like the look . does it look fancy rather than functional . so
user interface designer : i suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit .
marketing executive : so that so sh should we go for a two on that ? and , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ?
industrial designer : deciding between the kinetic power or the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition .
marketing executive : d . so , what about the pr the prototype as it is , we have got the speech recognition on it , have not we .
industrial designer : but not the kinetic .
marketing executive : but not the kinetic .
industrial designer : like the power .
project manager : no . you ca not afford that w we took that out too .
industrial designer : no , we c ca we ca not afford both .
marketing executive : alright , so
project manager : did not you ? or
marketing executive : so it does not it is pretty the prototype as it is is not fulfilling the
industrial designer : no may is maybe about neutral
user interface designer : maybe a three .
industrial designer : plus it is got something , but it has not got
project manager : a minute . in thirteen point seven we do have kinetic .
user interface designer : i would give it more than a four .
project manager : the problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five .
industrial designer : right .
project manager : and one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . so , it is very much dependant on what you do with your options . and if you are definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that
marketing executive : right , .
project manager : the other functions we have got in are more at the the special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that is at the high end that is point six , whereas down at just special colours is point two . now you are trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you are going for the sample sensors speaker , you are then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . and and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your sample sensor speaker , and then you are looking to take out point two ,
marketing executive : s i am just gonna check my email .
project manager : which would be come from the button supplements category .
marketing executive : i am just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for the product .
user interface designer : how much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? because we did say that we do not wanna follow the fashion too much . if the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough .
project manager : interface type ,
user interface designer : and then it stand the test of time better .
project manager : plastic rather than rubber .
marketing executive : . but i
project manager : that that would make the significant difference . you could either you could have it if you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you would be looking to take out point two . so you could fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . and that would enable you to do it .
industrial designer : so it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so
project manager : ye
marketing executive : read the email again and it says it is evaluate the design as it is , so we need to think about finance after we have evaluated that design . i whether we are doing it in the wrong order or .
project manager : but
user interface designer : i suppose it is rubber as it is , is not it .
project manager : it is rubber as it is , yes .
marketing executive : so , does this need to go up a bit , we have got both the speech
project manager : we got we have got thirteen point seven and we have got it in at the moment and if and , we are going to reduce down from that . but the current one , you would say would be fancy , would be too
marketing executive : . , for innovation , so we have got the speech thing , and
project manager : i would have said about a two as .
marketing executive : do you reckon a two ?
user interface designer : two or three . i would be happy with a two .
marketing executive : . and the next one is i will have to get it back up now .
project manager : the next on , just sing about . i would have said yes . i would go for a one on that at this point in time .
user interface designer : i would say so as .
project manager : incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . , it certainly has some .
user interface designer : it is got the cherry and the sponginess .
industrial designer : it does , .
marketing executive : say about a three maybe ?
project manager : i .
industrial designer : m
user interface designer : maybe two ?
industrial designer : it was just doing it quite . , we are gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it is
project manager : i woulda said two would seem reasonable .
marketing executive : it is a two .
project manager : the product is a recognisable real r reaction product ?
marketing executive : this is
industrial designer : the sensor using all of its products , all of its buttons ,
marketing executive : this
industrial designer : and it is got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from .
user interface designer : that is a bit rough at the minute .
marketing executive : so this is about the corporate image of like new sleek technology and all that thing , as having the logo on and all that . so is it a recognisable product . does it fit in with our other products , which are coffee makers and spacecraft .
project manager : s
user interface designer : it is got the same speech feature as the coffee machine .
marketing executive : what do y
industrial designer : also it is spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age . , it depends which way you look at it .
project manager : so we are going for a two ,
industrial designer : maybe a three ? d
project manager : three ?
user interface designer : two or three .
marketing executive : two or three ?
user interface designer : the logo would be more recognisable on the actual thing . it is just that the pen would not really write on that paper . but , the logo would definitely be recognisable . and it does have attributes that other products do .
marketing executive : two or three .
project manager : two .
marketing executive : how
project manager : right , come on . that is that decided .
marketing executive : two .
project manager : right . so we are now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then
user interface designer : what does what do all them numbers mean then ? do we add them up and rate or anything ?
marketing executive : we s , we add them up so at an average is gonna be i am just gonna do this in my head .
project manager : about a two .
marketing executive : one point eight is not it . so , pretty close to a two .
industrial designer : so it is
marketing executive : so it is pretty good at the moment , but it is gonna get worse , is not it . but we have got ta try and make it does not get too bad .
project manager : two b two , .
industrial designer : so should we get so are definite was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has .
project manager : yes .
industrial designer : so we need to
project manager : you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements .
marketing executive : do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the finances
project manager : i put it back on .
industrial designer : so i this is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ?
marketing executive : i am not .
user interface designer : we will probably have to re - rate it .
project manager : yes , i would have thought so .
industrial designer : we will make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going .
project manager : so what was it , control f _ eight , was not it ?
user interface designer : it is on .
marketing executive : it is come on already .
project manager : . so , you can see there that the if you want to keep kinetic , right , you have got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . you have got the sample sensor and sample speaker , which is your big item .
industrial designer : actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , which gets us in right within the budget range .
project manager : which gets you
user interface designer : that would be fine . because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway .
industrial designer : so that is eleven point seven , and then we could make we definitely had all the button supplements .
project manager : alright .
marketing executive : different different colours , . , i was thinking that because maybe the rubber case is a bit less in the corporate identity than the sleeker plastic case .
industrial designer : possibly , .
project manager : so
industrial designer : and that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . so we would lose a little bit on the maybe
project manager : so we are going for plastic , yes ?
marketing executive : lose a little bit on the fashion , but
industrial designer : and that would now be
marketing executive : and then
industrial designer : that is within the budget . do we actually have do we just have one special forms down here ?
project manager : w there was debate as to how you would count them . you got special colour . originally i was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour .
industrial designer : and we have got enough for another
user interface designer : we should just imagine white buttons .
industrial designer : we have got nought point eight left , so we have got enough for another
project manager : we have got special form . now that would be one button , and the question was that all buttons or is that just one button . our plan really was to have one button only with a special so so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same .
industrial designer : but the but the
project manager : the other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium .
industrial designer : maybe the special colour , we have got three now just because the volume buttons are different , i we would have the ones which are blue at the moment would just be the standard colour .
project manager : so , special colour , you want three in there .
industrial designer : which we should they will still be fine for the price .
marketing executive : i thin you just need two for the special colour it is just two supplements , . one original colour and then two supplements , maybe .
project manager : that makes sense .
industrial designer : that is probably it .
marketing executive : so we only ne we only need two for that . these are moulded . the one colour is gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas of rubber , is not it .
project manager : . , i would agree with that , . and we have got special form is the one apple . the rest are all standard , although you could argue that should maybe be you were making these buttons down the bottom , i was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? was that the idea ?
industrial designer : ne
user interface designer : the volume ones should stand out a bit .
industrial designer : maybe that will be a second supplement . then there is a spe a second special form .
marketing executive : that
project manager : i would have thought that is probably about r .
industrial designer : you got twelve .
marketing executive : so tha
industrial designer : so that should still be . , that is twelve point three , so we are still within budget on that .
project manager : that makes sense .
industrial designer : so decide we have lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , but generally speaking , we have kept the other attributes to the
project manager : i woulda said so . so you would maybe put fash fan fashion at three rather than two .
industrial designer : that is without
marketing executive : so shall we do a ,
industrial designer : and specially it definitely could fits the real product what was the what is the company name ?
project manager : real reaction produ
user interface designer : real reactions ?
industrial designer : r .
project manager : i am not quite , what does that mean ?
industrial designer : it still seems definitely fit that p so that is like if that is the new age inno innovative c type company , then having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on
marketing executive : so
project manager : i would s
marketing executive : so it is w if we have put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be a different shape . like we got a cherry one . maybe other ones could be something else shaped . that would be poss seeing as it is cheaper to make them a different seeing as we have got , we have made it a special form , so
project manager : you mean of
marketing executive : and that would maybe keep us close on the fashion type one . and it would , keep it quite fancy as ,
project manager : you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , because at the moment you are making a red apple . so next year you could make next year is model the same , but have it as a whate whatever , a lemon .
industrial designer : so it is a
marketing executive : you could
industrial designer : whatever fruit was in fashion next year .
project manager : l a lemon .
marketing executive : the volume buttons could be lemons , maybe .
project manager : and that amount
marketing executive : so , we have what have we rid of . we got rid of the plastic .
project manager : we have the main thing we have changed really is the casing is not it ?
marketing executive : is it
industrial designer : that , that was
marketing executive : the rubber .
industrial designer : that was just about all . we have saved quite a bit because we have just got the push - button interface , which is by far the cheapest . so maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we have lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side ?
marketing executive : but
industrial designer : and that is like the most standard type of button .
marketing executive : so , we have got we got rid of the rubber case , but we have now s we now got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . so maybe in terms of fanciness and fashionability , we are the same , maybe . so , we could maybe put two again on them .
industrial designer : and everything else has stayed the same , so
project manager : ease has certainly stayed .
industrial designer : plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to use .
marketing executive : and what about the innovation ?
industrial designer : we have still got the kinetic energy .
marketing executive : do you think
project manager : and the speech feature .
industrial designer : the speech feature .
marketing executive : and then , the corporate identity .
industrial designer : we have cut just about the same . we have maybe lost has not it it is hard to tell how the rubber casing would really affect
project manager : how it would play out , .
marketing executive : whether whether that is considered to be part of the corporate identity , i . , it is maybe not .
industrial designer : but more the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the actual aesthetics , but but either way , we have made it fairly close to what
marketing executive : . ,
user interface designer : i do not see how we could make it any more . , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing .
marketing executive : we cou
user interface designer : but then what colour would you make the r_s ?
industrial designer : just the company logo . so maybe there is like a set design which we get printed off .
project manager : but you have got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick - on badge . so you are in a sense , you are comparing the product without the company logo . and then y but you have got the space for it to stick it on .
marketing executive : hey , what what is the company colour ? did you get told what the company colour is or
industrial designer : i am still not quite we have established that .
user interface designer : no ,
project manager : do not . but but i but in the sense that , as you saw with the windows logo badge , it does not really matter .
user interface designer : we got the logo off the web browser .
marketing executive : right .
project manager : there is virtually n the way that you frame , the windows badge on there , it really does not matter what colour it is , so long as our company is logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . fact , they have got black and white or black and silver . so , even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you have got effectively a double edging on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the product . and that is actually quite a sneaky way of doing it .
marketing executive : you have got we have got point two to play with if you really wanted to .
project manager : you could put in another
marketing executive : another colour .
project manager : in this one , you have actually got three colours of buttons .
marketing executive : or would that be t
project manager : we decided that the blue ones were the standard colour . so you were talking about we are assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . which m may or may not be the case .
marketing executive : shall we save the point two for profitability then ?
project manager : . bu but was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the other opt , on the second page , as it were , that you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ?
user interface designer : i do not think they would really need to be . if they were just all small round blue buttons , it would be fine .
industrial designer : maybe we have m
user interface designer : needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as .
industrial designer : maybe for the one they are gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and , fit the idea of what they want . and then for the more functional buttons , we do not worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it is hidden away anyway , you are not gonna see it at the start .
marketing executive : it is the thing that , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . so , if it is dead obvious , then that is fine . but if you are opening the panel and you are looking and you are tuning , then you are paying a bit more attention . so it may be different colour buttons is not so important .
project manager : alright .
marketing executive : you
project manager : so we just add that to profitability in effect .
marketing executive : so we have dropped the cost , but
project manager : right , so we are meant to finish up in five minutes .
marketing executive : same function ? it is alright . just made a load of money .
user interface designer : should not we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? we have lost the overall spongy feel . it does not seem right that it just has not changed .
marketing executive : but we said that w because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra fruit shape on one of the buttons .
user interface designer : alright .
marketing executive : le lemon sh
user interface designer : did we decide what that was , which button it was ? on the volume ones ?
marketing executive : we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones .
user interface designer : right .
industrial designer : that is good .
marketing executive : like that .
industrial designer : definitely lemon shaped .
marketing executive : did did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? or was it the other way around ?
industrial designer : you had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case . so we can we are .
project manager : so we are this way around .
marketing executive : so that
project manager : until the design team comes in and says , get off .
marketing executive : so we have saved
project manager : but you are the design team .
industrial designer : then we say it is fine , so it is all good .
marketing executive : saved two euros on that .
project manager : so what bit are we on to ?
user interface designer : can check if that is a cherry or an apple ? did we decide against the apple because of apple mac ? and did we make it a cherry officially ?
project manager : i th .
industrial designer : just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like .
project manager : drats , i have botched that , have not i .
user interface designer : so were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ?
marketing executive : we are aiming for one for all of them . m but it really has to fit into the budget , so i we just have to adjust things to get it i in the which is fair enough .
industrial designer : and we seem to have least something in each criteria . we have not completely left anything out , so as an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we have just about achieved everything .
marketing executive : most
user interface designer : so do we have anything else to discuss ?
marketing executive : what is on the agenda ?
project manager : right , what is happened here ? right , right . so we got so we have done the finance bit and the excel project and the we have done the redesign .
industrial designer : we have got the closing .
project manager : so we are now on to project process . now satisfaction with , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . so , we are actually now , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it . so what did you and remembering that nobody is just over the curtain . so ,
marketing executive : finish your meeting now .
industrial designer : we should just go through this quickly and then
project manager : i suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which i will do . so , i have to finish that page . right , so project evaluation . did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves enough ?
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : some of the divisions though between the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary .
project manager : individual meetings . how do you mean ?
marketing executive : we were finding out various things in be in - between the meetings ,
project manager : in you on your own .
marketing executive : and they did not the one meeting did not always follow on for the other one , we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you would looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you would also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , and i do not understand why it would be in separate meetings that you would do that . , you would probably present it at one like that .
project manager : the only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that . then you go away . you find out information . you then come back . you then discuss it . you then go and change things around , and then go back .
industrial designer : i suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time
project manager : whereas , this time , you are really getting it from a database source ,
industrial designer : and then diff things will be relevant .
project manager : so it is not anyway , so , what do you want to put down ? i have put , seemed . creativity , seemed . flow of information on any given subject sometimes disjointed .
user interface designer : it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . a remote control is not the most fancy thing that you could imagine designing .
marketing executive : the thing itself .
user interface designer : i ca not think of a better example at the minute .
project manager : have could have used a different example pel to increase create creativity .
industrial designer : is this go it kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on .
project manager : you have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so
marketing executive : but think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . it depends what business you are in , i . this one seems . from the website it looks it is quite innovative , but we are coming up with some bucket shop product are not we that is , fifteen quid .
industrial designer : one of those things . like , companies can have like a range of products and
project manager : i th i d
industrial designer : i how it works but i that something got sent out and have like a brief to
project manager : but the other thing is that they are i am guessing that they are trying to use this software to demonstrate how you could do a project . , m my wife at the moment , is acting as a computer for you normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed . so what she is doing is she is having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can ask whatever question . and then you or the idea is that the whichever person is at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or come back , or go and see joe bloggs , or whatever . so , and that was a project i suspect similar to this , because they were actually trying to debug the computer software to enable it to work . and , you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong . so
industrial designer : sh we look at the last slide , see if it is got anything else .
project manager : alright ,
industrial designer : there is one more to go .
project manager : so we have got
marketing executive : if you look at their products on their website here , real reaction , it is all pretty high - tech and cutting edge .
project manager : new ideas found ,
marketing executive : and
project manager : did we find any , no .
industrial designer : it was quite good with this the white board , having that and the digital pens . like , that is something that made it a little easier .
project manager : leadership , teamwork .
marketing executive : we did find a new idea , a kinetic remote control . i have never seen one of them before . so
project manager : does
industrial designer : voice recognition , especially not could
project manager : you have got voice recognition computers , that is not remote controls .
user interface designer : it is a different application of it .
industrial designer : so it is just like the same products , but just put together in a different way .
project manager : so how do you reckon teamwork went ?
marketing executive : that went , .
industrial designer : i we all had separate ideas and then discussed them .
marketing executive :  , .
project manager : to go reasonably .
marketing executive : i do not think the budget allowed us to do anything
project manager : bit bit arbitrary .
marketing executive : i do not think it fitted in with the rest of their products . , they have got all these , high definition d_v_d _ and portable seven inch d lightweight computer screens , and i am thinking , do , one cheap remote control does not really fit in .
project manager : so , we are m we are meant to comment on leadership and the means , e _ g _ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera .
marketing executive : surely they should produ
project manager : and and new i new ideas found was the other thing .
user interface designer : leadership is a bit of a funny one , is not it . but we ca not really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the project manager . you were the leader . so our experience of leadership was not really as much as yours .
project manager : now , i would much rather be in marketing but i certainly did not get this computer to work as i would have liked . however , alright means , so whiteboard so really , it is equipment .
marketing executive : it worked .
user interface designer : very .
marketing executive : comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but
user interface designer : but , i d i do not i am not i see the value in these . , they record what you are writing , and then what do you do with it ? where do you get the recording ? do you plug the computer ?
marketing executive : there is a little chi
industrial designer : so it is not just for us , it is for the experiment as a whole , so
marketing executive : there is a little there is a little chip , you must plug it into something
industrial designer : should we quickly look at the last slide ?
marketing executive : and it produces a
industrial designer : sh
user interface designer : you watch a video of it .
marketing executive : whether it just produces a big image of everything you have written , and page after page .
project manager : new ideas found , so one or two .
marketing executive : kinetic powered remote control . , what was the other one ?
user interface designer : voice recognition thing .
marketing executive : vo .
project manager : and voice , was it voice activated
marketing executive : voice recognition , . s
project manager : recognition .
marketing executive : almost . to fill in these questionnaires
project manager : right , so , are the costs within budget ,
marketing executive : no .
project manager : yes . is the project evaluated , do not forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . then celebration .
industrial designer : . is that everything ?
marketing executive : ? that we have got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting .
project manager : so we do not re so really i tried to save this the last time at twelve point three , and it did not seem to have saved anywhere .","the first prototype for the remote control was made of single-curved rubber with a total of 16 rubber buttons (some of them in a slide-out panel) with a cherry design on top . it uses kinetic energy and has a sample sensor for the speech recognition . the initial cost was calculated at 13.70 euros . although over budget , the team decided to evaluate this prototype before making any changes . on a scale from 1 (true) to 7 (false) they rated it on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (2) , technological innovation (2) , ease of use (1) , incorporation of fashion elements (2) , and brand recognition (2). changing the rubber case to plastic reduced the cost and allowed for an extra button-form and colour . the team were reasonably satisfied with the project in terms of teamwork and creativity , although they thought that the flow of information was sometimes disjointed . however , the idea of designing a remote control seemed unexciting , especially since the requirements restricted it to tv only , and the budget was too small . finally , some new ideas were also found in the form of kinetic energy source and use of speech recognition . the team have two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting to complete before they finish . the remote will be single-curved with a cherry design on top . the case will be made of plastic . the buttons will be made of rubber mostly in a light blue colour . however , volume and channel buttons will be different from the rest . volume buttons will be lemon-shaped and coloured . a slide-out panel with extra buttons for less-used functions is included . the buttons in this panel will all be in the standard blue colour . a simple chip is going to support the electronics of the device . a sample sensor was included to add speech recognition . the remote is going to be powered by kinetic energy . after changing the case material from rubber to plastic , it was debated that the loss of sponginess does affect the fancy appeal and trendiness of the remote . on the other hand , it was argued that the special colours and form compensated for that . the team were not certain to what extent the prototype satisfied recognisability of the corporate identity . they were not certain what the colour of the company logo should be and how the logo should be displayed .
","the project manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting . the user interface designer and the industrial designer presented the prototype and displayed the changeable fruit and vegetable designs . they also discussed the mute component and the colour options . the marketing expert gave an evaluation of the prototype based on the initial criteria of attractiveness , whether it matches operation behavior of the user , locatability , ergonomic design , and its ability to be misplaced . the group decided that enough of their initial ideas and criteria for the prototype were satisfied to be able to continue with the project . the finance manager analyzed the production cost of the device; the cost was lower than initially projected , at 11.2 euros . it was decided that the device could be used for 12.5 euros instead of the original 12.3 euros . the team then discussed the option to include a second layer of rubber in the design , which was also decided against . the meeting was adjourned without any decisions made about the prototype or the production costs . the next meeting will be to complete the final questionaire and meeting summary . the remote will be made of plastic with rubber changeable covers . the devices will come in different colours: apple , cherry , and zebra . the corporate logo will be on the remote . the buttons will be black/yellow and the company colours will be displayed through the cutouts in the plastic . the device was designed and made with a latex product with a rubbery texture . the prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1",x,,x,,,,,,3.0,BART-Cons

marketing executive : no .
project manager : here is what this thing should be . this thing we are gonna design is a new remote control . should be original , trendy , and , user friendly . so maybe you wanna make some notes of that . here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . that is it is gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we will discuss what we have come up with . the same goes for the conceptual design , there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards . detailed design , same thing .
marketing executive : so three different types of design that we are gonna be concerned with . functional , conception and detailed .
project manager : i ca not write with this thing .
marketing executive : maybe we should redesign it .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : after we have finished the remote control we will get to that .
project manager : . then , tool training try out the white board , participant can draw their favourite animal . does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? so that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board . you wanna go eileen and
marketing executive : i will see what do .
project manager : whether you without hanging yourself .
marketing executive : see if i r see if i remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit .
project manager : and remember you have to press so it works .
marketing executive : so that it will record . traditional kitty cat .
project manager : fat , a fat cat .
marketing executive : i have a very fat cat . and it likes to sit like that .
project manager : and you are francine , right ? would you like s like just to see how it feels , so that you have a little idea ?
user interface designer : yes , i am francina .
project manager : in
marketing executive : am i supposed to wipe off that or
project manager : no , no .
user interface designer : no , .
project manager : i , we will get to that later .
user interface designer : what should i draw ?
industrial designer : snake .
user interface designer : i am going to draw a snake . how does it look like ?
marketing executive : . i hope the kitty cat is hungry i do not like snakes .
project manager : here is the project finance which , we all have to think about when we design this thing . selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro . profit aim for the company is fifty million euro , the market range unlimited meaning international and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty euro .
marketing executive : that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged .
project manager : so these are all things , to remember with the budget and when you design to materials , cost , etcetera . now , the discussion i is does anyone of you have experience with remote control ? i exp i s we use 'em , right , everyday .
industrial designer : using remote control .
user interface designer : yes .
project manager : and now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you did not like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ? would you like it to be smaller , bigger , have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons , things like that ?
user interface designer : i yes , i feel that all the remote should be very compact .
project manager : small , right .
user interface designer : those which we get here nowadays it is very long . and and it should have multi - purpose . like the remote control which we use for t_v _ , it shou it should be used f for some other purpose also , like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air - conditioners , or for heating system .
industrial designer : audio player .
project manager : so it should be a multi - functional gadget that would control all your household machines .
user interface designer : yes , exactly
industrial designer : divides us
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : at twelve fifty euros per who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that . we certainly can try to i agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things .
project manager : it should be something new it should be s it should do something different than just what we have . now , the other thing to think there is maybe the design .
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : design should be , it should be different . all the almost all the remotes
project manager : like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy . maybe it should different colours or materials or .
user interface designer : yes , exactly .
industrial designer : maybe ten i do , colours
user interface designer : are different shapes .
industrial designer : and al shapes also .
project manager : so shapes right , like kidney shape feels better in your hand , .
marketing executive : friendly shape , that would help . another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap , because one of the big things that happens is people lose them . they ca not find it .
project manager : that is true , because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we , whatever . and and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the t_v _ off and they say , where the hell is my remote control ? or if it is really , if it is really in a dark spot that it gives out a sound or a signal .
marketing executive : so some
industrial designer : some beep like that ,
project manager : .
user interface designer : or a b
marketing executive : so , so it is really the beep or , or a light should blink .
industrial designer : so that we can go
project manager : so if lost if lost signal with b throw signal , .
user interface designer : should ha a fluorescent signal , .
industrial designer : maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is .
project manager : exactly , just that is what i am saying .
industrial designer : may not be beep .
project manager : i am just saying throw signal meaning just whether it is a beep or whether a light or
industrial designer : beep or it is a light , maybe it is a light .
marketing executive : and do you think a good c clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ?
project manager : my idea is maybe that the minute it is really hidden , in other words if it is like in a dark spot , meaning like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it is behind a plant , at that moment it is like , what you call it a light s sensors , ? in in that moment it has a sensor , i it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , that we can discuss that later , .
industrial designer : probably it is a
user interface designer : and
marketing executive : so the light sensor would activate the signal .
project manager : there would be
industrial designer :  .
project manager : right you have to have some sensor and voice or clapping it is not specific enough . i know there are the lamps and , you can clap on and off , but they only work to certain degree and
marketing executive : but it could be someplace really obvious and you still would not be able to find it .
project manager : what with
industrial designer : that did not
user interface designer : then , in that case
marketing executive : because you are s because you are silly . because people are silly .
industrial designer : i i we ca not do it .
project manager : but then those people we ca not help everybody .
marketing executive : it could be on , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table ,
project manager : we have
marketing executive : maybe we have to move along , .
project manager : we have to move along , but we have some good points to start with here .
industrial designer : good point .
project manager : the next meeting will be in thirty minutes . you all did you get notices on your computer for this ? so , you got the notice
industrial designer : me .
project manager : . the working design , i that is the function i_d _ who is this ? the industrial designer that is you .
industrial designer : it is functional de , exactly , technical .
project manager : so , we looking for a working design when we come back .
industrial designer : working design , it is mainly technical - functional design .
project manager : then and then the technical funct you are the technical function ,
industrial designer : functional design ,
project manager : so you are the working design .
industrial designer : and you
project manager : so you have a working design and then a functional design . and the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . that would be your idea . that it , that the price is a good price . , the price is given , but , that was
marketing executive : we have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price .
project manager : and , specifi you will get specific instructions for that . that is the end of the show . so we have , we have a twen two three minutes . any questions at this point ? or suggestions ? you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions , i , you can

project manager : small , right .
user interface designer : those which we get here nowadays it is very long . and and it should have multi - purpose . like the remote control which we use for t_v _ , it shou it should be used f for some other purpose also , like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air - conditioners , or for heating system .
industrial designer : audio player .
project manager : so it should be a multi - functional gadget that would control all your household machines .
user interface designer : yes , exactly
industrial designer : divides us
user interface designer : .

project manager : it should be something new it should be s it should do something different than just what we have . now , the other thing to think there is maybe the design .
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : design should be , it should be different . all the almost all the remotes
project manager : like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy . maybe it should different colours or materials or .

user interface designer : are different shapes .
industrial designer : and al shapes also .
project manager : so shapes right , like kidney shape feels better in your hand , .
marketing executive : friendly shape , that would help . another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap , because one of the big things that happens is people lose them . they ca not find it .
project manager : that is true , because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we , whatever . and and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the t_v _ off and they say , where the hell is my remote control ? or if it is really , if it is really in a dark spot that it gives out a sound or a signal .
marketing executive : so some
industrial designer : some beep like that ,
project manager : .
user interface designer : or a b
marketing executive : so , so it is really the beep or , or a light should blink .

industrial designer : beep or it is a light , maybe it is a light .
marketing executive : and do you think a good c clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ?
project manager : my idea is maybe that the minute it is really hidden , in other words if it is like in a dark spot , meaning like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it is behind a plant , at that moment it is like , what you call it a light s sensors , ? in in that moment it has a sensor , i it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , that we can discuss that later , .

user interface designer : and
marketing executive : so the light sensor would activate the signal .

industrial designer :  .

industrial designer : and al shapes also .
project manager : so shapes right , like kidney shape feels better in your hand , .
marketing executive : friendly shape , that would help . another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap , because one of the big things that happens is people lose them . they ca not find it .
project manager : that is true , because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we , whatever . and and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the t_v _ off and they say , where the hell is my remote control ? or if it is really , if it is really in a dark spot that it gives out a sound or a signal .
marketing executive : so some
industrial designer : some beep like that ,
project manager : .
user interface designer : or a b
marketing executive : so , so it is really the beep or , or a light should blink .
industrial designer : so that we can go
project manager : so if lost if lost signal with b throw signal , .
user interface designer : should ha a fluorescent signal , .
industrial designer : maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is .
project manager : exactly , just that is what i am saying .
industrial designer : may not be beep .
project manager : i am just saying throw signal meaning just whether it is a beep or whether a light or
industrial designer : beep or it is a light , maybe it is a light .
marketing executive : and do you think a good c clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ?
project manager : my idea is maybe that the minute it is really hidden , in other words if it is like in a dark spot , meaning like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it is behind a plant , at that moment it is like , what you call it a light s sensors , ? in in that moment it has a sensor , i it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , that we can discuss that later , .
industrial designer : probably it is a
user interface designer : and
marketing executive : so the light sensor would activate the signal .
project manager : there would be
industrial designer :  .
project manager : right you have to have some sensor and voice or clapping it is not specific enough . i know there are the lamps and , you can clap on and off , but they only work to certain degree and
marketing executive : but it could be someplace really obvious and you still would not be able to find it .
project manager : what with
industrial designer : that did not
user interface designer : then , in that case
marketing executive : because you are s because you are silly . because people are silly .
industrial designer : i i we ca not do it .
project manager : but then those people we ca not help everybody .
marketing executive : it could be on , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table ,
project manager : we have
marketing executive : maybe we have to move along , .
project manager : we have to move along , but we have some good points to start with here .
industrial designer : good point .
project manager : the next meeting will be in thirty minutes . you all did you get notices on your computer for this ? so , you got the notice
industrial designer : me .
project manager : . the working design , i that is the function i_d _ who is this ? the industrial designer that is you .
industrial designer : it is functional de , exactly , technical .
project manager : so , we looking for a working design when we come back .
industrial designer : working design , it is mainly technical - functional design .
project manager : then and then the technical funct you are the technical function ,
industrial designer : functional design ,
project manager : so you are the working design .
industrial designer : and you
project manager : so you have a working design and then a functional design . and the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . that would be your idea . that it , that the price is a good price . , the price is given , but , that was
marketing executive : we have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price .
project manager : and , specifi you will get specific instructions for that . that is the end of the show . so we have , we have a twen two three minutes . any questions at this point ? or suggestions ? you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions , i , you can
marketing executive : i have enough to think about ' til our next meeting .
industrial designer : even i have .
marketing executive : how about you people ?
industrial designer : even i have , .
marketing executive : really ?
industrial designer : so let is see .
marketing executive : alright ,
project manager : then we see you in about thirty minutes . and see what we can come up with .
marketing executive : very good .","the meeting opens with the group doing introductions by giving their name and role . betty is the project manager , francina is the user interface specialist , eileen is the marketing expert , and jeanne is the industrial designer . the project manager tells them they will be designing a new remote control that should be original , trendy , and user-friendly . they will be concerned with functional , conceptional , and detailed design . to try out the whiteboard , each group member draws her favorite animal on the board . they discuss the project budget and then talk about their experiences with remote controls . they seemed to agree that the remote should be compact and have a multi-purpose functions . they also agree that it should do something different that current controls cannot do and that it should be made of different colors , materials , and shapes . they also discuss a way of helping people find the remote when it is lost- a signal , whether it is a beep or light . then they close the meeting with the project manager going over the tasks they are to complete and telling them they will meet again in about thirty minutes . the industrial designer will work on the working design and technical function . the interface specialist will do the working design and functional design . the marketing manager will look for user requirement specifications such as friendliness selling price will be twenty five euro . company aims to profit fifty million euro . it should be compact , multi-functional , different in shape/color/material . have a locator to help find the remote when it is lost . the group if not sure if they will have the budget to make the gadget multi-functional , but they would like to make one that would control basically all household machines .
","the project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animals on the white board and discussed why they liked those particular animals . the project manger talked about the project finances and the selling price of the remote is 25 euro ; the profit aim is 50 million euro , the range is unlimited and the production cost should be under 12 euro . after they finished the drawing exercise they discussed what features they would like to see in the remote , and discussed whether the remote should have a new design or if it should be multifunctional or just for televisions . they discussed changing the existing remote could be used only for TVs , but decided it was not necessary to include speech recognition . there was some confusion about what the remote was actually doing when lost and how to locate it .",x,,x,x,,,,,3.0,T5-Cons

marketing executive : so .
project manager : and everybody is name and what your function is ?
marketing executive : that is a good plan .
project manager : so maybe we start with you ?
user interface designer : my name is francina . and i am an user interface my role is the main responsibility is user interface .
project manager :  .
user interface designer : and my role is to design a television remote control .
marketing executive : and i am a marketing person . i wanna figure out how to sell them .
project manager : and your name is ?
marketing executive : my name is eileen .
industrial designer : . i am jeanne - oui . my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are deal with the technical - functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design .
project manager : very good . and as you already know i am betty . i am the project manager for today . so why do not we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do . yes y opening , acquaintance , tool training , the tools are , we already i the tool is really our the computer , as far as see .
marketing executive :  .
project manager : we get ins each of us will get instructions and we will take it from there . project plan , that falls under the same heading . , i do not think we have any great discussion at this point .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : here is what this thing should be . this thing we are gonna design is a new remote control . should be original , trendy , and , user friendly . so maybe you wanna make some notes of that . here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . that is it is gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we will discuss what we have come up with . the same goes for the conceptual design , there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards . detailed design , same thing .
marketing executive : so three different types of design that we are gonna be concerned with . functional , conception and detailed .
project manager : i ca not write with this thing .
marketing executive : maybe we should redesign it .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : after we have finished the remote control we will get to that .
project manager : . then , tool training try out the white board , participant can draw their favourite animal . does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? so that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board . you wanna go eileen and
marketing executive : i will see what do .
project manager : whether you without hanging yourself .
marketing executive : see if i r see if i remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit .
project manager : and remember you have to press so it works .
marketing executive : so that it will record . traditional kitty cat .
project manager : fat , a fat cat .
marketing executive : i have a very fat cat . and it likes to sit like that .
project manager : and you are francine , right ? would you like s like just to see how it feels , so that you have a little idea ?
user interface designer : yes , i am francina .
project manager : in
marketing executive : am i supposed to wipe off that or
project manager : no , no .
user interface designer : no , .
project manager : i , we will get to that later .
user interface designer : what should i draw ?
industrial designer : snake .
user interface designer : i am going to draw a snake . how does it look like ?
marketing executive : . i hope the kitty cat is hungry i do not like snakes .
project manager : here is the project finance which , we all have to think about when we design this thing . selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro . profit aim for the company is fifty million euro , the market range unlimited meaning international and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty euro .
marketing executive : that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged .
project manager : so these are all things , to remember with the budget and when you design to materials , cost , etcetera . now , the discussion i is does anyone of you have experience with remote control ? i exp i s we use 'em , right , everyday .
industrial designer : using remote control .
user interface designer : yes .
project manager : and now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you did not like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ? would you like it to be smaller , bigger , have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons , things like that ?
user interface designer : i yes , i feel that all the remote should be very compact .
project manager : small , right .
user interface designer : those which we get here nowadays it is very long . and and it should have multi - purpose . like the remote control which we use for t_v _ , it shou it should be used f for some other purpose also , like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air - conditioners , or for heating system .
industrial designer : audio player .
project manager : so it should be a multi - functional gadget that would control all your household machines .
user interface designer : yes , exactly
industrial designer : divides us
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : at twelve fifty euros per who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that . we certainly can try to i agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things .
project manager : it should be something new it should be s it should do something different than just what we have . now , the other thing to think there is maybe the design .
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : design should be , it should be different . all the almost all the remotes
project manager : like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy . maybe it should different colours or materials or .
user interface designer : yes , exactly .
industrial designer : maybe ten i do , colours
user interface designer : are different shapes .
industrial designer : and al shapes also .
project manager : so shapes right , like kidney shape feels better in your hand , .
marketing executive : friendly shape , that would help . another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap , because one of the big things that happens is people lose them . they ca not find it .
project manager : that is true , because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we , whatever . and and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the t_v _ off and they say , where the hell is my remote control ? or if it is really , if it is really in a dark spot that it gives out a sound or a signal .
marketing executive : so some
industrial designer : some beep like that ,
project manager : .
user interface designer : or a b
marketing executive : so , so it is really the beep or , or a light should blink .
industrial designer : so that we can go
project manager : so if lost if lost signal with b throw signal , .

project manager : my idea is maybe that the minute it is really hidden , in other words if it is like in a dark spot , meaning like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it is behind a plant , at that moment it is like , what you call it a light s sensors , ? in in that moment it has a sensor , i it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , that we can discuss that later , .

114,"project manager : is everybody ready ?
industrial designer : ?
marketing executive : i would to just put on my microphone here and i will be right with you .
project manager :  .
marketing executive : ?
project manager : i take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do
user interface designer : yes .
project manager : and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires .
marketing executive : you want me to start right now ?
project manager :  .
marketing executive : could you put my slides up it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time .
project manager : you are participant four .
marketing executive : i am participant four i believe .
project manager : and now full screen .
industrial designer : open .
project manager : .
marketing executive : there we go . we have introduced ourselves ,
industrial designer : and then full screen .
marketing executive : so the functional requirements are is part of my goal but why do not we pass right to the second slide . that is where m my discussion starts . right since i am in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since i have to try to sell it .
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason put that there like that is that in the init in the initial stage i should just be open to lots of suggestions . you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should turn on your c_d _ whatever you want it to do and then as we go on what we will have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility . so i will be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it is gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it is gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it is just something we ca not do . so in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in and then just weed things out that ca not be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to a customer we will try to then prioritise those . so that was what i meant there , and as i said on the slide there consulting the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , because if we are gonna sell this thing , the best time to sell it is as a christmas present . twenty five euros makes a little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase , we want somebody to see it and think it is , gee got ta have that . and take out their wallet and buy it . so it is got ta be really attractive and it but it is got ta go to market by september , anything that you do not already have out there in september showing it around , is not gonna sell for christmas . and then i will be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of the features and of the look and the colour and i will be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view . so i will be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you ,
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : and i will be coming to you to tell me what is gonna make somebody take out their wallet ,
user interface designer : what features .
marketing executive : what is gonna really be what they call a sizzle ,
user interface designer : s sellable .
marketing executive : we got ta sell this sizzle . a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view is not the thing that somebody is really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever . can we go to the next slide ? alright i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we are looking at the whole house idea really is not gonna be possible . so i would like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we could suggest anything . i would like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we will have a list of things we can cross off , not something like whole house control what will be and then i found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . at the budget that we are looking at and at the price point we are looking at , we should be able to make it work the t_v _ , the v_c_r _ , the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp .
project manager : can i at this point interject something ?
marketing executive : i have to wind up ?
project manager : we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered . the one thing something to eliminate maybe that is the teletext , because that is outdated with the internet , and according to higher management the it should only control the t_v _ , mostly because they feel that it is too comp complex a task to include other things ,
industrial designer : complicated , .
project manager : and they are concerned with the time to market . and the
marketing executive : so that is something
project manager : and the third thing that they wanna make that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , so that it is easy that they can be easily identified as a product of the company , and that there is no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out . so wanted to interject this here so we are not getting too much off track here with the things we wanna look at . these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate these things , so it is only gonna be t_v _ ,
marketing executive : so
project manager : but the one thing maybe that could be eliminated is the teletext idea .
marketing executive : alright , for that . alright now other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it is lost somewhere in the room . so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address , we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as maybe a beep , and that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate . , so , my personal preferences in this project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . that is the selling point , the thing that is gonna make it an impulse purchase . because once there is no be - back , in sales they always say , be - backs do not come back . if somebody says , i will come back and get it next week you are dead . they are never gonna come back and buy it . you have got ta make it attractive enough so they buy it now w now is a big word in my book for selling this thing . and , in order to make it really sellable we have got ta shorten the learning curve , make it is really intuitive and easy to use . we have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that is why i am saying , simplicity is good . finding it is important , you ca not use it if you ca not find it . so we have got ta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and i have already said this several times but i put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros . so it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , twenty five euros i am not gonna take that . has to be so great that they are gonna say , twenty five euros is not much . and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . that is about it for me right now .
project manager : and who would be next , i that would be you . you want me to get your slide show up ? and you are number three ?
industrial designer : number two ,
project manager : number two .
industrial designer : exactly . can you make it full screen ? no , it is like a you have to press here . the cup shape here ? the thir third .
project manager : there ,  .
industrial designer : so today i am going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . can you go to the next sli slide ? the metal is like in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . it takes the power from a battery say a battery it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to like switch connec connect your remote controller to power supply from the electricity like that . it should be a battery because remote controller should be like you should take it t to wherever you want and then th
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it is like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a t_v _ or a air conditioner , something like that so . a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like th the remote controller it sends some bits some waves like with a particular frequency the device should the frequency is . it should re recognise the waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel like that then the remote controller will send a se send a signal ,
marketing executive : signal .
industrial designer : and the t_v _ it should translate that into like change the channel like that , change the volume control
user interface designer : receive .
industrial designer : and so it is hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices .
user interface designer : multi - purpose .
project manager : yo and it is
marketing executive : that is already been eliminated by management , so we are off the hook .
project manager : but it is so .
industrial designer : so user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user in interface like switch pad like that buttons should be there . so you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you want to mute the t_v _ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there is a there should be some device to tell what to do to the in integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and t_v _ can perform the actions . so can you go to the next slide ? so would like to add some extra features to the remote controller these are the very simple features and they do not take much of the investment also , it is like el the text or buttons which are there on the remote controller they those we can make like fluorescent they will be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark . and ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it is this is not a action , there can be no action taking to that so . and there should be a child lock , like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they ca not be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they will be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . if make it useable for more than one device it is a it is hard but it is possible
project manager : that has been e that has been eliminated , so that is unfortunately a moot point now .
industrial designer : but it
marketing executive : we already eliminated that .
industrial designer : yeah
user interface designer : eliminated .
industrial designer : so it is , . and different shapes that we can do like we can have a all animals shapes or comfortable whi which can fit into your hands and so that
marketing executive : now that is good from a marketing point of view , the fun shape .
industrial designer : and colours also , different colours , and
project manager : i
user interface designer :  colours .
marketing executive : and that you say that wo not add too much to the budget ?
industrial designer : no no , it wo not i do not think it will be like ,
marketing executive : to d the shape is
industrial designer : you can have for if you want ther there to be more
project manager : it just build a mould and .
user interface designer : yes exactly .
industrial designer : it is it is just a s shape so it does not matter .
project manager : as the budget we are looking at if you build one mould i do not think that is going to make a big difference whether it is gonna be square or
marketing executive : do you think there is any chance of having ser in having the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ?
industrial designer : that is also possible i .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : is that gonna be a possible ? that might help with the marketing .
project manager : we will have to look at the budget on that
industrial designer : that will be
project manager : but in principle that would be fun , .
marketing executive : because we had something sexy for adults and we could have something
project manager : silly for children .
industrial designer : for children , exactly .
marketing executive : silly for children
project manager : like an animal or
marketing executive : or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is .
user interface designer : like a doll , or
industrial designer : that is what , . and and the butto buttons also if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated . if you have less features then your remote controller wo not be attractive , so we need to make some buttons which are like f in intended for two or three operations , like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but it will complicate the matter more so .
marketing executive : i think that is something that we will have to discuss with the user interface person
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : because there is a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . because one of the things were complaining about in my what i found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one . the changing modes was something
industrial designer : it is like .
marketing executive : you and i , all f all four of us we work with computers all the time , changing modes is nothing for us , but people who
project manager : a little elderly , a little arthritic hand ,
marketing executive : n and
project manager : and it is a small button and it they do not press it exactly something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : and they are very frustrated .
user interface designer : something else .
marketing executive : and that is and that is the thing people learn by feel , and you do not feel the mode change .
industrial designer : you do not us , usually .
marketing executive : so maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too .
industrial designer : shapes also , different shapes .
marketing executive : like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can develop a tactile sense of it .
industrial designer : that will
user interface designer : channels .
marketing executive : but we will get to that with you .
industrial designer : and also text should be very clear so that there wo not be any ambiguities and
marketing executive : . now that is a good point .
industrial designer : so . and display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it i do not think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it is
marketing executive : that is a good one ,
project manager :  ,  .
industrial designer : and we display a clock .
marketing executive : because the clock would be really friendly ,
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : and when is your favourite show coming on
industrial designer : and then you can just see your remote controller so
project manager : you are sitting there already or maybe you have no other
marketing executive : and , and a lot of time there is not a clock on the screen , and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute . that is good , the clock is good .
industrial designer : can you go to the next slide ? components the main components we need for it ha like buttons and underneath that there should be switch . like we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the t_v _ is on suppose , then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light . then it will be like if you switch on your t_v _ through anoth another source , not from through a remote controller and you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light . maybe we can have that . whenever the t_v _ is on , remote controller will have a light . and then infrared bulbs . this is like when it is dark . and battery , there should be a battery for power supply , and a chip , chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations , and wires connecting all chips , which is lights , everything , so there should be wires . and there should be a case where we can keep all the things and , different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape .
user interface designer : to keep the remote ?
marketing executive : case .
user interface designer : a case holder . a holder remote holder .
industrial designer : holder .
project manager : holder ,  .
industrial designer : can you move onto the next slide . next sli slide . i have referred the site the homepage of the our website , from where i have i got s few points . that is it , that is it from me now .
marketing executive : so it we should visit this site and have a look at what is up there ? or
project manager : you do not have to .
industrial designer : it is not like that , i have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so .
marketing executive : . so it might be helpful if we had a look at that .
industrial designer : if you want .
marketing executive : could you go back to that slide where she had that s slide up betsy ?
industrial designer : it is actually there now , there on the screen .
project manager : this one ?
marketing executive :
project manager : and francine ?
user interface designer : participant two .
project manager : you are number two ?
user interface designer : no no , i am three .
project manager : you are three . would you want it full screen ?
user interface designer : make it full ?
project manager :  ?
user interface designer : as user interface designer i did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote . can you go onto the next slide ? so i found out that but the main purpose of a remote is to f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance . now for that , a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the t_v _ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the t_v _ . there should be a signal something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a led which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume he can change it . now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular programme or switching on and off a particular programme according to the user choice .
project manager : on the on the remote .
user interface designer : yes . so if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the t_v _ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time .
project manager : right .
user interface designer : so he can use that properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children can not view that channel .
project manager : by your child ,  .
user interface designer : and the and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote . t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t_v _ television . and as this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t _ in alphabet for more compactability . and and it is one more point which i noted it down , like the material which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not any skin disease some al allergy to either children or to ad adult person . and it should have an it can have an alarm clock a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight p_m _ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock , and i do not think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote .
industrial designer : if there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock .
user interface designer : yes ,
marketing executive : and an alarm clock , that should be .
user interface designer : and as john reece said the buttons can be , can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different buttons will glow differently . so in even in the dark the user can buttons to use to switch on a particular channel . and the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote , he should not be harmed in any way . and findings , i found out y on different sites that there are different remotes which can be used , there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities , there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are so there you have different types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television . and these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use . not , no like it can be used as a t_v _ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock , and then to save electricity there should not be much s move lots of circuits and all that . and if a person if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it .
industrial designer : it is like a t , it is like a timer it is like a lock to the television .
project manager : timer ,  .
user interface designer : timer . and then you can use a timer as .
project manager : now i have on my slide show we already we have already done the agenda , and on the closing there will be lunch break and all that . however the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group . and what function , working design , how does it work . so these are the two things we should come up wit with . so the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on who is our target group . i in many ways everybody . everybody who has a t_v _ .
industrial designer : t_v _ , .
user interface designer : t_v _ television we was .
project manager : and today there are probably not many people who do not have a t_v _ .
industrial designer : do not t_v _ , .
project manager : there are a few but in general not . now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but within the target group we have subgroups . we have we have earlier it was mentioned about elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : so that is one group that is certainly important . then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it is really very clear . and i how much we want to cater to children is use . that is a question whether that is important that children can really use it or not . so this these are just some thoughts i have on it , and what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we are gonna design this one thing or whether we are looking at what we like we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups .
marketing executive : there is the old motto , children under six never shop alone . so if you have designed something that is very attractive to children the mummy we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing pull .
project manager : that has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but i am talking about the functionality now on it whether we are looking at different groups . the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours . , like you make it and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever
user interface designer : different colours .
marketing executive : you can make a banana shaped one .
project manager : but the question is really , who is our target group . do we look at one target group ? and with the twenty five euros can we afford to have i am asking the technical people here whether to look at subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect ?
marketing executive : respect .
user interface designer : no generally we can design a remote which is mainly for people with f age from ten to forty and then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes .
project manager : with with
industrial designer : we can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and .
project manager : that is
user interface designer : but in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they can not buy three different remotes .
industrial designer : children and everybody , .
user interface designer : they would like to buy just one and just one which can be used all the three
industrial designer : that we can do , but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you ca not really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different .
marketing executive : what about the electronics ? that is not really gonna change much , is it ?
user interface designer : cost effective .
industrial designer : no , it does not cost , .
project manager : no
marketing executive : that that w that wo not change much , will it ?
industrial designer : . does not does not matter .
project manager : the the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function ,
marketing executive : i d i would not .
project manager : and the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons , within the target group or subgroups . the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . the basic design i understand will be the same , but the question is how much will that set us back if let is say forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons . so that remains to s to be seen but the target group as a whole is everybody with a t_v _ .
marketing executive : and can we is it even feasible to make one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ?
project manager : that is the question .
marketing executive : the same electronics and all that is gonna be different is the plastic case . and in that case we could probabl moulded plastic is not all that expensive is it ?
industrial designer : no . , i do not think no .
marketing executive : you as an industrial person ?
project manager : maybe there is an idea t the new portable phones ? they have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever , and maybe something like that , that in each package you have you have let is say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package .
marketing executive : there is a real idea .
project manager : and then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately .
industrial designer : like for mobile phones we have different covers , like designs and all so that w we can have that .
marketing executive : right .
project manager : but like if then everybody is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package , then they can go to the store and for a few francs or euros whatever they can buy
marketing executive : an alternate package .
project manager : an alternate package with another two colours in it .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : but i have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people .
project manager : i think the idea here is to d design one remote
industrial designer : but
marketing executive : we can only aff ,
project manager : and what the only change is gonna be the funct d t
marketing executive : cosmetic .
user interface designer : of th .
project manager : the functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way , having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children five minutes that was i tha that is the old message .
marketing executive : warning , finish meeting now .
project manager : finish meeting now .
marketing executive : we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but
industrial designer : maybe , .
project manager : but
industrial designer : if we do some more research , maybe we .
project manager : to sum it up the target group is everybody . if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : do we agree , do we ?
industrial designer : maybe seventy percent is a unique remote controller and thirty percent is it is like .
marketing executive : but we have to l
project manager : do we agree on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not .
industrial designer : , .
marketing executive : fair enough .
project manager : ? so now i understand it is lunch break . so that is what we will do . so hank you very much . and we will see you after lunch .","the meeting begins and the marketing expert starts her presentation promptly , telling them that her research shows they need a focus- it is not possible to make a device that works on the whole house . the project manager steps in and informs them that they have instructions to eliminate the teletext idea because it is too complicated , and also said they must maintain the corporate image by using corporate designs and colors . the marketing expert resumes , talking about how remotes often get lost and that a light emitter might be useful . the industrial designer gives her presentation , talking about components , materials , and energy sources . they discuss giving the control different shapes to suit both adults and children , making the buttons various shapes , and putting a display clock on the control . the interface designer presents , talking about the features users like on a remote and suggesting that they make the remote a t-shape and add an alarm clock function . they discuss their target group and the possibility of removable plastic cases . they close the meeting deciding to do more research on the plastic cases . they cannot make a device that works on the whole house- will need a focus . they will eliminate teletext . they will maintain the corporate image by using the proper designs and colors . their target group is basically everybody who owns a tv . they are concerned about making the control marketable to a wide range of age groups , and have discussed making removable plastic covers so that the look is changeable . however , they need to do more research on this topic . they do not know if their budget will allow them to include all the features they would like to such as a light emitter , clock , alarm clock , and child lock .
",the project manager introduced the project to the group and gave the group instructions as to what they would do before the next meeting . the industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the team discussed various features they could include in order to make the remote more user-friendly . the marketing expert presented consumer preferences and requirements and discussed the possibility of including an lcd screen . the user interface designer presented existing remote controls on the market and discussed what features in terms of appearance and functionality the remote the team is creating should include . the group discussed the features they would like to include in the remote . they discussed including a battery charging stand with the remote but decided that it was not a feature they wanted to include . they also discussed how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the design . the team decided that the remote will be small with a locator function instead of having a charging stand . they had some difficulties figuring out the cost of adding a feature to the remote and eventually decided that they could not afford it . they did not have time to evaluate the project process before the end of the meeting .,x,,x,x,,,,,3.0,BART-Baseline
115,"project manager : is everybody ready ?
industrial designer : ?
marketing executive : i would to just put on my microphone here and i will be right with you .
project manager :  .
marketing executive : ?
project manager : i take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do
user interface designer : yes .
project manager : and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires .
marketing executive : you want me to start right now ?
project manager :  .
marketing executive : could you put my slides up it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time .
project manager : you are participant four .
marketing executive : i am participant four i believe .
project manager : and now full screen .
industrial designer : open .
project manager : .
marketing executive : there we go . we have introduced ourselves ,
industrial designer : and then full screen .
marketing executive : so the functional requirements are is part of my goal but why do not we pass right to the second slide . that is where m my discussion starts . right since i am in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since i have to try to sell it .
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason put that there like that is that in the init in the initial stage i should just be open to lots of suggestions . you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should turn on your c_d _ whatever you want it to do and then as we go on what we will have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility . so i will be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it is gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it is gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it is just something we ca not do . so in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in and then just weed things out that ca not be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to a customer we will try to then prioritise those . so that was what i meant there , and as i said on the slide there consulting the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , because if we are gonna sell this thing , the best time to sell it is as a christmas present . twenty five euros makes a little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase , we want somebody to see it and think it is , gee got ta have that . and take out their wallet and buy it . so it is got ta be really attractive and it but it is got ta go to market by september , anything that you do not already have out there in september showing it around , is not gonna sell for christmas . and then i will be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of the features and of the look and the colour and i will be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view . so i will be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you ,
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : and i will be coming to you to tell me what is gonna make somebody take out their wallet ,
user interface designer : what features .
marketing executive : what is gonna really be what they call a sizzle ,
user interface designer : s sellable .
marketing executive : we got ta sell this sizzle . a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view is not the thing that somebody is really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever . can we go to the next slide ? alright i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we are looking at the whole house idea really is not gonna be possible . so i would like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we could suggest anything . i would like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we will have a list of things we can cross off , not something like whole house control what will be and then i found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . at the budget that we are looking at and at the price point we are looking at , we should be able to make it work the t_v _ , the v_c_r _ , the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp .
project manager : can i at this point interject something ?
marketing executive : i have to wind up ?
project manager : we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered . the one thing something to eliminate maybe that is the teletext , because that is outdated with the internet , and according to higher management the it should only control the t_v _ , mostly because they feel that it is too comp complex a task to include other things ,
industrial designer : complicated , .
project manager : and they are concerned with the time to market . and the
marketing executive : so that is something
project manager : and the third thing that they wanna make that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , so that it is easy that they can be easily identified as a product of the company , and that there is no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out . so wanted to interject this here so we are not getting too much off track here with the things we wanna look at . these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate these things , so it is only gonna be t_v _ ,
marketing executive : so
project manager : but the one thing maybe that could be eliminated is the teletext idea .
marketing executive : alright , for that . alright now other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it is lost somewhere in the room . so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address , we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as maybe a beep , and that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate . , so , my personal preferences in this project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . that is the selling point , the thing that is gonna make it an impulse purchase . because once there is no be - back , in sales they always say , be - backs do not come back . if somebody says , i will come back and get it next week you are dead . they are never gonna come back and buy it . you have got ta make it attractive enough so they buy it now w now is a big word in my book for selling this thing . and , in order to make it really sellable we have got ta shorten the learning curve , make it is really intuitive and easy to use . we have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that is why i am saying , simplicity is good . finding it is important , you ca not use it if you ca not find it . so we have got ta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and i have already said this several times but i put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros . so it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , twenty five euros i am not gonna take that . has to be so great that they are gonna say , twenty five euros is not much . and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . that is about it for me right now .
project manager : and who would be next , i that would be you . you want me to get your slide show up ? and you are number three ?
industrial designer : number two ,
project manager : number two .
industrial designer : exactly . can you make it full screen ? no , it is like a you have to press here . the cup shape here ? the thir third .
project manager : there ,  .
industrial designer : so today i am going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . can you go to the next sli slide ? the metal is like in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . it takes the power from a battery say a battery it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to like switch connec connect your remote controller to power supply from the electricity like that . it should be a battery because remote controller should be like you should take it t to wherever you want and then th
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it is like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a t_v _ or a air conditioner , something like that so . a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like th the remote controller it sends some bits some waves like with a particular frequency the device should the frequency is . it should re recognise the waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel like that then the remote controller will send a se send a signal ,
marketing executive : signal .
industrial designer : and the t_v _ it should translate that into like change the channel like that , change the volume control
user interface designer : receive .
industrial designer : and so it is hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices .
user interface designer : multi - purpose .
project manager : yo and it is
marketing executive : that is already been eliminated by management , so we are off the hook .
project manager : but it is so .
industrial designer : so user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user in interface like switch pad like that buttons should be there . so you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you want to mute the t_v _ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there is a there should be some device to tell what to do to the in integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and t_v _ can perform the actions . so can you go to the next slide ? so would like to add some extra features to the remote controller these are the very simple features and they do not take much of the investment also , it is like el the text or buttons which are there on the remote controller they those we can make like fluorescent they will be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark . and ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it is this is not a action , there can be no action taking to that so . and there should be a child lock , like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they ca not be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they will be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . if make it useable for more than one device it is a it is hard but it is possible
project manager : that has been e that has been eliminated , so that is unfortunately a moot point now .
industrial designer : but it
marketing executive : we already eliminated that .
industrial designer : yeah
user interface designer : eliminated .
industrial designer : so it is , . and different shapes that we can do like we can have a all animals shapes or comfortable whi which can fit into your hands and so that
marketing executive : now that is good from a marketing point of view , the fun shape .
industrial designer : and colours also , different colours , and
project manager : i
user interface designer :  colours .
marketing executive : and that you say that wo not add too much to the budget ?
industrial designer : no no , it wo not i do not think it will be like ,
marketing executive : to d the shape is
industrial designer : you can have for if you want ther there to be more
project manager : it just build a mould and .
user interface designer : yes exactly .
industrial designer : it is it is just a s shape so it does not matter .
project manager : as the budget we are looking at if you build one mould i do not think that is going to make a big difference whether it is gonna be square or
marketing executive : do you think there is any chance of having ser in having the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ?
industrial designer : that is also possible i .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : is that gonna be a possible ? that might help with the marketing .
project manager : we will have to look at the budget on that
industrial designer : that will be
project manager : but in principle that would be fun , .
marketing executive : because we had something sexy for adults and we could have something
project manager : silly for children .
industrial designer : for children , exactly .
marketing executive : silly for children
project manager : like an animal or
marketing executive : or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is .
user interface designer : like a doll , or
industrial designer : that is what , . and and the butto buttons also if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated . if you have less features then your remote controller wo not be attractive , so we need to make some buttons which are like f in intended for two or three operations , like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but it will complicate the matter more so .
marketing executive : i think that is something that we will have to discuss with the user interface person
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : because there is a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . because one of the things were complaining about in my what i found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one . the changing modes was something
industrial designer : it is like .
marketing executive : you and i , all f all four of us we work with computers all the time , changing modes is nothing for us , but people who
project manager : a little elderly , a little arthritic hand ,
marketing executive : n and
project manager : and it is a small button and it they do not press it exactly something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : and they are very frustrated .
user interface designer : something else .
marketing executive : and that is and that is the thing people learn by feel , and you do not feel the mode change .
industrial designer : you do not us , usually .
marketing executive : so maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too .
industrial designer : shapes also , different shapes .
marketing executive : like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can develop a tactile sense of it .
industrial designer : that will
user interface designer : channels .
marketing executive : but we will get to that with you .
industrial designer : and also text should be very clear so that there wo not be any ambiguities and
marketing executive : . now that is a good point .
industrial designer : so . and display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it i do not think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it is
marketing executive : that is a good one ,
project manager :  ,  .
industrial designer : and we display a clock .
marketing executive : because the clock would be really friendly ,
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : and when is your favourite show coming on
industrial designer : and then you can just see your remote controller so
project manager : you are sitting there already or maybe you have no other
marketing executive : and , and a lot of time there is not a clock on the screen , and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute . that is good , the clock is good .
industrial designer : can you go to the next slide ? components the main components we need for it ha like buttons and underneath that there should be switch . like we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the t_v _ is on suppose , then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light . then it will be like if you switch on your t_v _ through anoth another source , not from through a remote controller and you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light . maybe we can have that . whenever the t_v _ is on , remote controller will have a light . and then infrared bulbs . this is like when it is dark . and battery , there should be a battery for power supply , and a chip , chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations , and wires connecting all chips , which is lights , everything , so there should be wires . and there should be a case where we can keep all the things and , different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape .
user interface designer : to keep the remote ?
marketing executive : case .
user interface designer : a case holder . a holder remote holder .
industrial designer : holder .
project manager : holder ,  .
industrial designer : can you move onto the next slide . next sli slide . i have referred the site the homepage of the our website , from where i have i got s few points . that is it , that is it from me now .
marketing executive : so it we should visit this site and have a look at what is up there ? or
project manager : you do not have to .
industrial designer : it is not like that , i have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so .
marketing executive : . so it might be helpful if we had a look at that .
industrial designer : if you want .
marketing executive : could you go back to that slide where she had that s slide up betsy ?
industrial designer : it is actually there now , there on the screen .
project manager : this one ?
marketing executive :
project manager : and francine ?
user interface designer : participant two .
project manager : you are number two ?
user interface designer : no no , i am three .
project manager : you are three . would you want it full screen ?
user interface designer : make it full ?
project manager :  ?
user interface designer : as user interface designer i did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote . can you go onto the next slide ? so i found out that but the main purpose of a remote is to f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance . now for that , a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the t_v _ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the t_v _ . there should be a signal something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a led which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume he can change it . now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular programme or switching on and off a particular programme according to the user choice .
project manager : on the on the remote .
user interface designer : yes . so if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the t_v _ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time .
project manager : right .
user interface designer : so he can use that properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children can not view that channel .
project manager : by your child ,  .
user interface designer : and the and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote . t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t_v _ television . and as this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t _ in alphabet for more compactability . and and it is one more point which i noted it down , like the material which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not any skin disease some al allergy to either children or to ad adult person . and it should have an it can have an alarm clock a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight p_m _ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock , and i do not think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote .
industrial designer : if there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock .
user interface designer : yes ,
marketing executive : and an alarm clock , that should be .
user interface designer : and as john reece said the buttons can be , can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different buttons will glow differently . so in even in the dark the user can buttons to use to switch on a particular channel . and the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote , he should not be harmed in any way . and findings , i found out y on different sites that there are different remotes which can be used , there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities , there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are so there you have different types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television . and these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use . not , no like it can be used as a t_v _ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock , and then to save electricity there should not be much s move lots of circuits and all that . and if a person if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it .
industrial designer : it is like a t , it is like a timer it is like a lock to the television .
project manager : timer ,  .
user interface designer : timer . and then you can use a timer as .
project manager : now i have on my slide show we already we have already done the agenda , and on the closing there will be lunch break and all that . however the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group . and what function , working design , how does it work . so these are the two things we should come up wit with . so the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on who is our target group . i in many ways everybody . everybody who has a t_v _ .
industrial designer : t_v _ , .
user interface designer : t_v _ television we was .
project manager : and today there are probably not many people who do not have a t_v _ .
industrial designer : do not t_v _ , .
project manager : there are a few but in general not . now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but within the target group we have subgroups . we have we have earlier it was mentioned about elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : so that is one group that is certainly important . then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it is really very clear . and i how much we want to cater to children is use . that is a question whether that is important that children can really use it or not . so this these are just some thoughts i have on it , and what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we are gonna design this one thing or whether we are looking at what we like we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups .
marketing executive : there is the old motto , children under six never shop alone . so if you have designed something that is very attractive to children the mummy we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing pull .
project manager : that has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but i am talking about the functionality now on it whether we are looking at different groups . the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours . , like you make it and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever
user interface designer : different colours .
marketing executive : you can make a banana shaped one .
project manager : but the question is really , who is our target group . do we look at one target group ? and with the twenty five euros can we afford to have i am asking the technical people here whether to look at subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect ?
marketing executive : respect .
user interface designer : no generally we can design a remote which is mainly for people with f age from ten to forty and then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes .
project manager : with with
industrial designer : we can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and .
project manager : that is
user interface designer : but in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they can not buy three different remotes .
industrial designer : children and everybody , .
user interface designer : they would like to buy just one and just one which can be used all the three
industrial designer : that we can do , but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you ca not really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different .
marketing executive : what about the electronics ? that is not really gonna change much , is it ?
user interface designer : cost effective .
industrial designer : no , it does not cost , .
project manager : no
marketing executive : that that w that wo not change much , will it ?
industrial designer : . does not does not matter .
project manager : the the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function ,
marketing executive : i d i would not .
project manager : and the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons , within the target group or subgroups . the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . the basic design i understand will be the same , but the question is how much will that set us back if let is say forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons . so that remains to s to be seen but the target group as a whole is everybody with a t_v _ .
marketing executive : and can we is it even feasible to make one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ?
project manager : that is the question .
marketing executive : the same electronics and all that is gonna be different is the plastic case . and in that case we could probabl moulded plastic is not all that expensive is it ?
industrial designer : no . , i do not think no .
marketing executive : you as an industrial person ?
project manager : maybe there is an idea t the new portable phones ? they have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever , and maybe something like that , that in each package you have you have let is say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package .
marketing executive : there is a real idea .
project manager : and then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately .
industrial designer : like for mobile phones we have different covers , like designs and all so that w we can have that .
marketing executive : right .
project manager : but like if then everybody is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package , then they can go to the store and for a few francs or euros whatever they can buy
marketing executive : an alternate package .
project manager : an alternate package with another two colours in it .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : but i have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people .
project manager : i think the idea here is to d design one remote
industrial designer : but
marketing executive : we can only aff ,
project manager : and what the only change is gonna be the funct d t
marketing executive : cosmetic .
user interface designer : of th .
project manager : the functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way , having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children five minutes that was i tha that is the old message .
marketing executive : warning , finish meeting now .
project manager : finish meeting now .
marketing executive : we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but
industrial designer : maybe , .
project manager : but
industrial designer : if we do some more research , maybe we .
project manager : to sum it up the target group is everybody . if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : do we agree , do we ?
industrial designer : maybe seventy percent is a unique remote controller and thirty percent is it is like .
marketing executive : but we have to l
project manager : do we agree on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not .
industrial designer : , .
marketing executive : fair enough .
project manager : ? so now i understand it is lunch break . so that is what we will do . so hank you very much . and we will see you after lunch .","the meeting begins and the marketing expert starts her presentation promptly , telling them that her research shows they need a focus- it is not possible to make a device that works on the whole house . the project manager steps in and informs them that they have instructions to eliminate the teletext idea because it is too complicated , and also said they must maintain the corporate image by using corporate designs and colors . the marketing expert resumes , talking about how remotes often get lost and that a light emitter might be useful . the industrial designer gives her presentation , talking about components , materials , and energy sources . they discuss giving the control different shapes to suit both adults and children , making the buttons various shapes , and putting a display clock on the control . the interface designer presents , talking about the features users like on a remote and suggesting that they make the remote a t-shape and add an alarm clock function . they discuss their target group and the possibility of removable plastic cases . they close the meeting deciding to do more research on the plastic cases . they cannot make a device that works on the whole house- will need a focus . they will eliminate teletext . they will maintain the corporate image by using the proper designs and colors . their target group is basically everybody who owns a tv . they are concerned about making the control marketable to a wide range of age groups , and have discussed making removable plastic covers so that the look is changeable . however , they need to do more research on this topic . they do not know if their budget will allow them to include all the features they would like to such as a light emitter , clock , alarm clock , and child lock .
","the project manager introduced the upcoming project to the group and gave the agenda for the rest of the project . the group introduced themselves to each other and trained themselves how to use the meeting room equipment . the marketing expert began presenting research on consumer preferences and requirements for remotes . she discussed making the remote universally compatible and ergonomically-designed , and suggested including a battery charging stand with the remote . the industrial designer presented his internal design of the device and discussed the restrictions involved in combining various components . the interface specialist presented the requirements of users and presented several ideas for the device . she suggested including an lcd screen and a base station with a locator function . the program manager gave the group their assignments and instructed them to work together on the project evaluation . all participants participated in a discussion in which they discussed their experiences with remotes and what features they would like to see in the remote the remote control will have . the team discussed the features that will be incorporated into the remote and decided that the remote will be moderately-sized and will not have a large number of buttons . the manager instructed the user interface designer to work on the technical functions of the remote , and the marketing specialist to prepare a trendwatching report . the user Interface designer will work on what functions the remote controls have and will try to find the most user-friendly settings possible . the remote manager will prepare a report containing the summary of the meeting proceedings , including the evaluation of the group's work together . the industial",x,x,x,,,,,,5.0,BART-Cons
116,"project manager : is everybody ready ?
industrial designer : ?
marketing executive : i would to just put on my microphone here and i will be right with you .
project manager :  .
marketing executive : ?
project manager : i take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do
user interface designer : yes .
project manager : and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires .
marketing executive : you want me to start right now ?
project manager :  .
marketing executive : could you put my slides up it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time .
project manager : you are participant four .
marketing executive : i am participant four i believe .
project manager : and now full screen .
industrial designer : open .
project manager : .
marketing executive : there we go . we have introduced ourselves ,
industrial designer : and then full screen .
marketing executive : so the functional requirements are is part of my goal but why do not we pass right to the second slide . that is where m my discussion starts . right since i am in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since i have to try to sell it .
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason put that there like that is that in the init in the initial stage i should just be open to lots of suggestions . you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should turn on your c_d _ whatever you want it to do and then as we go on what we will have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility . so i will be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it is gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it is gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it is just something we ca not do . so in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in and then just weed things out that ca not be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to a customer we will try to then prioritise those . so that was what i meant there , and as i said on the slide there consulting the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , because if we are gonna sell this thing , the best time to sell it is as a christmas present . twenty five euros makes a little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase , we want somebody to see it and think it is , gee got ta have that . and take out their wallet and buy it . so it is got ta be really attractive and it but it is got ta go to market by september , anything that you do not already have out there in september showing it around , is not gonna sell for christmas . and then i will be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of the features and of the look and the colour and i will be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view . so i will be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you ,
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : and i will be coming to you to tell me what is gonna make somebody take out their wallet ,
user interface designer : what features .
marketing executive : what is gonna really be what they call a sizzle ,
user interface designer : s sellable .
marketing executive : we got ta sell this sizzle . a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view is not the thing that somebody is really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever . can we go to the next slide ? alright i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we are looking at the whole house idea really is not gonna be possible . so i would like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we could suggest anything . i would like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we will have a list of things we can cross off , not something like whole house control what will be and then i found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . at the budget that we are looking at and at the price point we are looking at , we should be able to make it work the t_v _ , the v_c_r _ , the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp .
project manager : can i at this point interject something ?
marketing executive : i have to wind up ?
project manager : we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered . the one thing something to eliminate maybe that is the teletext , because that is outdated with the internet , and according to higher management the it should only control the t_v _ , mostly because they feel that it is too comp complex a task to include other things ,
industrial designer : complicated , .
project manager : and they are concerned with the time to market . and the
marketing executive : so that is something
project manager : and the third thing that they wanna make that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , so that it is easy that they can be easily identified as a product of the company , and that there is no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out . so wanted to interject this here so we are not getting too much off track here with the things we wanna look at . these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate these things , so it is only gonna be t_v _ ,
marketing executive : so
project manager : but the one thing maybe that could be eliminated is the teletext idea .
marketing executive : alright , for that . alright now other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it is lost somewhere in the room . so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address , we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as maybe a beep , and that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate . , so , my personal preferences in this project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . that is the selling point , the thing that is gonna make it an impulse purchase . because once there is no be - back , in sales they always say , be - backs do not come back . if somebody says , i will come back and get it next week you are dead . they are never gonna come back and buy it . you have got ta make it attractive enough so they buy it now w now is a big word in my book for selling this thing . and , in order to make it really sellable we have got ta shorten the learning curve , make it is really intuitive and easy to use . we have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that is why i am saying , simplicity is good . finding it is important , you ca not use it if you ca not find it . so we have got ta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and i have already said this several times but i put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros . so it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , twenty five euros i am not gonna take that . has to be so great that they are gonna say , twenty five euros is not much . and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . that is about it for me right now .
project manager : and who would be next , i that would be you . you want me to get your slide show up ? and you are number three ?
industrial designer : number two ,
project manager : number two .
industrial designer : exactly . can you make it full screen ? no , it is like a you have to press here . the cup shape here ? the thir third .
project manager : there ,  .
industrial designer : so today i am going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . can you go to the next sli slide ? the metal is like in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . it takes the power from a battery say a battery it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to like switch connec connect your remote controller to power supply from the electricity like that . it should be a battery because remote controller should be like you should take it t to wherever you want and then th
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it is like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a t_v _ or a air conditioner , something like that so . a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like th the remote controller it sends some bits some waves like with a particular frequency the device should the frequency is . it should re recognise the waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel like that then the remote controller will send a se send a signal ,
marketing executive : signal .
industrial designer : and the t_v _ it should translate that into like change the channel like that , change the volume control
user interface designer : receive .
industrial designer : and so it is hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices .
user interface designer : multi - purpose .
project manager : yo and it is
marketing executive : that is already been eliminated by management , so we are off the hook .
project manager : but it is so .
industrial designer : so user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user in interface like switch pad like that buttons should be there . so you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you want to mute the t_v _ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there is a there should be some device to tell what to do to the in integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and t_v _ can perform the actions . so can you go to the next slide ? so would like to add some extra features to the remote controller these are the very simple features and they do not take much of the investment also , it is like el the text or buttons which are there on the remote controller they those we can make like fluorescent they will be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark . and ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it is this is not a action , there can be no action taking to that so . and there should be a child lock , like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they ca not be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they will be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . if make it useable for more than one device it is a it is hard but it is possible
project manager : that has been e that has been eliminated , so that is unfortunately a moot point now .
industrial designer : but it
marketing executive : we already eliminated that .
industrial designer : yeah
user interface designer : eliminated .
industrial designer : so it is , . and different shapes that we can do like we can have a all animals shapes or comfortable whi which can fit into your hands and so that
marketing executive : now that is good from a marketing point of view , the fun shape .
industrial designer : and colours also , different colours , and
project manager : i
user interface designer :  colours .
marketing executive : and that you say that wo not add too much to the budget ?
industrial designer : no no , it wo not i do not think it will be like ,
marketing executive : to d the shape is
industrial designer : you can have for if you want ther there to be more
project manager : it just build a mould and .
user interface designer : yes exactly .
industrial designer : it is it is just a s shape so it does not matter .
project manager : as the budget we are looking at if you build one mould i do not think that is going to make a big difference whether it is gonna be square or
marketing executive : do you think there is any chance of having ser in having the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ?
industrial designer : that is also possible i .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : is that gonna be a possible ? that might help with the marketing .
project manager : we will have to look at the budget on that
industrial designer : that will be
project manager : but in principle that would be fun , .
marketing executive : because we had something sexy for adults and we could have something
project manager : silly for children .
industrial designer : for children , exactly .
marketing executive : silly for children
project manager : like an animal or
marketing executive : or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is .
user interface designer : like a doll , or
industrial designer : that is what , . and and the butto buttons also if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated . if you have less features then your remote controller wo not be attractive , so we need to make some buttons which are like f in intended for two or three operations , like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but it will complicate the matter more so .
marketing executive : i think that is something that we will have to discuss with the user interface person
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : because there is a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . because one of the things were complaining about in my what i found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one . the changing modes was something
industrial designer : it is like .
marketing executive : you and i , all f all four of us we work with computers all the time , changing modes is nothing for us , but people who
project manager : a little elderly , a little arthritic hand ,
marketing executive : n and
project manager : and it is a small button and it they do not press it exactly something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : and they are very frustrated .
user interface designer : something else .
marketing executive : and that is and that is the thing people learn by feel , and you do not feel the mode change .
industrial designer : you do not us , usually .
marketing executive : so maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too .
industrial designer : shapes also , different shapes .
marketing executive : like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can develop a tactile sense of it .
industrial designer : that will
user interface designer : channels .
marketing executive : but we will get to that with you .
industrial designer : and also text should be very clear so that there wo not be any ambiguities and
marketing executive : . now that is a good point .
industrial designer : so . and display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it i do not think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it is
marketing executive : that is a good one ,
project manager :  ,  .
industrial designer : and we display a clock .
marketing executive : because the clock would be really friendly ,
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : and when is your favourite show coming on
industrial designer : and then you can just see your remote controller so
project manager : you are sitting there already or maybe you have no other
marketing executive : and , and a lot of time there is not a clock on the screen , and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute . that is good , the clock is good .
industrial designer : can you go to the next slide ? components the main components we need for it ha like buttons and underneath that there should be switch . like we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the t_v _ is on suppose , then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light . then it will be like if you switch on your t_v _ through anoth another source , not from through a remote controller and you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light . maybe we can have that . whenever the t_v _ is on , remote controller will have a light . and then infrared bulbs . this is like when it is dark . and battery , there should be a battery for power supply , and a chip , chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations , and wires connecting all chips , which is lights , everything , so there should be wires . and there should be a case where we can keep all the things and , different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape .
user interface designer : to keep the remote ?
marketing executive : case .
user interface designer : a case holder . a holder remote holder .
industrial designer : holder .
project manager : holder ,  .
industrial designer : can you move onto the next slide . next sli slide . i have referred the site the homepage of the our website , from where i have i got s few points . that is it , that is it from me now .
marketing executive : so it we should visit this site and have a look at what is up there ? or
project manager : you do not have to .
industrial designer : it is not like that , i have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so .
marketing executive : . so it might be helpful if we had a look at that .
industrial designer : if you want .
marketing executive : could you go back to that slide where she had that s slide up betsy ?
industrial designer : it is actually there now , there on the screen .
project manager : this one ?
marketing executive :
project manager : and francine ?
user interface designer : participant two .
project manager : you are number two ?
user interface designer : no no , i am three .
project manager : you are three . would you want it full screen ?
user interface designer : make it full ?
project manager :  ?
user interface designer : as user interface designer i did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote . can you go onto the next slide ? so i found out that but the main purpose of a remote is to f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance . now for that , a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the t_v _ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the t_v _ . there should be a signal something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a led which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume he can change it . now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular programme or switching on and off a particular programme according to the user choice .
project manager : on the on the remote .
user interface designer : yes . so if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the t_v _ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time .
project manager : right .
user interface designer : so he can use that properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children can not view that channel .
project manager : by your child ,  .
user interface designer : and the and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote . t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t_v _ television . and as this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t _ in alphabet for more compactability . and and it is one more point which i noted it down , like the material which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not any skin disease some al allergy to either children or to ad adult person . and it should have an it can have an alarm clock a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight p_m _ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock , and i do not think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote .
industrial designer : if there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock .
user interface designer : yes ,
marketing executive : and an alarm clock , that should be .
user interface designer : and as john reece said the buttons can be , can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different buttons will glow differently . so in even in the dark the user can buttons to use to switch on a particular channel . and the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote , he should not be harmed in any way . and findings , i found out y on different sites that there are different remotes which can be used , there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities , there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are so there you have different types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television . and these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use . not , no like it can be used as a t_v _ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock , and then to save electricity there should not be much s move lots of circuits and all that . and if a person if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it .
industrial designer : it is like a t , it is like a timer it is like a lock to the television .
project manager : timer ,  .
user interface designer : timer . and then you can use a timer as .
project manager : now i have on my slide show we already we have already done the agenda , and on the closing there will be lunch break and all that . however the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group . and what function , working design , how does it work . so these are the two things we should come up wit with . so the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on who is our target group . i in many ways everybody . everybody who has a t_v _ .
industrial designer : t_v _ , .
user interface designer : t_v _ television we was .
project manager : and today there are probably not many people who do not have a t_v _ .
industrial designer : do not t_v _ , .
project manager : there are a few but in general not . now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but within the target group we have subgroups . we have we have earlier it was mentioned about elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : so that is one group that is certainly important . then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it is really very clear . and i how much we want to cater to children is use . that is a question whether that is important that children can really use it or not . so this these are just some thoughts i have on it , and what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we are gonna design this one thing or whether we are looking at what we like we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups .
marketing executive : there is the old motto , children under six never shop alone . so if you have designed something that is very attractive to children the mummy we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing pull .
project manager : that has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but i am talking about the functionality now on it whether we are looking at different groups . the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours . , like you make it and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever
user interface designer : different colours .
marketing executive : you can make a banana shaped one .
project manager : but the question is really , who is our target group . do we look at one target group ? and with the twenty five euros can we afford to have i am asking the technical people here whether to look at subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect ?
marketing executive : respect .
user interface designer : no generally we can design a remote which is mainly for people with f age from ten to forty and then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes .
project manager : with with
industrial designer : we can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and .
project manager : that is
user interface designer : but in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they can not buy three different remotes .
industrial designer : children and everybody , .
user interface designer : they would like to buy just one and just one which can be used all the three
industrial designer : that we can do , but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you ca not really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different .
marketing executive : what about the electronics ? that is not really gonna change much , is it ?
user interface designer : cost effective .
industrial designer : no , it does not cost , .
project manager : no
marketing executive : that that w that wo not change much , will it ?
industrial designer : . does not does not matter .
project manager : the the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function ,
marketing executive : i d i would not .
project manager : and the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons , within the target group or subgroups . the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . the basic design i understand will be the same , but the question is how much will that set us back if let is say forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons . so that remains to s to be seen but the target group as a whole is everybody with a t_v _ .
marketing executive : and can we is it even feasible to make one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ?
project manager : that is the question .
marketing executive : the same electronics and all that is gonna be different is the plastic case . and in that case we could probabl moulded plastic is not all that expensive is it ?
industrial designer : no . , i do not think no .
marketing executive : you as an industrial person ?
project manager : maybe there is an idea t the new portable phones ? they have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever , and maybe something like that , that in each package you have you have let is say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package .
marketing executive : there is a real idea .
project manager : and then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately .
industrial designer : like for mobile phones we have different covers , like designs and all so that w we can have that .
marketing executive : right .
project manager : but like if then everybody is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package , then they can go to the store and for a few francs or euros whatever they can buy
marketing executive : an alternate package .
project manager : an alternate package with another two colours in it .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : but i have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people .
project manager : i think the idea here is to d design one remote
industrial designer : but
marketing executive : we can only aff ,
project manager : and what the only change is gonna be the funct d t
marketing executive : cosmetic .
user interface designer : of th .
project manager : the functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way , having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children five minutes that was i tha that is the old message .
marketing executive : warning , finish meeting now .
project manager : finish meeting now .
marketing executive : we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but
industrial designer : maybe , .
project manager : but
industrial designer : if we do some more research , maybe we .
project manager : to sum it up the target group is everybody . if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : do we agree , do we ?
industrial designer : maybe seventy percent is a unique remote controller and thirty percent is it is like .
marketing executive : but we have to l
project manager : do we agree on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not .
industrial designer : , .
marketing executive : fair enough .
project manager : ? so now i understand it is lunch break . so that is what we will do . so hank you very much . and we will see you after lunch .","the meeting begins and the marketing expert starts her presentation promptly , telling them that her research shows they need a focus- it is not possible to make a device that works on the whole house . the project manager steps in and informs them that they have instructions to eliminate the teletext idea because it is too complicated , and also said they must maintain the corporate image by using corporate designs and colors . the marketing expert resumes , talking about how remotes often get lost and that a light emitter might be useful . the industrial designer gives her presentation , talking about components , materials , and energy sources . they discuss giving the control different shapes to suit both adults and children , making the buttons various shapes , and putting a display clock on the control . the interface designer presents , talking about the features users like on a remote and suggesting that they make the remote a t-shape and add an alarm clock function . they discuss their target group and the possibility of removable plastic cases . they close the meeting deciding to do more research on the plastic cases . they cannot make a device that works on the whole house- will need a focus . they will eliminate teletext . they will maintain the corporate image by using the proper designs and colors . their target group is basically everybody who owns a tv . they are concerned about making the control marketable to a wide range of age groups , and have discussed making removable plastic covers so that the look is changeable . however , they need to do more research on this topic . they do not know if their budget will allow them to include all the features they would like to such as a light emitter , clock , alarm clock , and child lock .
","the marketing expert introduced himself to the group and discussed his role in the project . he discussed the needs and desires of the target group . the industrial designer discussed the costs and time involved in developing the product , and the user interface designer discussed what features the product should include and what features should be prioritized based on their appeal to target groups . they discussed the look and feel of the product and decided that a whole house design was not feasible within the budget . after a discussion of the features to include , the group decided that the design should include in the product to be sold as , it should be attractive , be able , have a spongy feel , has to be a touch-screen display , a button to make it easy to use , but it is not possible to put in a pocket-friendly design .",x,,x,,,,,,2.0,T5-Baseline
117,"project manager : is everybody ready ?
industrial designer : ?
marketing executive : i would to just put on my microphone here and i will be right with you .
project manager :  .
marketing executive : ?
project manager : i take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do
user interface designer : yes .
project manager : and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires .
marketing executive : you want me to start right now ?
project manager :  .
marketing executive : could you put my slides up it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time .
project manager : you are participant four .
marketing executive : i am participant four i believe .
project manager : and now full screen .
industrial designer : open .
project manager : .
marketing executive : there we go . we have introduced ourselves ,
industrial designer : and then full screen .
marketing executive : so the functional requirements are is part of my goal but why do not we pass right to the second slide . that is where m my discussion starts . right since i am in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since i have to try to sell it .
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason put that there like that is that in the init in the initial stage i should just be open to lots of suggestions . you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should turn on your c_d _ whatever you want it to do and then as we go on what we will have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility . so i will be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it is gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it is gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it is just something we ca not do . so in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in and then just weed things out that ca not be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to a customer we will try to then prioritise those . so that was what i meant there , and as i said on the slide there consulting the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , because if we are gonna sell this thing , the best time to sell it is as a christmas present . twenty five euros makes a little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase , we want somebody to see it and think it is , gee got ta have that . and take out their wallet and buy it . so it is got ta be really attractive and it but it is got ta go to market by september , anything that you do not already have out there in september showing it around , is not gonna sell for christmas . and then i will be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of the features and of the look and the colour and i will be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view . so i will be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you ,
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : and i will be coming to you to tell me what is gonna make somebody take out their wallet ,
user interface designer : what features .
marketing executive : what is gonna really be what they call a sizzle ,
user interface designer : s sellable .
marketing executive : we got ta sell this sizzle . a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view is not the thing that somebody is really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever . can we go to the next slide ? alright i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we are looking at the whole house idea really is not gonna be possible . so i would like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we could suggest anything . i would like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we will have a list of things we can cross off , not something like whole house control what will be and then i found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . at the budget that we are looking at and at the price point we are looking at , we should be able to make it work the t_v _ , the v_c_r _ , the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp .
project manager : can i at this point interject something ?
marketing executive : i have to wind up ?
project manager : we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered . the one thing something to eliminate maybe that is the teletext , because that is outdated with the internet , and according to higher management the it should only control the t_v _ , mostly because they feel that it is too comp complex a task to include other things ,
industrial designer : complicated , .
project manager : and they are concerned with the time to market . and the
marketing executive : so that is something
project manager : and the third thing that they wanna make that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , so that it is easy that they can be easily identified as a product of the company , and that there is no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out . so wanted to interject this here so we are not getting too much off track here with the things we wanna look at . these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate these things , so it is only gonna be t_v _ ,
marketing executive : so
project manager : but the one thing maybe that could be eliminated is the teletext idea .
marketing executive : alright , for that . alright now other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it is lost somewhere in the room . so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address , we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as maybe a beep , and that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate . , so , my personal preferences in this project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . that is the selling point , the thing that is gonna make it an impulse purchase . because once there is no be - back , in sales they always say , be - backs do not come back . if somebody says , i will come back and get it next week you are dead . they are never gonna come back and buy it . you have got ta make it attractive enough so they buy it now w now is a big word in my book for selling this thing . and , in order to make it really sellable we have got ta shorten the learning curve , make it is really intuitive and easy to use . we have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that is why i am saying , simplicity is good . finding it is important , you ca not use it if you ca not find it . so we have got ta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and i have already said this several times but i put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros . so it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , twenty five euros i am not gonna take that . has to be so great that they are gonna say , twenty five euros is not much . and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . that is about it for me right now .
project manager : and who would be next , i that would be you . you want me to get your slide show up ? and you are number three ?
industrial designer : number two ,
project manager : number two .
industrial designer : exactly . can you make it full screen ? no , it is like a you have to press here . the cup shape here ? the thir third .
project manager : there ,  .
industrial designer : so today i am going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . can you go to the next sli slide ? the metal is like in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . it takes the power from a battery say a battery it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to like switch connec connect your remote controller to power supply from the electricity like that . it should be a battery because remote controller should be like you should take it t to wherever you want and then th
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it is like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a t_v _ or a air conditioner , something like that so . a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like th the remote controller it sends some bits some waves like with a particular frequency the device should the frequency is . it should re recognise the waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel like that then the remote controller will send a se send a signal ,
marketing executive : signal .
industrial designer : and the t_v _ it should translate that into like change the channel like that , change the volume control
user interface designer : receive .
industrial designer : and so it is hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices .
user interface designer : multi - purpose .
project manager : yo and it is
marketing executive : that is already been eliminated by management , so we are off the hook .
project manager : but it is so .
industrial designer : so user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user in interface like switch pad like that buttons should be there . so you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you want to mute the t_v _ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there is a there should be some device to tell what to do to the in integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and t_v _ can perform the actions . so can you go to the next slide ? so would like to add some extra features to the remote controller these are the very simple features and they do not take much of the investment also , it is like el the text or buttons which are there on the remote controller they those we can make like fluorescent they will be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark . and ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it is this is not a action , there can be no action taking to that so . and there should be a child lock , like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they ca not be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they will be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . if make it useable for more than one device it is a it is hard but it is possible
project manager : that has been e that has been eliminated , so that is unfortunately a moot point now .
industrial designer : but it
marketing executive : we already eliminated that .
industrial designer : yeah
user interface designer : eliminated .
industrial designer : so it is , . and different shapes that we can do like we can have a all animals shapes or comfortable whi which can fit into your hands and so that
marketing executive : now that is good from a marketing point of view , the fun shape .
industrial designer : and colours also , different colours , and
project manager : i
user interface designer :  colours .
marketing executive : and that you say that wo not add too much to the budget ?
industrial designer : no no , it wo not i do not think it will be like ,
marketing executive : to d the shape is
industrial designer : you can have for if you want ther there to be more
project manager : it just build a mould and .
user interface designer : yes exactly .
industrial designer : it is it is just a s shape so it does not matter .
project manager : as the budget we are looking at if you build one mould i do not think that is going to make a big difference whether it is gonna be square or
marketing executive : do you think there is any chance of having ser in having the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ?
industrial designer : that is also possible i .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : is that gonna be a possible ? that might help with the marketing .
project manager : we will have to look at the budget on that
industrial designer : that will be
project manager : but in principle that would be fun , .
marketing executive : because we had something sexy for adults and we could have something
project manager : silly for children .
industrial designer : for children , exactly .
marketing executive : silly for children
project manager : like an animal or
marketing executive : or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is .
user interface designer : like a doll , or
industrial designer : that is what , . and and the butto buttons also if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated . if you have less features then your remote controller wo not be attractive , so we need to make some buttons which are like f in intended for two or three operations , like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but it will complicate the matter more so .
marketing executive : i think that is something that we will have to discuss with the user interface person
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : because there is a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . because one of the things were complaining about in my what i found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one . the changing modes was something
industrial designer : it is like .
marketing executive : you and i , all f all four of us we work with computers all the time , changing modes is nothing for us , but people who
project manager : a little elderly , a little arthritic hand ,
marketing executive : n and
project manager : and it is a small button and it they do not press it exactly something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : and they are very frustrated .
user interface designer : something else .
marketing executive : and that is and that is the thing people learn by feel , and you do not feel the mode change .
industrial designer : you do not us , usually .
marketing executive : so maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too .
industrial designer : shapes also , different shapes .
marketing executive : like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can develop a tactile sense of it .
industrial designer : that will
user interface designer : channels .
marketing executive : but we will get to that with you .
industrial designer : and also text should be very clear so that there wo not be any ambiguities and
marketing executive : . now that is a good point .
industrial designer : so . and display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it i do not think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it is
marketing executive : that is a good one ,
project manager :  ,  .
industrial designer : and we display a clock .
marketing executive : because the clock would be really friendly ,
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : and when is your favourite show coming on
industrial designer : and then you can just see your remote controller so
project manager : you are sitting there already or maybe you have no other
marketing executive : and , and a lot of time there is not a clock on the screen , and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute . that is good , the clock is good .
industrial designer : can you go to the next slide ? components the main components we need for it ha like buttons and underneath that there should be switch . like we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the t_v _ is on suppose , then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light . then it will be like if you switch on your t_v _ through anoth another source , not from through a remote controller and you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light . maybe we can have that . whenever the t_v _ is on , remote controller will have a light . and then infrared bulbs . this is like when it is dark . and battery , there should be a battery for power supply , and a chip , chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations , and wires connecting all chips , which is lights , everything , so there should be wires . and there should be a case where we can keep all the things and , different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape .
user interface designer : to keep the remote ?
marketing executive : case .
user interface designer : a case holder . a holder remote holder .
industrial designer : holder .
project manager : holder ,  .
industrial designer : can you move onto the next slide . next sli slide . i have referred the site the homepage of the our website , from where i have i got s few points . that is it , that is it from me now .
marketing executive : so it we should visit this site and have a look at what is up there ? or
project manager : you do not have to .
industrial designer : it is not like that , i have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so .
marketing executive : . so it might be helpful if we had a look at that .
industrial designer : if you want .
marketing executive : could you go back to that slide where she had that s slide up betsy ?
industrial designer : it is actually there now , there on the screen .
project manager : this one ?
marketing executive :
project manager : and francine ?
user interface designer : participant two .
project manager : you are number two ?
user interface designer : no no , i am three .
project manager : you are three . would you want it full screen ?
user interface designer : make it full ?
project manager :  ?
user interface designer : as user interface designer i did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote . can you go onto the next slide ? so i found out that but the main purpose of a remote is to f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance . now for that , a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the t_v _ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the t_v _ . there should be a signal something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a led which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume he can change it . now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular programme or switching on and off a particular programme according to the user choice .
project manager : on the on the remote .
user interface designer : yes . so if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the t_v _ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time .
project manager : right .
user interface designer : so he can use that properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children can not view that channel .
project manager : by your child ,  .
user interface designer : and the and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote . t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t_v _ television . and as this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t _ in alphabet for more compactability . and and it is one more point which i noted it down , like the material which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not any skin disease some al allergy to either children or to ad adult person . and it should have an it can have an alarm clock a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight p_m _ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock , and i do not think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote .
industrial designer : if there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock .
user interface designer : yes ,
marketing executive : and an alarm clock , that should be .
user interface designer : and as john reece said the buttons can be , can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different buttons will glow differently . so in even in the dark the user can buttons to use to switch on a particular channel . and the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote , he should not be harmed in any way . and findings , i found out y on different sites that there are different remotes which can be used , there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities , there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are so there you have different types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television . and these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use . not , no like it can be used as a t_v _ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock , and then to save electricity there should not be much s move lots of circuits and all that . and if a person if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it .
industrial designer : it is like a t , it is like a timer it is like a lock to the television .
project manager : timer ,  .
user interface designer : timer . and then you can use a timer as .
project manager : now i have on my slide show we already we have already done the agenda , and on the closing there will be lunch break and all that . however the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group . and what function , working design , how does it work . so these are the two things we should come up wit with . so the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on who is our target group . i in many ways everybody . everybody who has a t_v _ .
industrial designer : t_v _ , .
user interface designer : t_v _ television we was .
project manager : and today there are probably not many people who do not have a t_v _ .
industrial designer : do not t_v _ , .
project manager : there are a few but in general not . now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but within the target group we have subgroups . we have we have earlier it was mentioned about elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : so that is one group that is certainly important . then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it is really very clear . and i how much we want to cater to children is use . that is a question whether that is important that children can really use it or not . so this these are just some thoughts i have on it , and what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we are gonna design this one thing or whether we are looking at what we like we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups .
marketing executive : there is the old motto , children under six never shop alone . so if you have designed something that is very attractive to children the mummy we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing pull .
project manager : that has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but i am talking about the functionality now on it whether we are looking at different groups . the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours . , like you make it and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever
user interface designer : different colours .
marketing executive : you can make a banana shaped one .
project manager : but the question is really , who is our target group . do we look at one target group ? and with the twenty five euros can we afford to have i am asking the technical people here whether to look at subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect ?
marketing executive : respect .
user interface designer : no generally we can design a remote which is mainly for people with f age from ten to forty and then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes .
project manager : with with
industrial designer : we can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and .
project manager : that is
user interface designer : but in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they can not buy three different remotes .
industrial designer : children and everybody , .
user interface designer : they would like to buy just one and just one which can be used all the three
industrial designer : that we can do , but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you ca not really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different .
marketing executive : what about the electronics ? that is not really gonna change much , is it ?
user interface designer : cost effective .
industrial designer : no , it does not cost , .
project manager : no
marketing executive : that that w that wo not change much , will it ?
industrial designer : . does not does not matter .
project manager : the the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function ,
marketing executive : i d i would not .
project manager : and the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons , within the target group or subgroups . the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . the basic design i understand will be the same , but the question is how much will that set us back if let is say forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons . so that remains to s to be seen but the target group as a whole is everybody with a t_v _ .
marketing executive : and can we is it even feasible to make one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ?
project manager : that is the question .
marketing executive : the same electronics and all that is gonna be different is the plastic case . and in that case we could probabl moulded plastic is not all that expensive is it ?
industrial designer : no . , i do not think no .
marketing executive : you as an industrial person ?
project manager : maybe there is an idea t the new portable phones ? they have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever , and maybe something like that , that in each package you have you have let is say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package .
marketing executive : there is a real idea .
project manager : and then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately .
industrial designer : like for mobile phones we have different covers , like designs and all so that w we can have that .
marketing executive : right .
project manager : but like if then everybody is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package , then they can go to the store and for a few francs or euros whatever they can buy
marketing executive : an alternate package .
project manager : an alternate package with another two colours in it .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : but i have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people .
project manager : i think the idea here is to d design one remote
industrial designer : but
marketing executive : we can only aff ,
project manager : and what the only change is gonna be the funct d t
marketing executive : cosmetic .
user interface designer : of th .
project manager : the functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way , having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children five minutes that was i tha that is the old message .
marketing executive : warning , finish meeting now .
project manager : finish meeting now .
marketing executive : we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but
industrial designer : maybe , .
project manager : but
industrial designer : if we do some more research , maybe we .
project manager : to sum it up the target group is everybody . if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : do we agree , do we ?
industrial designer : maybe seventy percent is a unique remote controller and thirty percent is it is like .
marketing executive : but we have to l
project manager : do we agree on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not .
industrial designer : , .
marketing executive : fair enough .
project manager : ? so now i understand it is lunch break . so that is what we will do . so hank you very much . and we will see you after lunch .","the meeting begins and the marketing expert starts her presentation promptly , telling them that her research shows they need a focus- it is not possible to make a device that works on the whole house . the project manager steps in and informs them that they have instructions to eliminate the teletext idea because it is too complicated , and also said they must maintain the corporate image by using corporate designs and colors . the marketing expert resumes , talking about how remotes often get lost and that a light emitter might be useful . the industrial designer gives her presentation , talking about components , materials , and energy sources . they discuss giving the control different shapes to suit both adults and children , making the buttons various shapes , and putting a display clock on the control . the interface designer presents , talking about the features users like on a remote and suggesting that they make the remote a t-shape and add an alarm clock function . they discuss their target group and the possibility of removable plastic cases . they close the meeting deciding to do more research on the plastic cases . they cannot make a device that works on the whole house- will need a focus . they will eliminate teletext . they will maintain the corporate image by using the proper designs and colors . their target group is basically everybody who owns a tv . they are concerned about making the control marketable to a wide range of age groups , and have discussed making removable plastic covers so that the look is changeable . however , they need to do more research on this topic . they do not know if their budget will allow them to include all the features they would like to such as a light emitter , clock , alarm clock , and child lock .
","the project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda . the marketing expert gives her presentation about her role as the interface specialist and explains that she is primarily interested in finding out what functions and features a user would like to see in a personal digital assistant device . she also discusses the timing of a user's purchase and the budget constraints involved in producing such a device . the industrial designer presents , explaining the basic function of an interface device and how it works . he lists the main functions of an interface device such as on/off , volume , keys , and buttons . the group then discusses what functions and features to include in order to create a desirable interface device . the project manager closes the meeting . the interface specialist will work on the functional requirements of the device . the marketing expert will work on what functions and features a user would like to see in a personal digital assistant device . the industrial designer will work on the look and feel of the device . the project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what his/her role will be in the project . the marketing expert will work on finding out what functions and features a user would like to see in a personal digital assistant device . the industrial designer will work on the look and feel of the device . the group will discuss what functions and features to include in order to create a desirable interface device . the marketing expert will work on",x,,x,,,,,,7.0,Pegasus-Cons
118,"project manager : is everybody ready ?
industrial designer : ?
marketing executive : i would to just put on my microphone here and i will be right with you .
project manager :  .
marketing executive : ?
project manager : i take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do
user interface designer : yes .
project manager : and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires .
marketing executive : you want me to start right now ?
project manager :  .
marketing executive : could you put my slides up it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time .
project manager : you are participant four .
marketing executive : i am participant four i believe .
project manager : and now full screen .
industrial designer : open .
project manager : .
marketing executive : there we go . we have introduced ourselves ,
industrial designer : and then full screen .
marketing executive : so the functional requirements are is part of my goal but why do not we pass right to the second slide . that is where m my discussion starts . right since i am in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since i have to try to sell it .
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason put that there like that is that in the init in the initial stage i should just be open to lots of suggestions . you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should turn on your c_d _ whatever you want it to do and then as we go on what we will have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility . so i will be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it is gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it is gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it is just something we ca not do . so in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in and then just weed things out that ca not be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to a customer we will try to then prioritise those . so that was what i meant there , and as i said on the slide there consulting the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , because if we are gonna sell this thing , the best time to sell it is as a christmas present . twenty five euros makes a little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase , we want somebody to see it and think it is , gee got ta have that . and take out their wallet and buy it . so it is got ta be really attractive and it but it is got ta go to market by september , anything that you do not already have out there in september showing it around , is not gonna sell for christmas . and then i will be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of the features and of the look and the colour and i will be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view . so i will be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you ,
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : and i will be coming to you to tell me what is gonna make somebody take out their wallet ,
user interface designer : what features .
marketing executive : what is gonna really be what they call a sizzle ,
user interface designer : s sellable .
marketing executive : we got ta sell this sizzle . a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view is not the thing that somebody is really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever . can we go to the next slide ? alright i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we are looking at the whole house idea really is not gonna be possible . so i would like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we could suggest anything . i would like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we will have a list of things we can cross off , not something like whole house control what will be and then i found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . at the budget that we are looking at and at the price point we are looking at , we should be able to make it work the t_v _ , the v_c_r _ , the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp .
project manager : can i at this point interject something ?
marketing executive : i have to wind up ?
project manager : we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered . the one thing something to eliminate maybe that is the teletext , because that is outdated with the internet , and according to higher management the it should only control the t_v _ , mostly because they feel that it is too comp complex a task to include other things ,
industrial designer : complicated , .
project manager : and they are concerned with the time to market . and the
marketing executive : so that is something
project manager : and the third thing that they wanna make that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , so that it is easy that they can be easily identified as a product of the company , and that there is no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out . so wanted to interject this here so we are not getting too much off track here with the things we wanna look at . these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate these things , so it is only gonna be t_v _ ,
marketing executive : so
project manager : but the one thing maybe that could be eliminated is the teletext idea .
marketing executive : alright , for that . alright now other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it is lost somewhere in the room . so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address , we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as maybe a beep , and that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate . , so , my personal preferences in this project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . that is the selling point , the thing that is gonna make it an impulse purchase . because once there is no be - back , in sales they always say , be - backs do not come back . if somebody says , i will come back and get it next week you are dead . they are never gonna come back and buy it . you have got ta make it attractive enough so they buy it now w now is a big word in my book for selling this thing . and , in order to make it really sellable we have got ta shorten the learning curve , make it is really intuitive and easy to use . we have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that is why i am saying , simplicity is good . finding it is important , you ca not use it if you ca not find it . so we have got ta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and i have already said this several times but i put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros . so it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , twenty five euros i am not gonna take that . has to be so great that they are gonna say , twenty five euros is not much . and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . that is about it for me right now .
project manager : and who would be next , i that would be you . you want me to get your slide show up ? and you are number three ?
industrial designer : number two ,
project manager : number two .
industrial designer : exactly . can you make it full screen ? no , it is like a you have to press here . the cup shape here ? the thir third .
project manager : there ,  .
industrial designer : so today i am going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . can you go to the next sli slide ? the metal is like in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . it takes the power from a battery say a battery it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to like switch connec connect your remote controller to power supply from the electricity like that . it should be a battery because remote controller should be like you should take it t to wherever you want and then th
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it is like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a t_v _ or a air conditioner , something like that so . a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like th the remote controller it sends some bits some waves like with a particular frequency the device should the frequency is . it should re recognise the waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel like that then the remote controller will send a se send a signal ,
marketing executive : signal .
industrial designer : and the t_v _ it should translate that into like change the channel like that , change the volume control
user interface designer : receive .
industrial designer : and so it is hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices .
user interface designer : multi - purpose .
project manager : yo and it is
marketing executive : that is already been eliminated by management , so we are off the hook .
project manager : but it is so .
industrial designer : so user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user in interface like switch pad like that buttons should be there . so you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you want to mute the t_v _ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there is a there should be some device to tell what to do to the in integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and t_v _ can perform the actions . so can you go to the next slide ? so would like to add some extra features to the remote controller these are the very simple features and they do not take much of the investment also , it is like el the text or buttons which are there on the remote controller they those we can make like fluorescent they will be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark . and ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it is this is not a action , there can be no action taking to that so . and there should be a child lock , like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they ca not be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they will be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . if make it useable for more than one device it is a it is hard but it is possible
project manager : that has been e that has been eliminated , so that is unfortunately a moot point now .
industrial designer : but it
marketing executive : we already eliminated that .
industrial designer : yeah
user interface designer : eliminated .
industrial designer : so it is , . and different shapes that we can do like we can have a all animals shapes or comfortable whi which can fit into your hands and so that
marketing executive : now that is good from a marketing point of view , the fun shape .
industrial designer : and colours also , different colours , and
project manager : i
user interface designer :  colours .
marketing executive : and that you say that wo not add too much to the budget ?
industrial designer : no no , it wo not i do not think it will be like ,
marketing executive : to d the shape is
industrial designer : you can have for if you want ther there to be more
project manager : it just build a mould and .
user interface designer : yes exactly .
industrial designer : it is it is just a s shape so it does not matter .
project manager : as the budget we are looking at if you build one mould i do not think that is going to make a big difference whether it is gonna be square or
marketing executive : do you think there is any chance of having ser in having the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ?
industrial designer : that is also possible i .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : is that gonna be a possible ? that might help with the marketing .
project manager : we will have to look at the budget on that
industrial designer : that will be
project manager : but in principle that would be fun , .
marketing executive : because we had something sexy for adults and we could have something
project manager : silly for children .
industrial designer : for children , exactly .
marketing executive : silly for children
project manager : like an animal or
marketing executive : or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is .
user interface designer : like a doll , or
industrial designer : that is what , . and and the butto buttons also if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated . if you have less features then your remote controller wo not be attractive , so we need to make some buttons which are like f in intended for two or three operations , like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but it will complicate the matter more so .
marketing executive : i think that is something that we will have to discuss with the user interface person
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : because there is a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . because one of the things were complaining about in my what i found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one . the changing modes was something
industrial designer : it is like .
marketing executive : you and i , all f all four of us we work with computers all the time , changing modes is nothing for us , but people who
project manager : a little elderly , a little arthritic hand ,
marketing executive : n and
project manager : and it is a small button and it they do not press it exactly something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : and they are very frustrated .
user interface designer : something else .
marketing executive : and that is and that is the thing people learn by feel , and you do not feel the mode change .
industrial designer : you do not us , usually .
marketing executive : so maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too .
industrial designer : shapes also , different shapes .
marketing executive : like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can develop a tactile sense of it .
industrial designer : that will
user interface designer : channels .
marketing executive : but we will get to that with you .
industrial designer : and also text should be very clear so that there wo not be any ambiguities and
marketing executive : . now that is a good point .
industrial designer : so . and display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it i do not think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it is
marketing executive : that is a good one ,
project manager :  ,  .
industrial designer : and we display a clock .
marketing executive : because the clock would be really friendly ,
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : and when is your favourite show coming on
industrial designer : and then you can just see your remote controller so
project manager : you are sitting there already or maybe you have no other
marketing executive : and , and a lot of time there is not a clock on the screen , and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute . that is good , the clock is good .
industrial designer : can you go to the next slide ? components the main components we need for it ha like buttons and underneath that there should be switch . like we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the t_v _ is on suppose , then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light . then it will be like if you switch on your t_v _ through anoth another source , not from through a remote controller and you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light . maybe we can have that . whenever the t_v _ is on , remote controller will have a light . and then infrared bulbs . this is like when it is dark . and battery , there should be a battery for power supply , and a chip , chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations , and wires connecting all chips , which is lights , everything , so there should be wires . and there should be a case where we can keep all the things and , different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape .
user interface designer : to keep the remote ?
marketing executive : case .
user interface designer : a case holder . a holder remote holder .
industrial designer : holder .
project manager : holder ,  .
industrial designer : can you move onto the next slide . next sli slide . i have referred the site the homepage of the our website , from where i have i got s few points . that is it , that is it from me now .
marketing executive : so it we should visit this site and have a look at what is up there ? or
project manager : you do not have to .
industrial designer : it is not like that , i have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so .
marketing executive : . so it might be helpful if we had a look at that .
industrial designer : if you want .
marketing executive : could you go back to that slide where she had that s slide up betsy ?
industrial designer : it is actually there now , there on the screen .
project manager : this one ?
marketing executive :
project manager : and francine ?
user interface designer : participant two .
project manager : you are number two ?
user interface designer : no no , i am three .
project manager : you are three . would you want it full screen ?
user interface designer : make it full ?
project manager :  ?
user interface designer : as user interface designer i did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote . can you go onto the next slide ? so i found out that but the main purpose of a remote is to f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance . now for that , a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the t_v _ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the t_v _ . there should be a signal something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a led which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume he can change it . now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular programme or switching on and off a particular programme according to the user choice .
project manager : on the on the remote .
user interface designer : yes . so if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the t_v _ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time .
project manager : right .
user interface designer : so he can use that properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children can not view that channel .
project manager : by your child ,  .
user interface designer : and the and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote . t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t_v _ television . and as this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t _ in alphabet for more compactability . and and it is one more point which i noted it down , like the material which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not any skin disease some al allergy to either children or to ad adult person . and it should have an it can have an alarm clock a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight p_m _ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock , and i do not think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote .
industrial designer : if there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock .
user interface designer : yes ,
marketing executive : and an alarm clock , that should be .
user interface designer : and as john reece said the buttons can be , can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different buttons will glow differently . so in even in the dark the user can buttons to use to switch on a particular channel . and the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote , he should not be harmed in any way . and findings , i found out y on different sites that there are different remotes which can be used , there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities , there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are so there you have different types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television . and these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use . not , no like it can be used as a t_v _ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock , and then to save electricity there should not be much s move lots of circuits and all that . and if a person if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it .
industrial designer : it is like a t , it is like a timer it is like a lock to the television .
project manager : timer ,  .
user interface designer : timer . and then you can use a timer as .
project manager : now i have on my slide show we already we have already done the agenda , and on the closing there will be lunch break and all that . however the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group . and what function , working design , how does it work . so these are the two things we should come up wit with . so the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on who is our target group . i in many ways everybody . everybody who has a t_v _ .
industrial designer : t_v _ , .
user interface designer : t_v _ television we was .
project manager : and today there are probably not many people who do not have a t_v _ .
industrial designer : do not t_v _ , .
project manager : there are a few but in general not . now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but within the target group we have subgroups . we have we have earlier it was mentioned about elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : so that is one group that is certainly important . then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it is really very clear . and i how much we want to cater to children is use . that is a question whether that is important that children can really use it or not . so this these are just some thoughts i have on it , and what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we are gonna design this one thing or whether we are looking at what we like we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups .
marketing executive : there is the old motto , children under six never shop alone . so if you have designed something that is very attractive to children the mummy we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing pull .
project manager : that has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but i am talking about the functionality now on it whether we are looking at different groups . the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours . , like you make it and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever
user interface designer : different colours .
marketing executive : you can make a banana shaped one .
project manager : but the question is really , who is our target group . do we look at one target group ? and with the twenty five euros can we afford to have i am asking the technical people here whether to look at subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect ?
marketing executive : respect .
user interface designer : no generally we can design a remote which is mainly for people with f age from ten to forty and then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes .
project manager : with with
industrial designer : we can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and .
project manager : that is
user interface designer : but in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they can not buy three different remotes .
industrial designer : children and everybody , .
user interface designer : they would like to buy just one and just one which can be used all the three
industrial designer : that we can do , but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you ca not really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different .
marketing executive : what about the electronics ? that is not really gonna change much , is it ?
user interface designer : cost effective .
industrial designer : no , it does not cost , .
project manager : no
marketing executive : that that w that wo not change much , will it ?
industrial designer : . does not does not matter .
project manager : the the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function ,
marketing executive : i d i would not .
project manager : and the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons , within the target group or subgroups . the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . the basic design i understand will be the same , but the question is how much will that set us back if let is say forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons . so that remains to s to be seen but the target group as a whole is everybody with a t_v _ .
marketing executive : and can we is it even feasible to make one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ?
project manager : that is the question .
marketing executive : the same electronics and all that is gonna be different is the plastic case . and in that case we could probabl moulded plastic is not all that expensive is it ?
industrial designer : no . , i do not think no .
marketing executive : you as an industrial person ?
project manager : maybe there is an idea t the new portable phones ? they have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever , and maybe something like that , that in each package you have you have let is say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package .
marketing executive : there is a real idea .
project manager : and then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately .
industrial designer : like for mobile phones we have different covers , like designs and all so that w we can have that .
marketing executive : right .
project manager : but like if then everybody is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package , then they can go to the store and for a few francs or euros whatever they can buy
marketing executive : an alternate package .
project manager : an alternate package with another two colours in it .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : but i have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people .
project manager : i think the idea here is to d design one remote
industrial designer : but
marketing executive : we can only aff ,
project manager : and what the only change is gonna be the funct d t
marketing executive : cosmetic .
user interface designer : of th .
project manager : the functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way , having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children five minutes that was i tha that is the old message .
marketing executive : warning , finish meeting now .
project manager : finish meeting now .
marketing executive : we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but
industrial designer : maybe , .
project manager : but
industrial designer : if we do some more research , maybe we .
project manager : to sum it up the target group is everybody . if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : do we agree , do we ?
industrial designer : maybe seventy percent is a unique remote controller and thirty percent is it is like .
marketing executive : but we have to l
project manager : do we agree on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not .
industrial designer : , .
marketing executive : fair enough .
project manager : ? so now i understand it is lunch break . so that is what we will do . so hank you very much . and we will see you after lunch .","the meeting begins and the marketing expert starts her presentation promptly , telling them that her research shows they need a focus- it is not possible to make a device that works on the whole house . the project manager steps in and informs them that they have instructions to eliminate the teletext idea because it is too complicated , and also said they must maintain the corporate image by using corporate designs and colors . the marketing expert resumes , talking about how remotes often get lost and that a light emitter might be useful . the industrial designer gives her presentation , talking about components , materials , and energy sources . they discuss giving the control different shapes to suit both adults and children , making the buttons various shapes , and putting a display clock on the control . the interface designer presents , talking about the features users like on a remote and suggesting that they make the remote a t-shape and add an alarm clock function . they discuss their target group and the possibility of removable plastic cases . they close the meeting deciding to do more research on the plastic cases . they cannot make a device that works on the whole house- will need a focus . they will eliminate teletext . they will maintain the corporate image by using the proper designs and colors . their target group is basically everybody who owns a tv . they are concerned about making the control marketable to a wide range of age groups , and have discussed making removable plastic covers so that the look is changeable . however , they need to do more research on this topic . they do not know if their budget will allow them to include all the features they would like to such as a light emitter , clock , alarm clock , and child lock .
","the marketing expert presented the product requirements to the group . he discussed how to create a product that is attractive , functional , and affordable . the industrial designer discussed the possible components and how to make a case for the device so it can be used as a stand . she discussed the cost and time involved in constructing the device ; the project manager discussed the projected budget and the group decided on several different options based on their initial ideas of what they wanted to do and the available products on the market . they discussed the attractiveness of the device and the need for special functions that would require a special shape or color to make the device stand out of its ability to be a spongy . when it became apparent that the group had difficulties in meeting the management's directives and led them in deciding on what could be done in order to keep the project within the budget . all participants were instructed to work on their individual tasks and then instructed to prepare a final report at the end of the meeting . after the group discussed deciding what functions and materials to include . it was decided that the device would come in a specially designed and will not include a locator function . there will be no longer be room for decoration , since it will be only one color and not be able to have a conversation about what functions would be included .",x,,x,,,,,,5.0,T5-Cons
119,"project manager : is everybody ready ?
industrial designer : ?
marketing executive : i would to just put on my microphone here and i will be right with you .
project manager :  .
marketing executive : ?
project manager : i take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do
user interface designer : yes .
project manager : and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires .
marketing executive : you want me to start right now ?
project manager :  .
marketing executive : could you put my slides up it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time .
project manager : you are participant four .
marketing executive : i am participant four i believe .
project manager : and now full screen .
industrial designer : open .
project manager : .
marketing executive : there we go . we have introduced ourselves ,
industrial designer : and then full screen .
marketing executive : so the functional requirements are is part of my goal but why do not we pass right to the second slide . that is where m my discussion starts . right since i am in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since i have to try to sell it .
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason put that there like that is that in the init in the initial stage i should just be open to lots of suggestions . you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should turn on your c_d _ whatever you want it to do and then as we go on what we will have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility . so i will be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it is gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it is gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it is just something we ca not do . so in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in and then just weed things out that ca not be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to a customer we will try to then prioritise those . so that was what i meant there , and as i said on the slide there consulting the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , because if we are gonna sell this thing , the best time to sell it is as a christmas present . twenty five euros makes a little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase , we want somebody to see it and think it is , gee got ta have that . and take out their wallet and buy it . so it is got ta be really attractive and it but it is got ta go to market by september , anything that you do not already have out there in september showing it around , is not gonna sell for christmas . and then i will be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of the features and of the look and the colour and i will be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view . so i will be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you ,
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : and i will be coming to you to tell me what is gonna make somebody take out their wallet ,
user interface designer : what features .
marketing executive : what is gonna really be what they call a sizzle ,
user interface designer : s sellable .
marketing executive : we got ta sell this sizzle . a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view is not the thing that somebody is really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever . can we go to the next slide ? alright i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we are looking at the whole house idea really is not gonna be possible . so i would like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we could suggest anything . i would like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we will have a list of things we can cross off , not something like whole house control what will be and then i found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . at the budget that we are looking at and at the price point we are looking at , we should be able to make it work the t_v _ , the v_c_r _ , the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp .
project manager : can i at this point interject something ?
marketing executive : i have to wind up ?
project manager : we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered . the one thing something to eliminate maybe that is the teletext , because that is outdated with the internet , and according to higher management the it should only control the t_v _ , mostly because they feel that it is too comp complex a task to include other things ,
industrial designer : complicated , .
project manager : and they are concerned with the time to market . and the
marketing executive : so that is something
project manager : and the third thing that they wanna make that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , so that it is easy that they can be easily identified as a product of the company , and that there is no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out . so wanted to interject this here so we are not getting too much off track here with the things we wanna look at . these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate these things , so it is only gonna be t_v _ ,
marketing executive : so
project manager : but the one thing maybe that could be eliminated is the teletext idea .
marketing executive : alright , for that . alright now other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it is lost somewhere in the room . so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address , we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as maybe a beep , and that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate . , so , my personal preferences in this project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . that is the selling point , the thing that is gonna make it an impulse purchase . because once there is no be - back , in sales they always say , be - backs do not come back . if somebody says , i will come back and get it next week you are dead . they are never gonna come back and buy it . you have got ta make it attractive enough so they buy it now w now is a big word in my book for selling this thing . and , in order to make it really sellable we have got ta shorten the learning curve , make it is really intuitive and easy to use . we have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that is why i am saying , simplicity is good . finding it is important , you ca not use it if you ca not find it . so we have got ta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and i have already said this several times but i put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros . so it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , twenty five euros i am not gonna take that . has to be so great that they are gonna say , twenty five euros is not much . and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . that is about it for me right now .
project manager : and who would be next , i that would be you . you want me to get your slide show up ? and you are number three ?
industrial designer : number two ,
project manager : number two .
industrial designer : exactly . can you make it full screen ? no , it is like a you have to press here . the cup shape here ? the thir third .
project manager : there ,  .
industrial designer : so today i am going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . can you go to the next sli slide ? the metal is like in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . it takes the power from a battery say a battery it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to like switch connec connect your remote controller to power supply from the electricity like that . it should be a battery because remote controller should be like you should take it t to wherever you want and then th
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it is like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a t_v _ or a air conditioner , something like that so . a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like th the remote controller it sends some bits some waves like with a particular frequency the device should the frequency is . it should re recognise the waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel like that then the remote controller will send a se send a signal ,
marketing executive : signal .
industrial designer : and the t_v _ it should translate that into like change the channel like that , change the volume control
user interface designer : receive .
industrial designer : and so it is hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices .
user interface designer : multi - purpose .
project manager : yo and it is
marketing executive : that is already been eliminated by management , so we are off the hook .
project manager : but it is so .
industrial designer : so user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user in interface like switch pad like that buttons should be there . so you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you want to mute the t_v _ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there is a there should be some device to tell what to do to the in integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and t_v _ can perform the actions . so can you go to the next slide ? so would like to add some extra features to the remote controller these are the very simple features and they do not take much of the investment also , it is like el the text or buttons which are there on the remote controller they those we can make like fluorescent they will be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark . and ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it is this is not a action , there can be no action taking to that so . and there should be a child lock , like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they ca not be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they will be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . if make it useable for more than one device it is a it is hard but it is possible
project manager : that has been e that has been eliminated , so that is unfortunately a moot point now .
industrial designer : but it
marketing executive : we already eliminated that .
industrial designer : yeah
user interface designer : eliminated .
industrial designer : so it is , . and different shapes that we can do like we can have a all animals shapes or comfortable whi which can fit into your hands and so that
marketing executive : now that is good from a marketing point of view , the fun shape .
industrial designer : and colours also , different colours , and
project manager : i
user interface designer :  colours .
marketing executive : and that you say that wo not add too much to the budget ?
industrial designer : no no , it wo not i do not think it will be like ,
marketing executive : to d the shape is
industrial designer : you can have for if you want ther there to be more
project manager : it just build a mould and .
user interface designer : yes exactly .
industrial designer : it is it is just a s shape so it does not matter .
project manager : as the budget we are looking at if you build one mould i do not think that is going to make a big difference whether it is gonna be square or
marketing executive : do you think there is any chance of having ser in having the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ?
industrial designer : that is also possible i .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : is that gonna be a possible ? that might help with the marketing .
project manager : we will have to look at the budget on that
industrial designer : that will be
project manager : but in principle that would be fun , .
marketing executive : because we had something sexy for adults and we could have something
project manager : silly for children .
industrial designer : for children , exactly .
marketing executive : silly for children
project manager : like an animal or
marketing executive : or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is .
user interface designer : like a doll , or
industrial designer : that is what , . and and the butto buttons also if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated . if you have less features then your remote controller wo not be attractive , so we need to make some buttons which are like f in intended for two or three operations , like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but it will complicate the matter more so .
marketing executive : i think that is something that we will have to discuss with the user interface person
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : because there is a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . because one of the things were complaining about in my what i found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one . the changing modes was something
industrial designer : it is like .
marketing executive : you and i , all f all four of us we work with computers all the time , changing modes is nothing for us , but people who
project manager : a little elderly , a little arthritic hand ,
marketing executive : n and
project manager : and it is a small button and it they do not press it exactly something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : and they are very frustrated .
user interface designer : something else .
marketing executive : and that is and that is the thing people learn by feel , and you do not feel the mode change .
industrial designer : you do not us , usually .
marketing executive : so maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too .
industrial designer : shapes also , different shapes .
marketing executive : like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can develop a tactile sense of it .
industrial designer : that will
user interface designer : channels .
marketing executive : but we will get to that with you .
industrial designer : and also text should be very clear so that there wo not be any ambiguities and
marketing executive : . now that is a good point .
industrial designer : so . and display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it i do not think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it is
marketing executive : that is a good one ,
project manager :  ,  .
industrial designer : and we display a clock .
marketing executive : because the clock would be really friendly ,
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : and when is your favourite show coming on
industrial designer : and then you can just see your remote controller so
project manager : you are sitting there already or maybe you have no other
marketing executive : and , and a lot of time there is not a clock on the screen , and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute . that is good , the clock is good .
industrial designer : can you go to the next slide ? components the main components we need for it ha like buttons and underneath that there should be switch . like we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the t_v _ is on suppose , then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light . then it will be like if you switch on your t_v _ through anoth another source , not from through a remote controller and you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light . maybe we can have that . whenever the t_v _ is on , remote controller will have a light . and then infrared bulbs . this is like when it is dark . and battery , there should be a battery for power supply , and a chip , chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations , and wires connecting all chips , which is lights , everything , so there should be wires . and there should be a case where we can keep all the things and , different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape .
user interface designer : to keep the remote ?
marketing executive : case .
user interface designer : a case holder . a holder remote holder .
industrial designer : holder .
project manager : holder ,  .
industrial designer : can you move onto the next slide . next sli slide . i have referred the site the homepage of the our website , from where i have i got s few points . that is it , that is it from me now .
marketing executive : so it we should visit this site and have a look at what is up there ? or
project manager : you do not have to .
industrial designer : it is not like that , i have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so .
marketing executive : . so it might be helpful if we had a look at that .
industrial designer : if you want .
marketing executive : could you go back to that slide where she had that s slide up betsy ?
industrial designer : it is actually there now , there on the screen .
project manager : this one ?
marketing executive :
project manager : and francine ?
user interface designer : participant two .
project manager : you are number two ?
user interface designer : no no , i am three .
project manager : you are three . would you want it full screen ?
user interface designer : make it full ?
project manager :  ?
user interface designer : as user interface designer i did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote . can you go onto the next slide ? so i found out that but the main purpose of a remote is to f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance . now for that , a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the t_v _ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the t_v _ . there should be a signal something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a led which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume he can change it . now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular programme or switching on and off a particular programme according to the user choice .
project manager : on the on the remote .
user interface designer : yes . so if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the t_v _ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time .
project manager : right .
user interface designer : so he can use that properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children can not view that channel .
project manager : by your child ,  .
user interface designer : and the and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote . t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t_v _ television . and as this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t _ in alphabet for more compactability . and and it is one more point which i noted it down , like the material which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not any skin disease some al allergy to either children or to ad adult person . and it should have an it can have an alarm clock a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight p_m _ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock , and i do not think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote .
industrial designer : if there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock .
user interface designer : yes ,
marketing executive : and an alarm clock , that should be .
user interface designer : and as john reece said the buttons can be , can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different buttons will glow differently . so in even in the dark the user can buttons to use to switch on a particular channel . and the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote , he should not be harmed in any way . and findings , i found out y on different sites that there are different remotes which can be used , there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities , there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are so there you have different types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television . and these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use . not , no like it can be used as a t_v _ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock , and then to save electricity there should not be much s move lots of circuits and all that . and if a person if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it .
industrial designer : it is like a t , it is like a timer it is like a lock to the television .
project manager : timer ,  .
user interface designer : timer . and then you can use a timer as .
project manager : now i have on my slide show we already we have already done the agenda , and on the closing there will be lunch break and all that . however the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group . and what function , working design , how does it work . so these are the two things we should come up wit with . so the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on who is our target group . i in many ways everybody . everybody who has a t_v _ .
industrial designer : t_v _ , .
user interface designer : t_v _ television we was .
project manager : and today there are probably not many people who do not have a t_v _ .
industrial designer : do not t_v _ , .
project manager : there are a few but in general not . now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but within the target group we have subgroups . we have we have earlier it was mentioned about elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : so that is one group that is certainly important . then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it is really very clear . and i how much we want to cater to children is use . that is a question whether that is important that children can really use it or not . so this these are just some thoughts i have on it , and what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we are gonna design this one thing or whether we are looking at what we like we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups .
marketing executive : there is the old motto , children under six never shop alone . so if you have designed something that is very attractive to children the mummy we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing pull .
project manager : that has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but i am talking about the functionality now on it whether we are looking at different groups . the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours . , like you make it and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever
user interface designer : different colours .
marketing executive : you can make a banana shaped one .
project manager : but the question is really , who is our target group . do we look at one target group ? and with the twenty five euros can we afford to have i am asking the technical people here whether to look at subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect ?
marketing executive : respect .
user interface designer : no generally we can design a remote which is mainly for people with f age from ten to forty and then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes .
project manager : with with
industrial designer : we can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and .
project manager : that is
user interface designer : but in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they can not buy three different remotes .
industrial designer : children and everybody , .
user interface designer : they would like to buy just one and just one which can be used all the three
industrial designer : that we can do , but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you ca not really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different .
marketing executive : what about the electronics ? that is not really gonna change much , is it ?
user interface designer : cost effective .
industrial designer : no , it does not cost , .
project manager : no
marketing executive : that that w that wo not change much , will it ?
industrial designer : . does not does not matter .
project manager : the the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function ,
marketing executive : i d i would not .
project manager : and the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons , within the target group or subgroups . the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . the basic design i understand will be the same , but the question is how much will that set us back if let is say forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons . so that remains to s to be seen but the target group as a whole is everybody with a t_v _ .
marketing executive : and can we is it even feasible to make one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ?
project manager : that is the question .
marketing executive : the same electronics and all that is gonna be different is the plastic case . and in that case we could probabl moulded plastic is not all that expensive is it ?
industrial designer : no . , i do not think no .
marketing executive : you as an industrial person ?
project manager : maybe there is an idea t the new portable phones ? they have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever , and maybe something like that , that in each package you have you have let is say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package .
marketing executive : there is a real idea .
project manager : and then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately .
industrial designer : like for mobile phones we have different covers , like designs and all so that w we can have that .
marketing executive : right .
project manager : but like if then everybody is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package , then they can go to the store and for a few francs or euros whatever they can buy
marketing executive : an alternate package .
project manager : an alternate package with another two colours in it .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : but i have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people .
project manager : i think the idea here is to d design one remote
industrial designer : but
marketing executive : we can only aff ,
project manager : and what the only change is gonna be the funct d t
marketing executive : cosmetic .
user interface designer : of th .
project manager : the functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way , having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children five minutes that was i tha that is the old message .
marketing executive : warning , finish meeting now .
project manager : finish meeting now .
marketing executive : we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but
industrial designer : maybe , .
project manager : but
industrial designer : if we do some more research , maybe we .
project manager : to sum it up the target group is everybody . if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : do we agree , do we ?
industrial designer : maybe seventy percent is a unique remote controller and thirty percent is it is like .
marketing executive : but we have to l
project manager : do we agree on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not .
industrial designer : , .
marketing executive : fair enough .
project manager : ? so now i understand it is lunch break . so that is what we will do . so hank you very much . and we will see you after lunch .","the meeting begins and the marketing expert starts her presentation promptly , telling them that her research shows they need a focus- it is not possible to make a device that works on the whole house . the project manager steps in and informs them that they have instructions to eliminate the teletext idea because it is too complicated , and also said they must maintain the corporate image by using corporate designs and colors . the marketing expert resumes , talking about how remotes often get lost and that a light emitter might be useful . the industrial designer gives her presentation , talking about components , materials , and energy sources . they discuss giving the control different shapes to suit both adults and children , making the buttons various shapes , and putting a display clock on the control . the interface designer presents , talking about the features users like on a remote and suggesting that they make the remote a t-shape and add an alarm clock function . they discuss their target group and the possibility of removable plastic cases . they close the meeting deciding to do more research on the plastic cases . they cannot make a device that works on the whole house- will need a focus . they will eliminate teletext . they will maintain the corporate image by using the proper designs and colors . their target group is basically everybody who owns a tv . they are concerned about making the control marketable to a wide range of age groups , and have discussed making removable plastic covers so that the look is changeable . however , they need to do more research on this topic . they do not know if their budget will allow them to include all the features they would like to such as a light emitter , clock , alarm clock , and child lock .
","the project manager opens the meeting by stating that they will address the needs and desires of the user as well as the functional requirements of the device . the user interface designer gives her initial presentation , addressing the needs and desires of the user as well as the budget constraints involved in creating such a device . she lists the most frequently asked questions such as what functions should be included , how to find them when misplaced , what color the device should be , and what features to include in order to meet these needs . the marketing expert presents , talking about the importance of finding a product that is both unique and appealing to the consumer as well as meeting the needs of a particular demographic . he suggests that the product should be yellow or glow in the dark in order to attract the consumer's attention . the project manager closes the meeting . the industrial designer presents , addressing the functional requirements of the device as well as the budget constraints involved in creating such a device . he lists the most frequently asked questions such as what functions should be included , how to find them when misplaced , what color the device should be , and what features to include in order to meet these needs . the marketing expert presents , talking about the importance of finding a product that is both unique and appealing to the consumer as well as meeting the needs of a particular demographic . he suggests that the product should be yellow or glow in the dark in order to attract the consumer's attention . the project manager closes the meeting by thanking each participant . the",x,x,x,,,,,,2.0,Pegasus-Baseline
20,"project manager : hi everyone again .
user interface designer : hello .
industrial designer : hello .
marketing executive : hello
project manager : like before we i have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting
marketing executive :  .
project manager : and so here we go . it was discussed in the last meeting which was opened by the presentation from the interface designer that looks would be very important on this new remote
user interface designer : designer .
project manager : and it is to send messages to the t_v _ . it should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . it should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings . speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal features she would like see d to be integrated in this new remote . should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . she presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose .
marketing executive : and she was challenged on that point
user interface designer : yes .
project manager : but her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . the industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue . she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . should have an integrated circuit board that is highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . and a circuit board . and how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse code related relays the to the generat to the generator amplification and the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature to consider . she would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . should be battery operated and she would have the special cases . the marketing expert who has to finally come up with to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . from her point of view one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . to do that maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really driven home . it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . she feels that is really what people want today . and the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting . now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype .
user interface designer : just the look like , the button part i will explain .
industrial designer : so this is our what we have made . this is a model of the remote control which we are going to build .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : this is us in a snail shape so it is attractive and it is blue in colour bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is a looks - wise it is beautiful . and also compact in shape . and also i it will be easily fit into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer :
marketing executive : you used to have all the buttons
industrial designer : and the material which we are going to use for the case is plastic and w which is s strong and also for the material is plastic and for the buttons it is s soft rubber and als
marketing executive : that is good , no , that is and friendly .
industrial designer : because you will be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it .
marketing executive :  .
project manager :  ,  .
industrial designer : and then for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it is a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared . and and the button is part will be explained by f francina .
user interface designer : now the we decided upon including certain features on our remote . now these features includes the s signal emitting signal it is the led or l_e_d _ the infrared .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : now we have included the switch on and off button . now we have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model . then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes the different channels . we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . now our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button .
project manager : what button ?
user interface designer : menu button .
project manager : menu ? menu th menu , one .
user interface designer : yes , menu
marketing executive : menu button .
user interface designer : at the centre we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness
marketing executive : of the screen .
user interface designer : of this picture . we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . now this is a special , special feature which we have included . now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . it will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button .
marketing executive : the next channel in the numeric pattern , or
user interface designer : no , swapping is if example you are watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : and at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user is voice and then it will act accordingly . so this is our proposed model . now the marketing expert has to
industrial designer : tell , .
user interface designer : give her suggestion whether it will be sellable or it will be cost effective .
marketing executive : what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb ,
user interface designer : yes , yes .
marketing executive : that you can really hold it in one h you do not need two hands
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : and it is easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , ?
project manager : yes the buttons are all raised , right ?
marketing executive : the buttons are all raised
project manager : are raised ,  .
marketing executive : and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you do not have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down ,
project manager : right . or have two hands to operate it , .
marketing executive : i really like that . you really did a good job on that , my little designers . and i like the idea that the on - off button is in a really prominent place . that is that is a really good thing .
project manager : yes , and it sticks up so that you really
marketing executive : that is great .
project manager : you do not have to g first go like here it is on and ,  .
user interface designer : abs .
marketing executive : the colour is very attractive . the these buttons around here are the mute
user interface designer : no , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons .
marketing executive : these  on both sides they are mute ? so you can push either one ?
project manager : so if you are left - handed or right - handed it does not matter .
marketing executive : and this brings the menu up on the screen ?
user interface designer : pardon me ? this is the menu yes , yes .
marketing executive : this brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are
user interface designer : a the these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , and these two are to scroll the programme channels .
marketing executive : f f .
user interface designer : scroll up or scroll down the channels .
marketing executive : right , very good . it looks like something sell . and now i am supposed to
project manager : i have one question will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ?
user interface designer : yes , it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols .
industrial designer : definitely .
project manager : will have symbols so that the user really knows and does not have to first learn it
user interface designer : yes , which can be easily recognised .
marketing executive : good point because we need the symbols we are going into an international market we ca not have anything that is language dependent .
industrial designer : and also
project manager : but anyway it would ha i it has to have some symbols , text so that people kn
industrial designer : we can text .
marketing executive : symbols on it .
industrial designer : text that we can have on the case itself , it will be printed on the case and symbols as the buttons .
project manager : just wanted make of that  .
user interface designer : and and one more feature is we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : a shell shape .
marketing executive : for the snail ,  ,
project manager : right ,  .
industrial designer : so it is
marketing executive : we have the snail shell .
user interface designer : yes , snail shell .
marketing executive : he goes right back into his shell .
industrial designer : shell .
marketing executive : we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail like that
user interface designer :  . y yes
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : that would , that would really work .
project manager : now what , what are our special features for the marketing ?
marketing executive : so
project manager : that is really the voice recognition that is really unusual
marketing executive : voice recognition is our big selling point nobody else seems to have that in this price range .
project manager : and then , and then the other thing would be sh shape or practicality of use .
marketing executive : that everybody is gonna say their remote control is practical . we have to , we have to dwell on the appearance .
project manager : colours .
marketing executive : we are really gonna have the be the
project manager : cutest .
marketing executive : cutest remote control on the block . so we have to play with the image , play with the snail image play with the visual and then the voice recognition . those are the two things to push . the look and the voice recognition . they are gonna be our two selling points .
project manager : now having said that
marketing executive : i am supposed to make a little presentation , are not i ?
project manager : no , now this was our evaluation criteria which we just have done . now we are gonna talk about financing .
marketing executive : but in my instructions it said i was supposed to go to the board and do something .
project manager : there is a production evaluation .
marketing executive : no ?
project manager : is that you ?
marketing executive : that is me .
project manager : but that is after the financing .
marketing executive : .
project manager : we had looks and voice recognition . now on the financing we bring up the there it is . energy source we say that is battery , right ? so we i we use one . t cell or chart you are trying to change is protected . she told me i could just ch change it here and then it would it does not work .
marketing executive : can you just fill it in the yellow boxes ? or
project manager : , let is see . kinetic source so that is in the energy source that is all we need . electronics , simple chip on print ? is that is what we are using ? regular chip on print . that is all we need , the one
industrial designer : no .
project manager : case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved .
industrial designer : this is a
user interface designer : single curve ?
marketing executive : i it is double curved .
project manager : double curved ? case materi s supplements . plastic we said , right ?
user interface designer : plastic .
project manager : wood , rubber ?
marketing executive : rubber , because we are gonna have the soft buttons .
project manager : but , yes but
industrial designer : that is f for rubbers that is case material .
project manager : that is just for the case material ,
user interface designer : is this for the case ?
project manager : so special colours though , we having that ,
marketing executive : the  , mm ' .
project manager : and then we have to interface push buttons . scroll wheel , no . integrated scroll wheel , l_c _ display ?
user interface designer : no .
marketing executive : no ,
project manager : button .
marketing executive : we did not put the clock in it after all , right ?
project manager : no . , button supplement special colour ?
user interface designer : speci yes
project manager : special form ?
user interface designer : yes d we do have special form .
marketing executive : yes .
project manager : and special material , rubber , wood , yes . total seven point six whatever that means .
industrial designer : that is the price .
project manager : that is the price .
user interface designer : one two three four five six seven eight nine
project manager : ?
industrial designer : maybe it is it just n
project manager : eight , eight point two . that is
user interface designer : nine points , yes .
project manager : eight point two , right ? so , we looks like we are within budget . i should save this i suppose , ?
user interface designer : on the desktop .
project manager : tried that . my documents , computer .
industrial designer : ami .
project manager : my compu here it is , yes .
industrial designer : ami should for
project manager : fine . good , so that is the good news . we gonna be popular . so that financing was pretty simple . now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation .
marketing executive : i will take my file down so you can bring it up . should be able to get it now . , why do not you move just to the next slide right away .
project manager : you wanna go to the next slide ?
marketing executive : right away . , my method for s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? and we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio - economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we have not thought of . we ca not accept every suggestion , but maybe we just need to get a few . and show the prototype to consumer research groups , we do not s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and some child will swallow it and then we wo not sell any . so we have to get some input from those people . and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and we like it , we think it is good , we are gonna get behind it and sell it . , now the things that i was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . i wanted the shape to be biomorphic , i did not want anything with angles and all square , i wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we have got that . the size is small , the colour is bright and warm which is what we wanted . we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we will have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped , even though it is gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that is . and functionality i put last on my list because people are not going to use it before they buy it . so paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel and the shape , that is what people are gonna get in the store .
user interface designer : fee selling .
marketing executive : they do not have a television in the store , they ca not play with it . so they will be our main selling points . th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide . , so the shape is a one . that is really , really excellent shape . the size is small and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these are not i in how i feel . that it is plenty small enough to sell but we are right the scale is one to seven . we are right in the middle as far as c other competitors . and our colour is great . the colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . and given the constraints that we had we got it as soft as possible . and then functionality you did a really good job on functionality , we could have ad added different functions but then we would disturb something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on functionality . so that we have got a great product and we can get off and running with it .
project manager : realised one thing . in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . and i how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too .
marketing executive : we had what , eight euros twenty as our cost ?
project manager : eight , eight twenty , yes .
industrial designer : eight twenty so
marketing executive : and so we have got we have still got four euros to go to spend .
industrial designer : we have four euros ,
project manager : maximum we have another four point three euros four thirty .
marketing executive : that is
project manager : but we have no way of presenting that to management as a f finished , as a finished product and saying with the voice recogniser that costs so much . so we just have to beware of that . and know whether the four thirty will really cover that .
marketing executive : as we know in today is technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the problem is quality . so we are just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us .
user interface designer : yes , yes .
marketing executive : and it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway .
industrial designer : still .
marketing executive : as we have seen with so many of these kinds of products .
project manager : i am to interrupt then but recog remembered that there was no that was not included that there was no room for any special features , ?
industrial designer : included , .
project manager : so to beware of that . you wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ?
marketing executive : i is not this my last slide ?
project manager : yes it is .
marketing executive : go ahead . that was my last slide , . and i am supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . and we are supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there . i am i have forgot to do that , .
project manager : why ? wh why you need that up ?
marketing executive : ? because i ca not remember what i put on there . now i am supposed to see how long my leash is here .
project manager : you can make it there .
marketing executive : you ready . so now we are all supposed to say what we think . so on shape i gave it a one . what would you ra one being good and seven being the worst .
user interface designer : worse , .
marketing executive : what do you think the shape is ?
user interface designer : one .
marketing executive : one , and be betsy ?
project manager : yes shape is one .
industrial designer : even my , shape is one .
marketing executive : one , . and how about on size ? on size
project manager : you you gave it a four .
marketing executive : i gave it a four , i feel it is just average .
project manager : . i would give it at least a two .
industrial designer : even it is one . it is quite small .
marketing executive : you are the designer , you wanna give it a one . and then how about how we doing on colour ?
project manager : colour i
marketing executive : colour , i gave it a one .
project manager : one .
marketing executive : i really like all those bright , warm colours .
project manager : i like the colours .
marketing executive : one .
industrial designer : one .
marketing executive : one , one , . and how about the feel ? taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand .
project manager : i would give it a two .
marketing executive : i gave it a three , two ,
user interface designer : i will give three .
marketing executive : three .
industrial designer : maybe two ,
marketing executive : two , . and the next is functionality where i admit i was a little hard on our team here , but
project manager : it is also you ca not really try it out the other things you have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but i will give it a three .
user interface designer : two .
industrial designer : three ,  .
marketing executive : three ? it looks like we have got ourselves a pretty good product . the functionality is the only place where maybe we have to think about m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . but otherwise we are ready to go with this product . anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ?
project manager : here is what we looking at satisfaction on room for creativity . is there more room for creativity or are we happy ?
user interface designer : we can always improve , yes .
industrial designer : maybe we can , include some more buttons and
user interface designer : yes , features .
industrial designer : features . we can make the buttons few buttons smaller . they are quite big , so we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . if we want to have more features than that .
marketing executive : then again if we are gonna do the speech recognition thing we are gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the speech .
user interface designer : voices .
marketing executive : so that is where we are gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons .
industrial designer : definitely , two mu mute buttons .
marketing executive : and then maybe we can do something with the volume control . maybe we can put that all on one button . and a couple of other th maybe comp consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that .
project manager : y al always bearing in mind that right now we are within the budget
user interface designer : and maybe
project manager : and that we still we probably ca not , with this particular item , we probably ca not just add a whole lot of more things .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : we need to leave space money - wise for the voice recogniser . so th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? , are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we are not happy with the new product we created or that was created ? personally i am pretty happy .
marketing executive : i am pretty happy with it too ,
project manager : an
industrial designer : even i am happy .
marketing executive : it is something market .
project manager : and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ?
marketing executive : you have done a good job , miss leader .
user interface designer : yes , yes you have done a good job .
industrial designer : definitely .
project manager : and team work was very good , we really
marketing executive : i d i do too we worked together as a team , .
project manager : and we are we happy with the means we used ? we used whiteboard , we did not use digital p digital pens i are these things .
marketing executive : maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more ,
user interface designer : whiteboard more , yes .
industrial designer : probably .
marketing executive : we did not use that enough .
project manager : yes , we could . , it is maybe not in the best position in the room like sometimes it is positioned so that it is much better visible for everybody and from that point of view we ignored it a little bit .
marketing executive : and we used the slide because it was better positioned .
project manager : yes , so ,
marketing executive : that is true  .
project manager : and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier . did we new did we find new ideas ?
industrial designer : many .
marketing executive : we were very good , .
project manager : we did , in more than one respect and so we did very here . are the costs within budget ? is the project evaluated ?
marketing executive : yes , yes .
project manager : then celebration .
marketing executive : celebration .
user interface designer : cel celebration yes , yes .
marketing executive : today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne .
project manager : so i all very much . , this was very good and we did come up with a new product that is feasible . feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view .
industrial designer : very much .
marketing executive : watch i have my cord behind you here .
project manager : i always get it on here , but getting it off is
industrial designer : do we do we have some time left ? you have
user interface designer : they say it is forty minutes .
project manager : yes we have time later
marketing executive : but we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished .
project manager : but we do not

21,"project manager : hi everyone again .
user interface designer : hello .
industrial designer : hello .
marketing executive : hello
project manager : like before we i have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting
marketing executive :  .
project manager : and so here we go . it was discussed in the last meeting which was opened by the presentation from the interface designer that looks would be very important on this new remote
user interface designer : designer .
project manager : and it is to send messages to the t_v _ . it should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . it should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings . speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal features she would like see d to be integrated in this new remote . should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . she presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose .
marketing executive : and she was challenged on that point
user interface designer : yes .
project manager : but her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . the industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue . she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . should have an integrated circuit board that is highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . and a circuit board . and how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse code related relays the to the generat to the generator amplification and the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature to consider . she would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . should be battery operated and she would have the special cases . the marketing expert who has to finally come up with to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . from her point of view one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . to do that maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really driven home . it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . she feels that is really what people want today . and the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting . now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype .
user interface designer : just the look like , the button part i will explain .
industrial designer : so this is our what we have made . this is a model of the remote control which we are going to build .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : this is us in a snail shape so it is attractive and it is blue in colour bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is a looks - wise it is beautiful . and also compact in shape . and also i it will be easily fit into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer :
marketing executive : you used to have all the buttons
industrial designer : and the material which we are going to use for the case is plastic and w which is s strong and also for the material is plastic and for the buttons it is s soft rubber and als
marketing executive : that is good , no , that is and friendly .
industrial designer : because you will be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it .
marketing executive :  .
project manager :  ,  .
industrial designer : and then for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it is a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared . and and the button is part will be explained by f francina .
user interface designer : now the we decided upon including certain features on our remote . now these features includes the s signal emitting signal it is the led or l_e_d _ the infrared .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : now we have included the switch on and off button . now we have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model . then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes the different channels . we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . now our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button .
project manager : what button ?
user interface designer : menu button .
project manager : menu ? menu th menu , one .
user interface designer : yes , menu
marketing executive : menu button .
user interface designer : at the centre we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness
marketing executive : of the screen .
user interface designer : of this picture . we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . now this is a special , special feature which we have included . now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . it will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button .
marketing executive : the next channel in the numeric pattern , or
user interface designer : no , swapping is if example you are watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : and at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user is voice and then it will act accordingly . so this is our proposed model . now the marketing expert has to
industrial designer : tell , .
user interface designer : give her suggestion whether it will be sellable or it will be cost effective .
marketing executive : what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb ,
user interface designer : yes , yes .
marketing executive : that you can really hold it in one h you do not need two hands
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : and it is easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , ?
project manager : yes the buttons are all raised , right ?
marketing executive : the buttons are all raised
project manager : are raised ,  .
marketing executive : and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you do not have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down ,
project manager : right . or have two hands to operate it , .
marketing executive : i really like that . you really did a good job on that , my little designers . and i like the idea that the on - off button is in a really prominent place . that is that is a really good thing .
project manager : yes , and it sticks up so that you really
marketing executive : that is great .
project manager : you do not have to g first go like here it is on and ,  .
user interface designer : abs .
marketing executive : the colour is very attractive . the these buttons around here are the mute
user interface designer : no , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons .
marketing executive : these  on both sides they are mute ? so you can push either one ?
project manager : so if you are left - handed or right - handed it does not matter .
marketing executive : and this brings the menu up on the screen ?
user interface designer : pardon me ? this is the menu yes , yes .
marketing executive : this brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are
user interface designer : a the these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , and these two are to scroll the programme channels .
marketing executive : f f .
user interface designer : scroll up or scroll down the channels .
marketing executive : right , very good . it looks like something sell . and now i am supposed to
project manager : i have one question will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ?
user interface designer : yes , it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols .
industrial designer : definitely .
project manager : will have symbols so that the user really knows and does not have to first learn it
user interface designer : yes , which can be easily recognised .
marketing executive : good point because we need the symbols we are going into an international market we ca not have anything that is language dependent .
industrial designer : and also
project manager : but anyway it would ha i it has to have some symbols , text so that people kn
industrial designer : we can text .
marketing executive : symbols on it .
industrial designer : text that we can have on the case itself , it will be printed on the case and symbols as the buttons .
project manager : just wanted make of that  .
user interface designer : and and one more feature is we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : a shell shape .
marketing executive : for the snail ,  ,
project manager : right ,  .
industrial designer : so it is
marketing executive : we have the snail shell .
user interface designer : yes , snail shell .
marketing executive : he goes right back into his shell .
industrial designer : shell .
marketing executive : we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail like that
user interface designer :  . y yes
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : that would , that would really work .
project manager : now what , what are our special features for the marketing ?
marketing executive : so
project manager : that is really the voice recognition that is really unusual
marketing executive : voice recognition is our big selling point nobody else seems to have that in this price range .
project manager : and then , and then the other thing would be sh shape or practicality of use .
marketing executive : that everybody is gonna say their remote control is practical . we have to , we have to dwell on the appearance .
project manager : colours .
marketing executive : we are really gonna have the be the
project manager : cutest .
marketing executive : cutest remote control on the block . so we have to play with the image , play with the snail image play with the visual and then the voice recognition . those are the two things to push . the look and the voice recognition . they are gonna be our two selling points .
project manager : now having said that
marketing executive : i am supposed to make a little presentation , are not i ?
project manager : no , now this was our evaluation criteria which we just have done . now we are gonna talk about financing .
marketing executive : but in my instructions it said i was supposed to go to the board and do something .
project manager : there is a production evaluation .
marketing executive : no ?
project manager : is that you ?
marketing executive : that is me .
project manager : but that is after the financing .
marketing executive : .
project manager : we had looks and voice recognition . now on the financing we bring up the there it is . energy source we say that is battery , right ? so we i we use one . t cell or chart you are trying to change is protected . she told me i could just ch change it here and then it would it does not work .
marketing executive : can you just fill it in the yellow boxes ? or
project manager : , let is see . kinetic source so that is in the energy source that is all we need . electronics , simple chip on print ? is that is what we are using ? regular chip on print . that is all we need , the one
industrial designer : no .
project manager : case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved .
industrial designer : this is a
user interface designer : single curve ?
marketing executive : i it is double curved .
project manager : double curved ? case materi s supplements . plastic we said , right ?
user interface designer : plastic .
project manager : wood , rubber ?
marketing executive : rubber , because we are gonna have the soft buttons .
project manager : but , yes but
industrial designer : that is f for rubbers that is case material .
project manager : that is just for the case material ,
user interface designer : is this for the case ?
project manager : so special colours though , we having that ,
marketing executive : the  , mm ' .
project manager : and then we have to interface push buttons . scroll wheel , no . integrated scroll wheel , l_c _ display ?
user interface designer : no .
marketing executive : no ,
project manager : button .
marketing executive : we did not put the clock in it after all , right ?
project manager : no . , button supplement special colour ?
user interface designer : speci yes
project manager : special form ?
user interface designer : yes d we do have special form .
marketing executive : yes .
project manager : and special material , rubber , wood , yes . total seven point six whatever that means .
industrial designer : that is the price .
project manager : that is the price .
user interface designer : one two three four five six seven eight nine
project manager : ?
industrial designer : maybe it is it just n
project manager : eight , eight point two . that is
user interface designer : nine points , yes .
project manager : eight point two , right ? so , we looks like we are within budget . i should save this i suppose , ?
user interface designer : on the desktop .
project manager : tried that . my documents , computer .
industrial designer : ami .
project manager : my compu here it is , yes .
industrial designer : ami should for
project manager : fine . good , so that is the good news . we gonna be popular . so that financing was pretty simple . now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation .
marketing executive : i will take my file down so you can bring it up . should be able to get it now . , why do not you move just to the next slide right away .
project manager : you wanna go to the next slide ?
marketing executive : right away . , my method for s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? and we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio - economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we have not thought of . we ca not accept every suggestion , but maybe we just need to get a few . and show the prototype to consumer research groups , we do not s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and some child will swallow it and then we wo not sell any . so we have to get some input from those people . and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and we like it , we think it is good , we are gonna get behind it and sell it . , now the things that i was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . i wanted the shape to be biomorphic , i did not want anything with angles and all square , i wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we have got that . the size is small , the colour is bright and warm which is what we wanted . we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we will have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped , even though it is gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that is . and functionality i put last on my list because people are not going to use it before they buy it . so paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel and the shape , that is what people are gonna get in the store .
user interface designer : fee selling .
marketing executive : they do not have a television in the store , they ca not play with it . so they will be our main selling points . th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide . , so the shape is a one . that is really , really excellent shape . the size is small and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these are not i in how i feel . that it is plenty small enough to sell but we are right the scale is one to seven . we are right in the middle as far as c other competitors . and our colour is great . the colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . and given the constraints that we had we got it as soft as possible . and then functionality you did a really good job on functionality , we could have ad added different functions but then we would disturb something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on functionality . so that we have got a great product and we can get off and running with it .
project manager : realised one thing . in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . and i how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too .
marketing executive : we had what , eight euros twenty as our cost ?
project manager : eight , eight twenty , yes .
industrial designer : eight twenty so
marketing executive : and so we have got we have still got four euros to go to spend .
industrial designer : we have four euros ,
project manager : maximum we have another four point three euros four thirty .
marketing executive : that is
project manager : but we have no way of presenting that to management as a f finished , as a finished product and saying with the voice recogniser that costs so much . so we just have to beware of that . and know whether the four thirty will really cover that .
marketing executive : as we know in today is technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the problem is quality . so we are just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us .
user interface designer : yes , yes .
marketing executive : and it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway .
industrial designer : still .
marketing executive : as we have seen with so many of these kinds of products .
project manager : i am to interrupt then but recog remembered that there was no that was not included that there was no room for any special features , ?
industrial designer : included , .
project manager : so to beware of that . you wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ?
marketing executive : i is not this my last slide ?
project manager : yes it is .
marketing executive : go ahead . that was my last slide , . and i am supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . and we are supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there . i am i have forgot to do that , .
project manager : why ? wh why you need that up ?
marketing executive : ? because i ca not remember what i put on there . now i am supposed to see how long my leash is here .
project manager : you can make it there .
marketing executive : you ready . so now we are all supposed to say what we think . so on shape i gave it a one . what would you ra one being good and seven being the worst .
user interface designer : worse , .
marketing executive : what do you think the shape is ?
user interface designer : one .
marketing executive : one , and be betsy ?
project manager : yes shape is one .
industrial designer : even my , shape is one .
marketing executive : one , . and how about on size ? on size
project manager : you you gave it a four .
marketing executive : i gave it a four , i feel it is just average .
project manager : . i would give it at least a two .
industrial designer : even it is one . it is quite small .
marketing executive : you are the designer , you wanna give it a one . and then how about how we doing on colour ?
project manager : colour i
marketing executive : colour , i gave it a one .
project manager : one .
marketing executive : i really like all those bright , warm colours .
project manager : i like the colours .
marketing executive : one .
industrial designer : one .
marketing executive : one , one , . and how about the feel ? taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand .
project manager : i would give it a two .
marketing executive : i gave it a three , two ,
user interface designer : i will give three .
marketing executive : three .
industrial designer : maybe two ,
marketing executive : two , . and the next is functionality where i admit i was a little hard on our team here , but
project manager : it is also you ca not really try it out the other things you have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but i will give it a three .
user interface designer : two .
industrial designer : three ,  .
marketing executive : three ? it looks like we have got ourselves a pretty good product . the functionality is the only place where maybe we have to think about m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . but otherwise we are ready to go with this product . anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ?
project manager : here is what we looking at satisfaction on room for creativity . is there more room for creativity or are we happy ?
user interface designer : we can always improve , yes .
industrial designer : maybe we can , include some more buttons and
user interface designer : yes , features .
industrial designer : features . we can make the buttons few buttons smaller . they are quite big , so we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . if we want to have more features than that .
marketing executive : then again if we are gonna do the speech recognition thing we are gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the speech .
user interface designer : voices .
marketing executive : so that is where we are gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons .
industrial designer : definitely , two mu mute buttons .
marketing executive : and then maybe we can do something with the volume control . maybe we can put that all on one button . and a couple of other th maybe comp consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that .
project manager : y al always bearing in mind that right now we are within the budget
user interface designer : and maybe
project manager : and that we still we probably ca not , with this particular item , we probably ca not just add a whole lot of more things .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : we need to leave space money - wise for the voice recogniser . so th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? , are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we are not happy with the new product we created or that was created ? personally i am pretty happy .
marketing executive : i am pretty happy with it too ,
project manager : an
industrial designer : even i am happy .
marketing executive : it is something market .
project manager : and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ?
marketing executive : you have done a good job , miss leader .
user interface designer : yes , yes you have done a good job .
industrial designer : definitely .
project manager : and team work was very good , we really
marketing executive : i d i do too we worked together as a team , .
project manager : and we are we happy with the means we used ? we used whiteboard , we did not use digital p digital pens i are these things .
marketing executive : maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more ,
user interface designer : whiteboard more , yes .
industrial designer : probably .
marketing executive : we did not use that enough .
project manager : yes , we could . , it is maybe not in the best position in the room like sometimes it is positioned so that it is much better visible for everybody and from that point of view we ignored it a little bit .
marketing executive : and we used the slide because it was better positioned .
project manager : yes , so ,
marketing executive : that is true  .
project manager : and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier . did we new did we find new ideas ?
industrial designer : many .
marketing executive : we were very good , .
project manager : we did , in more than one respect and so we did very here . are the costs within budget ? is the project evaluated ?
marketing executive : yes , yes .
project manager : then celebration .
marketing executive : celebration .
user interface designer : cel celebration yes , yes .
marketing executive : today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne .
project manager : so i all very much . , this was very good and we did come up with a new product that is feasible . feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view .
industrial designer : very much .
marketing executive : watch i have my cord behind you here .
project manager : i always get it on here , but getting it off is
industrial designer : do we do we have some time left ? you have
user interface designer : they say it is forty minutes .
project manager : yes we have time later
marketing executive : but we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished .
project manager : but we do not

user interface designer : yes .
project manager : but her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . the industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue . she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . should have an integrated circuit board that is highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . and a circuit board . and how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse code related relays the to the generat to the generator amplification and the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature to consider . she would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . should be battery operated and she would have the special cases . the marketing expert who has to finally come up with to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . from her point of view one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . to do that maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really driven home . it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . she feels that is really what people want today . and the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting . now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype .
user interface designer : just the look like , the button part i will explain .
industrial designer : so this is our what we have made . this is a model of the remote control which we are going to build .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : this is us in a snail shape so it is attractive and it is blue in colour bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is a looks - wise it is beautiful . and also compact in shape . and also i it will be easily fit into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer :
marketing executive : you used to have all the buttons
industrial designer : and the material which we are going to use for the case is plastic and w which is s strong and also for the material is plastic and for the buttons it is s soft rubber and als
marketing executive : that is good , no , that is and friendly .
industrial designer : because you will be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it .
marketing executive :  .
project manager :  ,  .
industrial designer : and then for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it is a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared . and and the button is part will be explained by f francina .
user interface designer : now the we decided upon including certain features on our remote . now these features includes the s signal emitting signal it is the led or l_e_d _ the infrared .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : now we have included the switch on and off button . now we have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model . then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes the different channels . we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . now our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button .
project manager : what button ?
user interface designer : menu button .
project manager : menu ? menu th menu , one .
user interface designer : yes , menu
marketing executive : menu button .
user interface designer : at the centre we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness
marketing executive : of the screen .
user interface designer : of this picture . we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . now this is a special , special feature which we have included . now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . it will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button .
marketing executive : the next channel in the numeric pattern , or
user interface designer : no , swapping is if example you are watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : and at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user is voice and then it will act accordingly . so this is our proposed model . now the marketing expert has to
industrial designer : tell , .
user interface designer : give her suggestion whether it will be sellable or it will be cost effective .
marketing executive : what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb ,
user interface designer : yes , yes .
marketing executive : that you can really hold it in one h you do not need two hands
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : and it is easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , ?
project manager : yes the buttons are all raised , right ?
marketing executive : the buttons are all raised
project manager : are raised ,  .
marketing executive : and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you do not have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down ,
project manager : right . or have two hands to operate it , .
marketing executive : i really like that . you really did a good job on that , my little designers . and i like the idea that the on - off button is in a really prominent place . that is that is a really good thing .
project manager : yes , and it sticks up so that you really
marketing executive : that is great .
project manager : you do not have to g first go like here it is on and ,  .
user interface designer : abs .
marketing executive : the colour is very attractive . the these buttons around here are the mute
user interface designer : no , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons .
marketing executive : these  on both sides they are mute ? so you can push either one ?
project manager : so if you are left - handed or right - handed it does not matter .
marketing executive : and this brings the menu up on the screen ?
user interface designer : pardon me ? this is the menu yes , yes .
marketing executive : this brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are
user interface designer : a the these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , and these two are to scroll the programme channels .
marketing executive : f f .
user interface designer : scroll up or scroll down the channels .
marketing executive : right , very good . it looks like something sell . and now i am supposed to
project manager : i have one question will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ?
user interface designer : yes , it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols .
industrial designer : definitely .
project manager : will have symbols so that the user really knows and does not have to first learn it
user interface designer : yes , which can be easily recognised .
marketing executive : good point because we need the symbols we are going into an international market we ca not have anything that is language dependent .
industrial designer : and also
project manager : but anyway it would ha i it has to have some symbols , text so that people kn
industrial designer : we can text .
marketing executive : symbols on it .
industrial designer : text that we can have on the case itself , it will be printed on the case and symbols as the buttons .
project manager : just wanted make of that  .
user interface designer : and and one more feature is we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : a shell shape .
marketing executive : for the snail ,  ,
project manager : right ,  .
industrial designer : so it is
marketing executive : we have the snail shell .
user interface designer : yes , snail shell .
marketing executive : he goes right back into his shell .
industrial designer : shell .
marketing executive : we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail like that
user interface designer :  . y yes
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : that would , that would really work .
project manager : now what , what are our special features for the marketing ?
marketing executive : so
project manager : that is really the voice recognition that is really unusual
marketing executive : voice recognition is our big selling point nobody else seems to have that in this price range .
project manager : and then , and then the other thing would be sh shape or practicality of use .
marketing executive : that everybody is gonna say their remote control is practical . we have to , we have to dwell on the appearance .
project manager : colours .
marketing executive : we are really gonna have the be the
project manager : cutest .
marketing executive : cutest remote control on the block . so we have to play with the image , play with the snail image play with the visual and then the voice recognition . those are the two things to push . the look and the voice recognition . they are gonna be our two selling points .
project manager : now having said that
marketing executive : i am supposed to make a little presentation , are not i ?
project manager : no , now this was our evaluation criteria which we just have done . now we are gonna talk about financing .
marketing executive : but in my instructions it said i was supposed to go to the board and do something .
project manager : there is a production evaluation .
marketing executive : no ?
project manager : is that you ?
marketing executive : that is me .
project manager : but that is after the financing .
marketing executive : .
project manager : we had looks and voice recognition . now on the financing we bring up the there it is . energy source we say that is battery , right ? so we i we use one . t cell or chart you are trying to change is protected . she told me i could just ch change it here and then it would it does not work .
marketing executive : can you just fill it in the yellow boxes ? or
project manager : , let is see . kinetic source so that is in the energy source that is all we need . electronics , simple chip on print ? is that is what we are using ? regular chip on print . that is all we need , the one
industrial designer : no .
project manager : case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved .
industrial designer : this is a
user interface designer : single curve ?
marketing executive : i it is double curved .
project manager : double curved ? case materi s supplements . plastic we said , right ?
user interface designer : plastic .
project manager : wood , rubber ?
marketing executive : rubber , because we are gonna have the soft buttons .
project manager : but , yes but
industrial designer : that is f for rubbers that is case material .
project manager : that is just for the case material ,
user interface designer : is this for the case ?
project manager : so special colours though , we having that ,
marketing executive : the  , mm ' .
project manager : and then we have to interface push buttons . scroll wheel , no . integrated scroll wheel , l_c _ display ?
user interface designer : no .
marketing executive : no ,
project manager : button .
marketing executive : we did not put the clock in it after all , right ?
project manager : no . , button supplement special colour ?
user interface designer : speci yes
project manager : special form ?
user interface designer : yes d we do have special form .
marketing executive : yes .
project manager : and special material , rubber , wood , yes . total seven point six whatever that means .
industrial designer : that is the price .
project manager : that is the price .
user interface designer : one two three four five six seven eight nine
project manager : ?
industrial designer : maybe it is it just n
project manager : eight , eight point two . that is
user interface designer : nine points , yes .
project manager : eight point two , right ? so , we looks like we are within budget . i should save this i suppose , ?
user interface designer : on the desktop .
project manager : tried that . my documents , computer .
industrial designer : ami .
project manager : my compu here it is , yes .
industrial designer : ami should for
project manager : fine . good , so that is the good news . we gonna be popular . so that financing was pretty simple . now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation .
marketing executive : i will take my file down so you can bring it up . should be able to get it now . , why do not you move just to the next slide right away .
project manager : you wanna go to the next slide ?
marketing executive : right away . , my method for s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? and we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio - economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we have not thought of . we ca not accept every suggestion , but maybe we just need to get a few . and show the prototype to consumer research groups , we do not s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and some child will swallow it and then we wo not sell any . so we have to get some input from those people . and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and we like it , we think it is good , we are gonna get behind it and sell it . , now the things that i was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . i wanted the shape to be biomorphic , i did not want anything with angles and all square , i wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we have got that . the size is small , the colour is bright and warm which is what we wanted . we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we will have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped , even though it is gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that is . and functionality i put last on my list because people are not going to use it before they buy it . so paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel and the shape , that is what people are gonna get in the store .
user interface designer : fee selling .
marketing executive : they do not have a television in the store , they ca not play with it . so they will be our main selling points . th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide . , so the shape is a one . that is really , really excellent shape . the size is small and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these are not i in how i feel . that it is plenty small enough to sell but we are right the scale is one to seven . we are right in the middle as far as c other competitors . and our colour is great . the colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . and given the constraints that we had we got it as soft as possible . and then functionality you did a really good job on functionality , we could have ad added different functions but then we would disturb something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on functionality . so that we have got a great product and we can get off and running with it .
project manager : realised one thing . in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . and i how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too .
marketing executive : we had what , eight euros twenty as our cost ?
project manager : eight , eight twenty , yes .
industrial designer : eight twenty so
marketing executive : and so we have got we have still got four euros to go to spend .
industrial designer : we have four euros ,
project manager : maximum we have another four point three euros four thirty .
marketing executive : that is
project manager : but we have no way of presenting that to management as a f finished , as a finished product and saying with the voice recogniser that costs so much . so we just have to beware of that . and know whether the four thirty will really cover that .
marketing executive : as we know in today is technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the problem is quality . so we are just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us .
user interface designer : yes , yes .
marketing executive : and it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway .
industrial designer : still .
marketing executive : as we have seen with so many of these kinds of products .
project manager : i am to interrupt then but recog remembered that there was no that was not included that there was no room for any special features , ?
industrial designer : included , .
project manager : so to beware of that . you wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ?
marketing executive : i is not this my last slide ?
project manager : yes it is .
marketing executive : go ahead . that was my last slide , . and i am supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . and we are supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there . i am i have forgot to do that , .
project manager : why ? wh why you need that up ?
marketing executive : ? because i ca not remember what i put on there . now i am supposed to see how long my leash is here .
project manager : you can make it there .
marketing executive : you ready . so now we are all supposed to say what we think . so on shape i gave it a one . what would you ra one being good and seven being the worst .
user interface designer : worse , .
marketing executive : what do you think the shape is ?
user interface designer : one .
marketing executive : one , and be betsy ?
project manager : yes shape is one .
industrial designer : even my , shape is one .
marketing executive : one , . and how about on size ? on size
project manager : you you gave it a four .
marketing executive : i gave it a four , i feel it is just average .
project manager : . i would give it at least a two .
industrial designer : even it is one . it is quite small .
marketing executive : you are the designer , you wanna give it a one . and then how about how we doing on colour ?
project manager : colour i
marketing executive : colour , i gave it a one .
project manager : one .
marketing executive : i really like all those bright , warm colours .
project manager : i like the colours .
marketing executive : one .
industrial designer : one .
marketing executive : one , one , . and how about the feel ? taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand .
project manager : i would give it a two .
marketing executive : i gave it a three , two ,
user interface designer : i will give three .
marketing executive : three .
industrial designer : maybe two ,
marketing executive : two , . and the next is functionality where i admit i was a little hard on our team here , but
project manager : it is also you ca not really try it out the other things you have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but i will give it a three .
user interface designer : two .
industrial designer : three ,  .
marketing executive : three ? it looks like we have got ourselves a pretty good product . the functionality is the only place where maybe we have to think about m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . but otherwise we are ready to go with this product . anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ?
project manager : here is what we looking at satisfaction on room for creativity . is there more room for creativity or are we happy ?
user interface designer : we can always improve , yes .
industrial designer : maybe we can , include some more buttons and
user interface designer : yes , features .
industrial designer : features . we can make the buttons few buttons smaller . they are quite big , so we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . if we want to have more features than that .
marketing executive : then again if we are gonna do the speech recognition thing we are gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the speech .
user interface designer : voices .
marketing executive : so that is where we are gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons .
industrial designer : definitely , two mu mute buttons .
marketing executive : and then maybe we can do something with the volume control . maybe we can put that all on one button . and a couple of other th maybe comp consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that .
project manager : y al always bearing in mind that right now we are within the budget
user interface designer : and maybe
project manager : and that we still we probably ca not , with this particular item , we probably ca not just add a whole lot of more things .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : we need to leave space money - wise for the voice recogniser . so th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? , are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we are not happy with the new product we created or that was created ? personally i am pretty happy .
marketing executive : i am pretty happy with it too ,
project manager : an
industrial designer : even i am happy .
marketing executive : it is something market .
project manager : and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ?
marketing executive : you have done a good job , miss leader .
user interface designer : yes , yes you have done a good job .
industrial designer : definitely .
project manager : and team work was very good , we really
marketing executive : i d i do too we worked together as a team , .
project manager : and we are we happy with the means we used ? we used whiteboard , we did not use digital p digital pens i are these things .
marketing executive : maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more ,
user interface designer : whiteboard more , yes .
industrial designer : probably .
marketing executive : we did not use that enough .
project manager : yes , we could . , it is maybe not in the best position in the room like sometimes it is positioned so that it is much better visible for everybody and from that point of view we ignored it a little bit .
marketing executive : and we used the slide because it was better positioned .
project manager : yes , so ,
marketing executive : that is true  .
project manager : and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier . did we new did we find new ideas ?
industrial designer : many .
marketing executive : we were very good , .
project manager : we did , in more than one respect and so we did very here . are the costs within budget ? is the project evaluated ?
marketing executive : yes , yes .
project manager : then celebration .
marketing executive : celebration .
user interface designer : cel celebration yes , yes .
marketing executive : today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne .
project manager : so i all very much . , this was very good and we did come up with a new product that is feasible . feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view .
industrial designer : very much .
marketing executive : watch i have my cord behind you here .
project manager : i always get it on here , but getting it off is
industrial designer : do we do we have some time left ? you have
user interface designer : they say it is forty minutes .
project manager : yes we have time later
marketing executive : but we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished .
project manager : but we do not
industrial designer : alright .
marketing executive : it will take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace . , there we go .","the project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting , detailing the main points of each person's presentation . they do the prototype presentation which includes a model of the remote control . the group discusses this proposed model , approving of the small size and look of it . they goes over finances and are pleased to find that they are well within budget . however , while the marketing expert is doing the product evaulation the group realizes that they neglected to calculate voice recognition into the financing . their cost had been 8.20 euros and they have  4.30 left to cover it , so they decide to settle for whatever quality it will buy . they rate their product on its shape , size , color , feel , and functionality . they discuss the project process , talk briefly about adding more features , and one member suggests eliminating a mute buttons and include a diffferent feature . they are happy with the creativity , leadership , and teamwork within the group , and close the meeting by thanking one another . the remote is a snail shape with bright colors , blue and yellow with multi-colored buttons . compact in size . it includes a remote holder in the shape of a shell . the case will be made of plastic and the buttons of soft rubber . its features will include an on/off button , two mute buttons , nine channel buttons , two buttons for increasing/decreasing the volume , two buttons for scrolling up/down channels , a menu button in the center which controls the color/sharpness/brightness of the picture , and a swapping button . channel buttons numbered , rest of the buttons have symbols indicating function . light emitting diode is flourescent green . in their cost evaluation they got 8.20 , not factoring in the voice recognition feature . they decide to settle for the level of quality the remaining 4.30 euros will get them . the group spent 8.20 euros on their product , but they almost forgot to factor in voice recognition , which may cost more than the 4.30 euros remaining . they will have to settle for whatever level of quality that 4.30 euros can buy .
","the project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting . the user interface designer and the industrial designer presented the prototype they are going to build . they discussed the appearance of the remote , the number of buttons , speech recognition , and the need to incorporate a rechargeable battery into the design of the device . their prototype is shaped like a snail , is made of plastic and rubber , has a fruit and vegetable theme , features a timer and an alarm . it is child-friendly and the buttons are located easily accessible through the case which are located on the top of the case and the case is made out of plastic , which is blue in the case made of a rubbery material . a speech recognition chip will be used to send messages to televisions .",x,,x,,x,x,,,3.0,T5-Baseline
23,"project manager : hi everyone again .
user interface designer : hello .
industrial designer : hello .
marketing executive : hello
project manager : like before we i have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting
marketing executive :  .
project manager : and so here we go . it was discussed in the last meeting which was opened by the presentation from the interface designer that looks would be very important on this new remote
user interface designer : designer .
project manager : and it is to send messages to the t_v _ . it should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . it should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings . speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal features she would like see d to be integrated in this new remote . should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . she presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose .
marketing executive : and she was challenged on that point
user interface designer : yes .
project manager : but her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . the industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue . she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . should have an integrated circuit board that is highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . and a circuit board . and how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse code related relays the to the generat to the generator amplification and the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature to consider . she would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . should be battery operated and she would have the special cases . the marketing expert who has to finally come up with to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . from her point of view one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . to do that maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really driven home . it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . she feels that is really what people want today . and the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting . now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype .
user interface designer : just the look like , the button part i will explain .
industrial designer : so this is our what we have made . this is a model of the remote control which we are going to build .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : this is us in a snail shape so it is attractive and it is blue in colour bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is a looks - wise it is beautiful . and also compact in shape . and also i it will be easily fit into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer :
marketing executive : you used to have all the buttons
industrial designer : and the material which we are going to use for the case is plastic and w which is s strong and also for the material is plastic and for the buttons it is s soft rubber and als
marketing executive : that is good , no , that is and friendly .
industrial designer : because you will be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it .
marketing executive :  .
project manager :  ,  .
industrial designer : and then for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it is a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared . and and the button is part will be explained by f francina .
user interface designer : now the we decided upon including certain features on our remote . now these features includes the s signal emitting signal it is the led or l_e_d _ the infrared .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : now we have included the switch on and off button . now we have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model . then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes the different channels . we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . now our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button .
project manager : what button ?
user interface designer : menu button .
project manager : menu ? menu th menu , one .
user interface designer : yes , menu
marketing executive : menu button .
user interface designer : at the centre we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness
marketing executive : of the screen .
user interface designer : of this picture . we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . now this is a special , special feature which we have included . now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . it will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button .
marketing executive : the next channel in the numeric pattern , or
user interface designer : no , swapping is if example you are watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : and at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user is voice and then it will act accordingly . so this is our proposed model . now the marketing expert has to
industrial designer : tell , .
user interface designer : give her suggestion whether it will be sellable or it will be cost effective .
marketing executive : what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb ,
user interface designer : yes , yes .
marketing executive : that you can really hold it in one h you do not need two hands
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : and it is easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , ?
project manager : yes the buttons are all raised , right ?
marketing executive : the buttons are all raised
project manager : are raised ,  .
marketing executive : and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you do not have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down ,
project manager : right . or have two hands to operate it , .
marketing executive : i really like that . you really did a good job on that , my little designers . and i like the idea that the on - off button is in a really prominent place . that is that is a really good thing .
project manager : yes , and it sticks up so that you really
marketing executive : that is great .
project manager : you do not have to g first go like here it is on and ,  .
user interface designer : abs .
marketing executive : the colour is very attractive . the these buttons around here are the mute
user interface designer : no , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons .
marketing executive : these  on both sides they are mute ? so you can push either one ?
project manager : so if you are left - handed or right - handed it does not matter .
marketing executive : and this brings the menu up on the screen ?
user interface designer : pardon me ? this is the menu yes , yes .
marketing executive : this brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are
user interface designer : a the these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , and these two are to scroll the programme channels .
marketing executive : f f .
user interface designer : scroll up or scroll down the channels .
marketing executive : right , very good . it looks like something sell . and now i am supposed to
project manager : i have one question will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ?
user interface designer : yes , it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols .
industrial designer : definitely .
project manager : will have symbols so that the user really knows and does not have to first learn it
user interface designer : yes , which can be easily recognised .
marketing executive : good point because we need the symbols we are going into an international market we ca not have anything that is language dependent .
industrial designer : and also
project manager : but anyway it would ha i it has to have some symbols , text so that people kn
industrial designer : we can text .
marketing executive : symbols on it .
industrial designer : text that we can have on the case itself , it will be printed on the case and symbols as the buttons .
project manager : just wanted make of that  .
user interface designer : and and one more feature is we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : a shell shape .
marketing executive : for the snail ,  ,
project manager : right ,  .
industrial designer : so it is
marketing executive : we have the snail shell .
user interface designer : yes , snail shell .
marketing executive : he goes right back into his shell .
industrial designer : shell .
marketing executive : we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail like that
user interface designer :  . y yes
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : that would , that would really work .
project manager : now what , what are our special features for the marketing ?
marketing executive : so
project manager : that is really the voice recognition that is really unusual
marketing executive : voice recognition is our big selling point nobody else seems to have that in this price range .
project manager : and then , and then the other thing would be sh shape or practicality of use .
marketing executive : that everybody is gonna say their remote control is practical . we have to , we have to dwell on the appearance .
project manager : colours .
marketing executive : we are really gonna have the be the
project manager : cutest .
marketing executive : cutest remote control on the block . so we have to play with the image , play with the snail image play with the visual and then the voice recognition . those are the two things to push . the look and the voice recognition . they are gonna be our two selling points .
project manager : now having said that
marketing executive : i am supposed to make a little presentation , are not i ?
project manager : no , now this was our evaluation criteria which we just have done . now we are gonna talk about financing .
marketing executive : but in my instructions it said i was supposed to go to the board and do something .
project manager : there is a production evaluation .
marketing executive : no ?
project manager : is that you ?
marketing executive : that is me .
project manager : but that is after the financing .
marketing executive : .
project manager : we had looks and voice recognition . now on the financing we bring up the there it is . energy source we say that is battery , right ? so we i we use one . t cell or chart you are trying to change is protected . she told me i could just ch change it here and then it would it does not work .
marketing executive : can you just fill it in the yellow boxes ? or
project manager : , let is see . kinetic source so that is in the energy source that is all we need . electronics , simple chip on print ? is that is what we are using ? regular chip on print . that is all we need , the one
industrial designer : no .
project manager : case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved .
industrial designer : this is a
user interface designer : single curve ?
marketing executive : i it is double curved .
project manager : double curved ? case materi s supplements . plastic we said , right ?
user interface designer : plastic .
project manager : wood , rubber ?
marketing executive : rubber , because we are gonna have the soft buttons .
project manager : but , yes but
industrial designer : that is f for rubbers that is case material .
project manager : that is just for the case material ,
user interface designer : is this for the case ?
project manager : so special colours though , we having that ,
marketing executive : the  , mm ' .
project manager : and then we have to interface push buttons . scroll wheel , no . integrated scroll wheel , l_c _ display ?
user interface designer : no .
marketing executive : no ,
project manager : button .
marketing executive : we did not put the clock in it after all , right ?
project manager : no . , button supplement special colour ?
user interface designer : speci yes
project manager : special form ?
user interface designer : yes d we do have special form .
marketing executive : yes .
project manager : and special material , rubber , wood , yes . total seven point six whatever that means .
industrial designer : that is the price .
project manager : that is the price .
user interface designer : one two three four five six seven eight nine
project manager : ?
industrial designer : maybe it is it just n
project manager : eight , eight point two . that is
user interface designer : nine points , yes .
project manager : eight point two , right ? so , we looks like we are within budget . i should save this i suppose , ?
user interface designer : on the desktop .
project manager : tried that . my documents , computer .
industrial designer : ami .
project manager : my compu here it is , yes .
industrial designer : ami should for
project manager : fine . good , so that is the good news . we gonna be popular . so that financing was pretty simple . now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation .
marketing executive : i will take my file down so you can bring it up . should be able to get it now . , why do not you move just to the next slide right away .
project manager : you wanna go to the next slide ?
marketing executive : right away . , my method for s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? and we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio - economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we have not thought of . we ca not accept every suggestion , but maybe we just need to get a few . and show the prototype to consumer research groups , we do not s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and some child will swallow it and then we wo not sell any . so we have to get some input from those people . and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and we like it , we think it is good , we are gonna get behind it and sell it . , now the things that i was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . i wanted the shape to be biomorphic , i did not want anything with angles and all square , i wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we have got that . the size is small , the colour is bright and warm which is what we wanted . we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we will have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped , even though it is gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that is . and functionality i put last on my list because people are not going to use it before they buy it . so paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel and the shape , that is what people are gonna get in the store .
user interface designer : fee selling .
marketing executive : they do not have a television in the store , they ca not play with it . so they will be our main selling points . th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide . , so the shape is a one . that is really , really excellent shape . the size is small and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these are not i in how i feel . that it is plenty small enough to sell but we are right the scale is one to seven . we are right in the middle as far as c other competitors . and our colour is great . the colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . and given the constraints that we had we got it as soft as possible . and then functionality you did a really good job on functionality , we could have ad added different functions but then we would disturb something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on functionality . so that we have got a great product and we can get off and running with it .
project manager : realised one thing . in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . and i how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too .
marketing executive : we had what , eight euros twenty as our cost ?
project manager : eight , eight twenty , yes .
industrial designer : eight twenty so
marketing executive : and so we have got we have still got four euros to go to spend .
industrial designer : we have four euros ,
project manager : maximum we have another four point three euros four thirty .
marketing executive : that is
project manager : but we have no way of presenting that to management as a f finished , as a finished product and saying with the voice recogniser that costs so much . so we just have to beware of that . and know whether the four thirty will really cover that .
marketing executive : as we know in today is technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the problem is quality . so we are just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us .
user interface designer : yes , yes .
marketing executive : and it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway .
industrial designer : still .
marketing executive : as we have seen with so many of these kinds of products .
project manager : i am to interrupt then but recog remembered that there was no that was not included that there was no room for any special features , ?
industrial designer : included , .
project manager : so to beware of that . you wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ?
marketing executive : i is not this my last slide ?
project manager : yes it is .
marketing executive : go ahead . that was my last slide , . and i am supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . and we are supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there . i am i have forgot to do that , .
project manager : why ? wh why you need that up ?
marketing executive : ? because i ca not remember what i put on there . now i am supposed to see how long my leash is here .
project manager : you can make it there .
marketing executive : you ready . so now we are all supposed to say what we think . so on shape i gave it a one . what would you ra one being good and seven being the worst .
user interface designer : worse , .
marketing executive : what do you think the shape is ?
user interface designer : one .
marketing executive : one , and be betsy ?
project manager : yes shape is one .
industrial designer : even my , shape is one .
marketing executive : one , . and how about on size ? on size
project manager : you you gave it a four .
marketing executive : i gave it a four , i feel it is just average .
project manager : . i would give it at least a two .
industrial designer : even it is one . it is quite small .
marketing executive : you are the designer , you wanna give it a one . and then how about how we doing on colour ?
project manager : colour i
marketing executive : colour , i gave it a one .
project manager : one .
marketing executive : i really like all those bright , warm colours .
project manager : i like the colours .
marketing executive : one .
industrial designer : one .
marketing executive : one , one , . and how about the feel ? taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand .
project manager : i would give it a two .
marketing executive : i gave it a three , two ,
user interface designer : i will give three .
marketing executive : three .
industrial designer : maybe two ,
marketing executive : two , . and the next is functionality where i admit i was a little hard on our team here , but
project manager : it is also you ca not really try it out the other things you have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but i will give it a three .
user interface designer : two .
industrial designer : three ,  .
marketing executive : three ? it looks like we have got ourselves a pretty good product . the functionality is the only place where maybe we have to think about m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . but otherwise we are ready to go with this product . anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ?
project manager : here is what we looking at satisfaction on room for creativity . is there more room for creativity or are we happy ?
user interface designer : we can always improve , yes .
industrial designer : maybe we can , include some more buttons and
user interface designer : yes , features .
industrial designer : features . we can make the buttons few buttons smaller . they are quite big , so we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . if we want to have more features than that .
marketing executive : then again if we are gonna do the speech recognition thing we are gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the speech .
user interface designer : voices .
marketing executive : so that is where we are gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons .
industrial designer : definitely , two mu mute buttons .
marketing executive : and then maybe we can do something with the volume control . maybe we can put that all on one button . and a couple of other th maybe comp consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that .
project manager : y al always bearing in mind that right now we are within the budget
user interface designer : and maybe
project manager : and that we still we probably ca not , with this particular item , we probably ca not just add a whole lot of more things .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : we need to leave space money - wise for the voice recogniser . so th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? , are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we are not happy with the new product we created or that was created ? personally i am pretty happy .
marketing executive : i am pretty happy with it too ,
project manager : an
industrial designer : even i am happy .
marketing executive : it is something market .
project manager : and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ?
marketing executive : you have done a good job , miss leader .
user interface designer : yes , yes you have done a good job .
industrial designer : definitely .
project manager : and team work was very good , we really
marketing executive : i d i do too we worked together as a team , .
project manager : and we are we happy with the means we used ? we used whiteboard , we did not use digital p digital pens i are these things .
marketing executive : maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more ,
user interface designer : whiteboard more , yes .
industrial designer : probably .
marketing executive : we did not use that enough .
project manager : yes , we could . , it is maybe not in the best position in the room like sometimes it is positioned so that it is much better visible for everybody and from that point of view we ignored it a little bit .
marketing executive : and we used the slide because it was better positioned .
project manager : yes , so ,
marketing executive : that is true  .
project manager : and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier . did we new did we find new ideas ?
industrial designer : many .
marketing executive : we were very good , .
project manager : we did , in more than one respect and so we did very here . are the costs within budget ? is the project evaluated ?
marketing executive : yes , yes .
project manager : then celebration .
marketing executive : celebration .
user interface designer : cel celebration yes , yes .
marketing executive : today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne .
project manager : so i all very much . , this was very good and we did come up with a new product that is feasible . feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view .
industrial designer : very much .
marketing executive : watch i have my cord behind you here .
project manager : i always get it on here , but getting it off is
industrial designer : do we do we have some time left ? you have
user interface designer : they say it is forty minutes .
project manager : yes we have time later
marketing executive : but we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished .
project manager : but we do not
industrial designer : alright .
marketing executive : it will take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace . , there we go .","the project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting , detailing the main points of each person's presentation . they do the prototype presentation which includes a model of the remote control . the group discusses this proposed model , approving of the small size and look of it . they goes over finances and are pleased to find that they are well within budget . however , while the marketing expert is doing the product evaulation the group realizes that they neglected to calculate voice recognition into the financing . their cost had been 8.20 euros and they have  4.30 left to cover it , so they decide to settle for whatever quality it will buy . they rate their product on its shape , size , color , feel , and functionality . they discuss the project process , talk briefly about adding more features , and one member suggests eliminating a mute buttons and include a diffferent feature . they are happy with the creativity , leadership , and teamwork within the group , and close the meeting by thanking one another . the remote is a snail shape with bright colors , blue and yellow with multi-colored buttons . compact in size . it includes a remote holder in the shape of a shell . the case will be made of plastic and the buttons of soft rubber . its features will include an on/off button , two mute buttons , nine channel buttons , two buttons for increasing/decreasing the volume , two buttons for scrolling up/down channels , a menu button in the center which controls the color/sharpness/brightness of the picture , and a swapping button . channel buttons numbered , rest of the buttons have symbols indicating function . light emitting diode is flourescent green . in their cost evaluation they got 8.20 , not factoring in the voice recognition feature . they decide to settle for the level of quality the remaining 4.30 euros will get them . the group spent 8.20 euros on their product , but they almost forgot to factor in voice recognition , which may cost more than the 4.30 euros remaining . they will have to settle for whatever level of quality that 4.30 euros can buy .
","the user interface designer and the industrial designer presented the prototype for the new remote the group is to create and discussed the features that they would like to see in the product . the marketing expert presented personal preferences for the features to be included in the device . she discussed making the remote child-friendly , having few buttons , a fruit and vegetable design , and being small , compact , strong , soft . this was followed by the decision to include a speech recogniser as one of the main features . a separate scrolling function will be used instead of the old style with a snail shaped device which is made of plastic , the case is blue and yellow , which is soft , made of the case . it will contain a rechargeable battery and will use a thermosmartv and a timer with each button having nine channels , volume switch , channel numbers , changeable and mute-red color . an lcd screen will be included but the remote will not have a teletext feature . all participants will fill out a drawing of the remote which is to be used only for televisions . there will be a back button to return to the television , to move up or down , in a special case made from plastic . both the group and the corporate logo of rubber . meeting the goal was to get more information than the company colours and design . after the group decided that they will have buttons",x,,,x,,,x,x,4.0,T5-Cons
24,"project manager : so good morning .
user interface designer : morning .
marketing executive : morning .
project manager : i see you all find your places .
industrial designer : morning .
project manager : is everybody sitting on the right place ? first i will introduce myself . i if everybody knows me , so i am bart ,
marketing executive : my name is frank .
project manager : hello .
user interface designer : i am .
project manager : bart . let is start off with a little presentation . now first i will tell you a little bit about the setting . you can see there are a few cameras here . they will record our actions and you will have wires and microphones that will record your voice . there are also some microphones there but th you do not have to pay a lot of attention on those , because it will disappear when you do not attend to it . is there a project documents folder ? there are some notes in it already i see , some documents . i will start with the presentation kick off . is being modified by the administrator .
marketing executive : that is interesting .
project manager : let is do it read only . i if you have noticed , but we are working for real reaction . it is a company in electronics . we put fashion in electronics , we make it work , we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . i am bart the project manager so i will direct you through the project . this is our agenda . we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing . maybe sit down , then take some notes or maybe you can take the minutes once in a while . it is not a lot of work , but just if you hear something you can write down , just write it down . as you can see it is the opening , aquaintance tool training . aquaintance is a point we have done a bit . have you all seen the corporate website already ?
marketing executive : .
project manager : have you seen any flaws in it ?
user interface designer : ?
marketing executive : ca not say i paid much attention to it ,
project manager : see if it works this way . no , it does not work here . but on the corporate information side there is a th there was real remote instead of real reaction . real remote is not really the company we are we are , but it is just a little fault .
user interface designer : .
project manager : what are we going to do ? our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . it has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . so these are the points why we also hired you . we have got the marketing expert for the trendy and user friendly look . and industrial designer there is also user friendly and a bit original . and we have got our user interface designer . he is also that is about the new remote control . project method is there are three phases we are going through . first is functional des design , individual work , meetings . after the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design . i had some role indications on here . but it already by yourself . the industrial designer is going to work on the working design , components design and a bit of the look and feel design . the user interface designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . and the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project product ev evaluation . so that is a bit what you are going to do . but that will be all worked out in other meetings . then we have got our first tool training . we are going to work with a lot of high - tech tools here , so it is ab it is handy if we have a little bit of training first . as you can see we have got the smart boards here and here in the white board . in the white board here there is a little tool bar on this side . here are some functions . n these functions we do not have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little piece of drawing . a blank new document for each person . select a pen , eraser . capture we do not have to do anything with . then we have got our pen . it is really funny because you can draw with it on this page in the think it is form of . you can also select the current colour and the line width . but then first you have to select the pen function . but we are going to work with it in a minute . that is very simple and it is easy to draw your findings and drawings on there . then a short thing about documents . we have got our shared folder , project what was it ? project documents . but all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be . and these are available on the smart boards as , so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder . here is a simple tool bar . it is what said , it is save , print , move back or forward one page . you can switch between the different drawings . and then we are going to try out the white board . as you can see we g all going to draw a animal . just to just to get a bit familiar with it . mouse was not running away .
marketing executive : that was interesting .
project manager : is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse ?
marketing executive : innocent .
project manager : we are going to draw animal . and just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics . the only thing we have to look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . there is start from now . you can use this pen by holding it like a little child . because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing wo not get good . another thing is you have to be a bit slow . if you are going to draw like really fast then the pen wo not hold up . we choose form of current colour grey is appropriate . then the line width . seven will be . now you will see my drawing capabilities . these are not very much , but , see you have to do it real slow . i was trying to draw a dolphin , but his nose has to be a little bit but it is close .
marketing executive : i am thinking about a swordfish .
project manager : so what it is this is bit of the swordfish . he has not got an eye .
industrial designer :  .
project manager : woah . now we have got another function . we have got the eraser . and then you can undo this easily .
marketing executive : meat .
project manager : it is . and i have got to write down a few of its characteristics . is they have got no text tool , no . this is typically a undo action , . maybe you have to hold it a bit upside - down . that is it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . but i , i am just trying . this is not my work , maybe you have to use . it is a it wants to draw a another animal ? it lives for the fun . it is my characteristic about the dolphin . it lives for the fun . now i am gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you .
marketing executive : gonna use a different line width . and i am gonna draw in black . , i am not much of an artist , but here we go .
project manager : maybe it is easier to draw the smaller line width , . because this is going a lot better than i did .
user interface designer : a sheep .
marketing executive : this is my .
project manager : it is .
marketing executive : with little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts .
project manager : it is a real dead sheep , for recognition , i see . maybe you can also write your name somewhere . on just a
marketing executive : they are come on . you have to go really slow when you are writing . they are brilliant animal animals . and that is just a little me thingy . i will pass the pen to our user interface designer .
user interface designer : i am just gonna draw its head , but let is see .
project manager : sweet .
marketing executive : interesting .
user interface designer : what that is ?
industrial designer : garfield .
marketing executive : a rabbit ?
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : garfield .
user interface designer : just a so . that is enough . , you say a blank ,
project manager : just a blank sheet .
user interface designer : or
industrial designer : i was gonna draw a cat too , so . i will just try something else . something different than garfield . mine is a bit more skinny .
project manager : it is pretty skinny cat .
industrial designer : but
marketing executive : and the most interesting tail .
project manager : is your cat , or did you find him on the street ?
industrial designer : it is supposed to be a cat . i like cats because they are independent .
project manager : that is pretty clear . everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask and go ahead . it is pretty easy . s
marketing executive : we are being haunted .
project manager : haunted white board . we have got the tool introduction . we move along to the project finance . as you can see , we for our remote control , a selling price is twenty five euros . our selling price . our profit aim is fifty million euros . that is the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . we can do it international , so we have to focus on different users , different cultures , and different trends as . but that is all in the later stadium . our production cost can be maximal twelve and a half euros , so that is also a point we have to keep in mind , that we wo not make remote controls with small televisions inside , and like that . it wo not work . just try to remember these points . selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million , but more important is the int international market we are trying to focus on . and production cost maximal twelve and a half euros . that is leads us to our little discussion . we have got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . i am gonna sit down , .
marketing executive : you got a message .
project manager : i have got a message .
user interface designer : five minutes , .
project manager : that is good timing .
marketing executive : so just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ?
project manager : maybe you have to say the magic word .
marketing executive : .
project manager : does it do anything ?
marketing executive : no .
project manager : maybe you have to just clap it down ? back up again . no slide show .
marketing executive : it is off now .
project manager : it is off . now you have to put it back o you will be , .
marketing executive : it was on , but
project manager : it is those laptops .
marketing executive : there we are .
project manager : . but so does everybody has experiences with remote controls , and not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? like you can use for other ?
user interface designer : really ?
project manager : you ?
user interface designer : it is a
industrial designer : no , me neither .
marketing executive : we have a broad t_v _ at home , and a d_v_d _ player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the t_v _ , one for the video recorder , one for the d_v_d _ player . and it is it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all .
project manager : i have got one at home . and you can program eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and it also operates on infra - red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . so that is pretty handy when you have a video recorder or d_v_d _ player downstairs and you have got a link to your t_v _ on the second floor . so that is a pretty handy
marketing executive : really .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : thing . but only the that if you can put different devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as . it is that is good to remember .
marketing executive : you can take minutes again .
project manager : that is , .
marketing executive : since it is your job .
project manager : we have we want different functions and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra - red . but i if that will exceed the production costs . so that that is something we have to find out , .
marketing executive : but that would be really good if we could do that .
project manager : and other functions for a remote control ? maybe we can make it
marketing executive : think it has to be shock proof
project manager : shock proof .
marketing executive : my remote control tends to fall a lot .
user interface designer : waterproof , you never no know , i w
project manager : waterproof . so these are our a few things we can think of . i will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder .
marketing executive : one other little thing . thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it .
project manager : that is a
marketing executive : so you can see
project manager : battery stays .
marketing executive : how much is left in the battery . but they will also really drag up the production costs , so think we will have to see about that too . but maybe just a little led , i .
project manager : that is an idea as .
industrial designer : nope . they were all mentioned , so
project manager : any questions about this presentation ? kick off presentation .
marketing executive : . nope , do not .
project manager : then i will put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder , and then we can all work . finish meeting now . and we can all work on our own projects .
marketing executive : aye sir .

user interface designer : ?
marketing executive : ca not say i paid much attention to it ,
project manager : see if it works this way . no , it does not work here . but on the corporate information side there is a th there was real remote instead of real reaction . real remote is not really the company we are we are , but it is just a little fault .
user interface designer : .
project manager : what are we going to do ? our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . it has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . so these are the points why we also hired you . we have got the marketing expert for the trendy and user friendly look . and industrial designer there is also user friendly and a bit original . and we have got our user interface designer . he is also that is about the new remote control . project method is there are three phases we are going through . first is functional des design , individual work , meetings . after the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design . i had some role indications on here . but it already by yourself . the industrial designer is going to work on the working design , components design and a bit of the look and feel design . the user interface designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . and the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project product ev evaluation . so that is a bit what you are going to do . but that will be all worked out in other meetings . then we have got our first tool training . we are going to work with a lot of high - tech tools here , so it is ab it is handy if we have a little bit of training first . as you can see we have got the smart boards here and here in the white board . in the white board here there is a little tool bar on this side . here are some functions . n these functions we do not have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little piece of drawing . a blank new document for each person . select a pen , eraser . capture we do not have to do anything with . then we have got our pen . it is really funny because you can draw with it on this page in the think it is form of . you can also select the current colour and the line width . but then first you have to select the pen function . but we are going to work with it in a minute . that is very simple and it is easy to draw your findings and drawings on there . then a short thing about documents . we have got our shared folder , project what was it ? project documents . but all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be . and these are available on the smart boards as , so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder . here is a simple tool bar . it is what said , it is save , print , move back or forward one page . you can switch between the different drawings . and then we are going to try out the white board . as you can see we g all going to draw a animal . just to just to get a bit familiar with it . mouse was not running away .
marketing executive : that was interesting .
project manager : is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse ?
marketing executive : innocent .
project manager : we are going to draw animal . and just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics . the only thing we have to look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . there is start from now . you can use this pen by holding it like a little child . because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing wo not get good . another thing is you have to be a bit slow . if you are going to draw like really fast then the pen wo not hold up . we choose form of current colour grey is appropriate . then the line width . seven will be . now you will see my drawing capabilities . these are not very much , but , see you have to do it real slow . i was trying to draw a dolphin , but his nose has to be a little bit but it is close .
marketing executive : i am thinking about a swordfish .
project manager : so what it is this is bit of the swordfish . he has not got an eye .
industrial designer :  .
project manager : woah . now we have got another function . we have got the eraser . and then you can undo this easily .
marketing executive : meat .
project manager : it is . and i have got to write down a few of its characteristics . is they have got no text tool , no . this is typically a undo action , . maybe you have to hold it a bit upside - down . that is it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . but i , i am just trying . this is not my work , maybe you have to use . it is a it wants to draw a another animal ? it lives for the fun . it is my characteristic about the dolphin . it lives for the fun . now i am gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you .
marketing executive : gonna use a different line width . and i am gonna draw in black . , i am not much of an artist , but here we go .
project manager : maybe it is easier to draw the smaller line width , . because this is going a lot better than i did .
user interface designer : a sheep .
marketing executive : this is my .
project manager : it is .
marketing executive : with little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts .
project manager : it is a real dead sheep , for recognition , i see . maybe you can also write your name somewhere . on just a
marketing executive : they are come on . you have to go really slow when you are writing . they are brilliant animal animals . and that is just a little me thingy . i will pass the pen to our user interface designer .
user interface designer : i am just gonna draw its head , but let is see .
project manager : sweet .
marketing executive : interesting .
user interface designer : what that is ?
industrial designer : garfield .
marketing executive : a rabbit ?
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : garfield .
user interface designer : just a so . that is enough . , you say a blank ,
project manager : just a blank sheet .
user interface designer : or
industrial designer : i was gonna draw a cat too , so . i will just try something else . something different than garfield . mine is a bit more skinny .
project manager : it is pretty skinny cat .
industrial designer : but
marketing executive : and the most interesting tail .
project manager : is your cat , or did you find him on the street ?
industrial designer : it is supposed to be a cat . i like cats because they are independent .
project manager : that is pretty clear . everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask and go ahead . it is pretty easy . s
marketing executive : we are being haunted .
project manager : haunted white board . we have got the tool introduction . we move along to the project finance . as you can see , we for our remote control , a selling price is twenty five euros . our selling price . our profit aim is fifty million euros . that is the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . we can do it international , so we have to focus on different users , different cultures , and different trends as . but that is all in the later stadium . our production cost can be maximal twelve and a half euros , so that is also a point we have to keep in mind , that we wo not make remote controls with small televisions inside , and like that . it wo not work . just try to remember these points . selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million , but more important is the int international market we are trying to focus on . and production cost maximal twelve and a half euros . that is leads us to our little discussion . we have got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . i am gonna sit down , .
marketing executive : you got a message .
project manager : i have got a message .
user interface designer : five minutes , .
project manager : that is good timing .
marketing executive : so just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ?
project manager : maybe you have to say the magic word .
marketing executive : .
project manager : does it do anything ?
marketing executive : no .
project manager : maybe you have to just clap it down ? back up again . no slide show .
marketing executive : it is off now .
project manager : it is off . now you have to put it back o you will be , .
marketing executive : it was on , but
project manager : it is those laptops .
marketing executive : there we are .
project manager : . but so does everybody has experiences with remote controls , and not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? like you can use for other ?
user interface designer : really ?
project manager : you ?
user interface designer : it is a
industrial designer : no , me neither .
marketing executive : we have a broad t_v _ at home , and a d_v_d _ player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the t_v _ , one for the video recorder , one for the d_v_d _ player . and it is it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all .
project manager : i have got one at home . and you can program eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and it also operates on infra - red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . so that is pretty handy when you have a video recorder or d_v_d _ player downstairs and you have got a link to your t_v _ on the second floor . so that is a pretty handy
marketing executive : really .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : thing . but only the that if you can put different devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as . it is that is good to remember .
marketing executive : you can take minutes again .
project manager : that is , .
marketing executive : since it is your job .
project manager : we have we want different functions and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra - red . but i if that will exceed the production costs . so that that is something we have to find out , .
marketing executive : but that would be really good if we could do that .
project manager : and other functions for a remote control ? maybe we can make it
marketing executive : think it has to be shock proof
project manager : shock proof .
marketing executive : my remote control tends to fall a lot .

project manager : that is a
marketing executive : so you can see
project manager : battery stays .

project manager : let is do it read only . i if you have noticed , but we are working for real reaction . it is a company in electronics . we put fashion in electronics , we make it work , we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . i am bart the project manager so i will direct you through the project . this is our agenda . we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing . maybe sit down , then take some notes or maybe you can take the minutes once in a while . it is not a lot of work , but just if you hear something you can write down , just write it down . as you can see it is the opening , aquaintance tool training . aquaintance is a point we have done a bit . have you all seen the corporate website already ?
marketing executive : .
project manager : have you seen any flaws in it ?
user interface designer : ?
marketing executive : ca not say i paid much attention to it ,
project manager : see if it works this way . no , it does not work here . but on the corporate information side there is a th there was real remote instead of real reaction . real remote is not really the company we are we are , but it is just a little fault .
user interface designer : .
project manager : what are we going to do ? our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . it has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . so these are the points why we also hired you . we have got the marketing expert for the trendy and user friendly look . and industrial designer there is also user friendly and a bit original . and we have got our user interface designer . he is also that is about the new remote control . project method is there are three phases we are going through . first is functional des design , individual work , meetings . after the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design . i had some role indications on here . but it already by yourself . the industrial designer is going to work on the working design , components design and a bit of the look and feel design . the user interface designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . and the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project product ev evaluation . so that is a bit what you are going to do . but that will be all worked out in other meetings . then we have got our first tool training . we are going to work with a lot of high - tech tools here , so it is ab it is handy if we have a little bit of training first . as you can see we have got the smart boards here and here in the white board . in the white board here there is a little tool bar on this side . here are some functions . n these functions we do not have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little piece of drawing . a blank new document for each person . select a pen , eraser . capture we do not have to do anything with . then we have got our pen . it is really funny because you can draw with it on this page in the think it is form of . you can also select the current colour and the line width . but then first you have to select the pen function . but we are going to work with it in a minute . that is very simple and it is easy to draw your findings and drawings on there . then a short thing about documents . we have got our shared folder , project what was it ? project documents . but all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be . and these are available on the smart boards as , so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder . here is a simple tool bar . it is what said , it is save , print , move back or forward one page . you can switch between the different drawings . and then we are going to try out the white board . as you can see we g all going to draw a animal . just to just to get a bit familiar with it . mouse was not running away .
marketing executive : that was interesting .
project manager : is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse ?
marketing executive : innocent .
project manager : we are going to draw animal . and just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics . the only thing we have to look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . there is start from now . you can use this pen by holding it like a little child . because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing wo not get good . another thing is you have to be a bit slow . if you are going to draw like really fast then the pen wo not hold up . we choose form of current colour grey is appropriate . then the line width . seven will be . now you will see my drawing capabilities . these are not very much , but , see you have to do it real slow . i was trying to draw a dolphin , but his nose has to be a little bit but it is close .
marketing executive : i am thinking about a swordfish .
project manager : so what it is this is bit of the swordfish . he has not got an eye .
industrial designer :  .
project manager : woah . now we have got another function . we have got the eraser . and then you can undo this easily .
marketing executive : meat .
project manager : it is . and i have got to write down a few of its characteristics . is they have got no text tool , no . this is typically a undo action , . maybe you have to hold it a bit upside - down . that is it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . but i , i am just trying . this is not my work , maybe you have to use . it is a it wants to draw a another animal ? it lives for the fun . it is my characteristic about the dolphin . it lives for the fun . now i am gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you .
marketing executive : gonna use a different line width . and i am gonna draw in black . , i am not much of an artist , but here we go .
project manager : maybe it is easier to draw the smaller line width , . because this is going a lot better than i did .
user interface designer : a sheep .
marketing executive : this is my .
project manager : it is .
marketing executive : with little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts .
project manager : it is a real dead sheep , for recognition , i see . maybe you can also write your name somewhere . on just a
marketing executive : they are come on . you have to go really slow when you are writing . they are brilliant animal animals . and that is just a little me thingy . i will pass the pen to our user interface designer .
user interface designer : i am just gonna draw its head , but let is see .
project manager : sweet .
marketing executive : interesting .
user interface designer : what that is ?
industrial designer : garfield .
marketing executive : a rabbit ?
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : garfield .
user interface designer : just a so . that is enough . , you say a blank ,
project manager : just a blank sheet .
user interface designer : or
industrial designer : i was gonna draw a cat too , so . i will just try something else . something different than garfield . mine is a bit more skinny .
project manager : it is pretty skinny cat .
industrial designer : but
marketing executive : and the most interesting tail .
project manager : is your cat , or did you find him on the street ?
industrial designer : it is supposed to be a cat . i like cats because they are independent .
project manager : that is pretty clear . everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask and go ahead . it is pretty easy . s
marketing executive : we are being haunted .
project manager : haunted white board . we have got the tool introduction . we move along to the project finance . as you can see , we for our remote control , a selling price is twenty five euros . our selling price . our profit aim is fifty million euros . that is the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . we can do it international , so we have to focus on different users , different cultures , and different trends as . but that is all in the later stadium . our production cost can be maximal twelve and a half euros , so that is also a point we have to keep in mind , that we wo not make remote controls with small televisions inside , and like that . it wo not work . just try to remember these points . selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million , but more important is the int international market we are trying to focus on . and production cost maximal twelve and a half euros . that is leads us to our little discussion . we have got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . i am gonna sit down , .
marketing executive : you got a message .
project manager : i have got a message .
user interface designer : five minutes , .
project manager : that is good timing .
marketing executive : so just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ?
project manager : maybe you have to say the magic word .
marketing executive : .
project manager : does it do anything ?
marketing executive : no .
project manager : maybe you have to just clap it down ? back up again . no slide show .
marketing executive : it is off now .
project manager : it is off . now you have to put it back o you will be , .
marketing executive : it was on , but
project manager : it is those laptops .
marketing executive : there we are .
project manager : . but so does everybody has experiences with remote controls , and not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? like you can use for other ?
user interface designer : really ?
project manager : you ?
user interface designer : it is a
industrial designer : no , me neither .
marketing executive : we have a broad t_v _ at home , and a d_v_d _ player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the t_v _ , one for the video recorder , one for the d_v_d _ player . and it is it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all .
project manager : i have got one at home . and you can program eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and it also operates on infra - red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . so that is pretty handy when you have a video recorder or d_v_d _ player downstairs and you have got a link to your t_v _ on the second floor . so that is a pretty handy
marketing executive : really .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : thing . but only the that if you can put different devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as . it is that is good to remember .
marketing executive : you can take minutes again .
project manager : that is , .
marketing executive : since it is your job .
project manager : we have we want different functions and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra - red . but i if that will exceed the production costs . so that that is something we have to find out , .
marketing executive : but that would be really good if we could do that .
project manager : and other functions for a remote control ? maybe we can make it
marketing executive : think it has to be shock proof
project manager : shock proof .
marketing executive : my remote control tends to fall a lot .
user interface designer : waterproof , you never no know , i w
project manager : waterproof . so these are our a few things we can think of . i will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder .
marketing executive : one other little thing . thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it .
project manager : that is a
marketing executive : so you can see
project manager : battery stays .
marketing executive : how much is left in the battery . but they will also really drag up the production costs , so think we will have to see about that too . but maybe just a little led , i .
project manager : that is an idea as .
industrial designer : nope . they were all mentioned , so
project manager : any questions about this presentation ? kick off presentation .
marketing executive : . nope , do not .

project manager : what are we going to do ? our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . it has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . so these are the points why we also hired you . we have got the marketing expert for the trendy and user friendly look . and industrial designer there is also user friendly and a bit original . and we have got our user interface designer . he is also that is about the new remote control . project method is there are three phases we are going through . first is functional des design , individual work , meetings . after the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design . i had some role indications on here . but it already by yourself . the industrial designer is going to work on the working design , components design and a bit of the look and feel design . the user interface designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . and the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project product ev evaluation . so that is a bit what you are going to do . but that will be all worked out in other meetings . then we have got our first tool training . we are going to work with a lot of high - tech tools here , so it is ab it is handy if we have a little bit of training first . as you can see we have got the smart boards here and here in the white board . in the white board here there is a little tool bar on this side . here are some functions . n these functions we do not have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little piece of drawing . a blank new document for each person . select a pen , eraser . capture we do not have to do anything with . then we have got our pen . it is really funny because you can draw with it on this page in the think it is form of . you can also select the current colour and the line width . but then first you have to select the pen function . but we are going to work with it in a minute . that is very simple and it is easy to draw your findings and drawings on there . then a short thing about documents . we have got our shared folder , project what was it ? project documents . but all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be . and these are available on the smart boards as , so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder . here is a simple tool bar . it is what said , it is save , print , move back or forward one page . you can switch between the different drawings . and then we are going to try out the white board . as you can see we g all going to draw a animal . just to just to get a bit familiar with it . mouse was not running away .
marketing executive : that was interesting .
project manager : is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse ?
marketing executive : innocent .
project manager : we are going to draw animal . and just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics . the only thing we have to look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . there is start from now . you can use this pen by holding it like a little child . because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing wo not get good . another thing is you have to be a bit slow . if you are going to draw like really fast then the pen wo not hold up . we choose form of current colour grey is appropriate . then the line width . seven will be . now you will see my drawing capabilities . these are not very much , but , see you have to do it real slow . i was trying to draw a dolphin , but his nose has to be a little bit but it is close .
marketing executive : i am thinking about a swordfish .
project manager : so what it is this is bit of the swordfish . he has not got an eye .
industrial designer :  .
project manager : woah . now we have got another function . we have got the eraser . and then you can undo this easily .
marketing executive : meat .
project manager : it is . and i have got to write down a few of its characteristics . is they have got no text tool , no . this is typically a undo action , . maybe you have to hold it a bit upside - down . that is it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . but i , i am just trying . this is not my work , maybe you have to use . it is a it wants to draw a another animal ? it lives for the fun . it is my characteristic about the dolphin . it lives for the fun . now i am gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you .
marketing executive : gonna use a different line width . and i am gonna draw in black . , i am not much of an artist , but here we go .
project manager : maybe it is easier to draw the smaller line width , . because this is going a lot better than i did .
user interface designer : a sheep .
marketing executive : this is my .
project manager : it is .
marketing executive : with little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts .
project manager : it is a real dead sheep , for recognition , i see . maybe you can also write your name somewhere . on just a
marketing executive : they are come on . you have to go really slow when you are writing . they are brilliant animal animals . and that is just a little me thingy . i will pass the pen to our user interface designer .
user interface designer : i am just gonna draw its head , but let is see .
project manager : sweet .
marketing executive : interesting .
user interface designer : what that is ?
industrial designer : garfield .
marketing executive : a rabbit ?
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : garfield .
user interface designer : just a so . that is enough . , you say a blank ,
project manager : just a blank sheet .
user interface designer : or
industrial designer : i was gonna draw a cat too , so . i will just try something else . something different than garfield . mine is a bit more skinny .
project manager : it is pretty skinny cat .
industrial designer : but
marketing executive : and the most interesting tail .
project manager : is your cat , or did you find him on the street ?
industrial designer : it is supposed to be a cat . i like cats because they are independent .
project manager : that is pretty clear . everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask and go ahead . it is pretty easy . s
marketing executive : we are being haunted .
project manager : haunted white board . we have got the tool introduction . we move along to the project finance . as you can see , we for our remote control , a selling price is twenty five euros . our selling price . our profit aim is fifty million euros . that is the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . we can do it international , so we have to focus on different users , different cultures , and different trends as . but that is all in the later stadium . our production cost can be maximal twelve and a half euros , so that is also a point we have to keep in mind , that we wo not make remote controls with small televisions inside , and like that . it wo not work . just try to remember these points . selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million , but more important is the int international market we are trying to focus on . and production cost maximal twelve and a half euros . that is leads us to our little discussion . we have got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . i am gonna sit down , .
marketing executive : you got a message .
project manager : i have got a message .
user interface designer : five minutes , .
project manager : that is good timing .
marketing executive : so just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ?
project manager : maybe you have to say the magic word .
marketing executive : .
project manager : does it do anything ?
marketing executive : no .
project manager : maybe you have to just clap it down ? back up again . no slide show .
marketing executive : it is off now .
project manager : it is off . now you have to put it back o you will be , .
marketing executive : it was on , but
project manager : it is those laptops .
marketing executive : there we are .
project manager : . but so does everybody has experiences with remote controls , and not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? like you can use for other ?
user interface designer : really ?
project manager : you ?
user interface designer : it is a
industrial designer : no , me neither .
marketing executive : we have a broad t_v _ at home , and a d_v_d _ player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the t_v _ , one for the video recorder , one for the d_v_d _ player . and it is it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all .
project manager : i have got one at home . and you can program eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and it also operates on infra - red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . so that is pretty handy when you have a video recorder or d_v_d _ player downstairs and you have got a link to your t_v _ on the second floor . so that is a pretty handy
marketing executive : really .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : thing . but only the that if you can put different devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as . it is that is good to remember .
marketing executive : you can take minutes again .
project manager : that is , .
marketing executive : since it is your job .
project manager : we have we want different functions and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra - red . but i if that will exceed the production costs . so that that is something we have to find out , .
marketing executive : but that would be really good if we could do that .
project manager : and other functions for a remote control ? maybe we can make it
marketing executive : think it has to be shock proof
project manager : shock proof .
marketing executive : my remote control tends to fall a lot .
user interface designer : waterproof , you never no know , i w
project manager : waterproof . so these are our a few things we can think of . i will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder .
marketing executive : one other little thing . thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it .
project manager : that is a
marketing executive : so you can see
project manager : battery stays .
marketing executive : how much is left in the battery . but they will also really drag up the production costs , so think we will have to see about that too . but maybe just a little led , i .
project manager : that is an idea as .
industrial designer : nope . they were all mentioned , so
project manager : any questions about this presentation ? kick off presentation .
marketing executive : . nope , do not .
project manager : then i will put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder , and then we can all work . finish meeting now . and we can all work on our own projects .
marketing executive : aye sir .
project manager : then i will meet you in about a half an hour , .
marketing executive : half an hour .
project manager : so good luck .","the project manager introduced himself to the team and then acquainted the team with the audio and video equipment in the meeting room . the project manager briefly described the company the team works for and discussed the corporate website . the project manager then described the upcoming project and the roles of each team member . the project manager introduced the smart boards to the team and led the team members in an exercise in which they each drew their favorite animal and described why they liked the animal . the project manager briefed the team on the project budget and selling prices for the remote they are to create and led them in a discussion on their experiences with remote controls and what features they would like to include in their product . the team members will work on their individual projects the selling price will be 25 euro . the focus will be on an international market . the production cost cannot exceed 12.50 euro . the remote will be able to control multiple devices . the remote will be shockproof . the remote will be waterproof . cost of a battery status display .
","the project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then the team members participated in a tool training exercise to familiarize themselves with high-tech tools and their roles in the project . the team then participated in individual work on the functional , conceptual , and detailed design of the remote . after the tool training , the team participated in an exercise in which they each drew their favorite animals , used the smart board to record their actions and used the eraser function to erase their own drawings . they then used the marketing expert to evaluate the remote as being original , trendy , original and user-friendly . na spongy remote which is made of plastic . it was decided that the remote would not include a lcd screen . there was a discussion on the remote's look and feel , but it was not clear what the team was aiming for the remote to be aesthetically pleasing .",,,,x,x,x,x,x,1.0,T5-Baseline
30,"project manager : everybody found his place again ?
marketing executive : yes .
project manager : that is . so this is our second meeting . and still failing ? now we are going into the functional design . important thing of this phase is that we are going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . so that we can move onto the second phase . but first this phase . first an announcement . there is a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . so there is our ghost mouse again . that that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , that is because of this it is in wing c _ and e _ . it should be over in a while , couple of days . but it is going to be cold anyway , so i do not think you are gonna need it .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : then our agenda . now first the opening . this time i will take the minutes . you are going to have a presentation . and we have got forty minutes for the whole prese for the whole presentations . so i suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements which have been sent to me . and then the decision on the control functions which we wanna include and those which we do not wanna include . we have got forty minutes for all of it . i suggest let is start with the first presentation . who wants to be first ?
marketing executive : think i will go first .
project manager : just maybe it is easier if you will tell your presentation as . just which function you have and what you are gonna talk about .
marketing executive : my name is freek van ponnen . i am the market expert . but you already knew that . i have done some research . we have we have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls . we let them fill out a questionnaire . we had one hundred of these test subjects . in addition we did some market research . see what the market consists of . what ages are involved . these are three quite astonishing results , . remotes are being considered ugly . f seventy five percent of the people questioned indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy - looking remote control . so in addition remotes were not very functional . fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . and fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . then we did some research to the most relevant functions . channel selection and volume selection both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . the power button got a nine . and teletext got a six and a half . so these are the most important functions on a remote control . then there are some one - time use function . that is what i like to call them . that audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . then these are the this is the market . sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . main characteristic of this group is that they are very critical on the remote control . they like to use new f new functions . but they also are very critical . they wo not spend their money very easily . the users of forty six to sixty five years cons the make up forty percent of the market . they are not really very interested in features . but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . what this indicates for our design . we should make a remote for the future . and this means we would have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . the results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused r_s _ r_s_i _ . this is certainly something to take into account . and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . so these are two factors that should be included in the design . besides that the remote must look very . and the functionality as a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , we should make very few buttons . this will also be beneficial to the design of the remote . the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons . they are used most and so they should be robust . they should not break down easily . then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room , it might be and i say might be because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot . but it might be a good idea to make a docking station . and this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . so you would know where it is in the room . and in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . then a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that an l_c_d _ screen in the remote control would be preferred . this was mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . but up till forty five it remains feasible . this would also greatly increase the production costs but these are just some small factors we could consider . that would be all .
project manager : anybody have any questions until now ?
marketing executive : any questions ?
project manager : about functional requirements ?
user interface designer :  .
industrial designer : no .
project manager : that is clear . now to the second .
user interface designer : i have been looking at the user interface of it . f for the techno f functions of it .
project manager : you can take your time . we have got plenty of time ,
user interface designer : ?
marketing executive : you should go to the top thingy .
project manager : .
user interface designer : we must use the general functions of the remote control . i have do i have done a little research on the internet and not much information about it , about interface but i have been thinking about a simple manner to put a lot of functions in one remote control . so you have got a lot of devi devices like d_v_d _ television , stereo . so but it must be user - friendly . you c you ca not put a lot of functions in one . in one remote control .
project manager : one remote .
user interface designer : but got many functions in one remote control , you can see , this is quite simple remote control . few buttons but this re remote control got a lot of buttons . people do not like it , so what i was thinking about was keep the general functions like they are . like the on - off button . keep it l like a red button . everybody knows it so you do not have to change that . my personal preferences . use a display for specific functions of the different device . wh what i was th thinking about was you have got this the remote control and you got here the general functions , like the on - off button sound and here you have got a s a display . it is a touchscreen . you got a general f the functions of the device for a d_v_d _ player or so the pl f for playing reverse . and you got here real buttons for selecting a device . this button is for a d_v_d _ or for every device you have got a f a b a part display of a part buttons . you never got all the buttons on w one device . that is my idea about it . and let is see . so a touchscreen . and th the buttons the real buttons we have to use . we better c use quite large buttons for everybody have to use it so ol even old people young people . we must keep buttons quite s simple and quite large . that was my part of it .
project manager : anybody has questions about the technical functions ?
industrial designer : if we are gonna use a touchscreen we are gonna go way above the twelve and a half euros .
user interface designer : n i do not . you got quite a cheap touchscreen . s it is not in colour .
project manager : touchscreen .
user interface designer : it is just one colo i seen w something on the internet not today but a few weeks ago . you got quite an a touchscreen and it is for twenty euros or less . so it is possible .
project manager : .
marketing executive : it would certainly make a fancy design .
industrial designer : but the it would not be very robust . it is very fragile and you can get scratches on it .
marketing executive : that is true .
user interface designer : that is true .
project manager : maybe we can first listen to your presentation ?
marketing executive : we would have to look into that .
project manager : and then we have a little discussion about the requirements and design .
industrial designer : that is .
project manager : it is going to it is not too much .
industrial designer : i have got a presentation about the working design . first about how it works . it is really simple . everybody knows how a remote works . the user presses a button . the remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the t_v _ . the t_v _ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . so we have got the plate . it gots conductive disks for every button . when the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the led and transmits tranmi transmits its to the t_v _ . it is a very simple device , technically speaking . this is a schematic overview . you have got the buttons . the power source . and when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . the chip controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . when you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . we should use default materials , simple plastics . keep the inner workings simple , so it is robust . we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you are going to use high - tech materials the price is going to go sky - high . and you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high - tech materials it come back in every product . it is , in my idea , it is gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in the product itself .
project manager : now i hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . i am the project manager so i am here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements . that is , we have got to design a remote which is only suitable for t_v _ . that is because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it for more functions . so it has to be simple . another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be a thing of the past . and it is a function we do not need in our remote control . internet is also mentioned in a function we can use . maybe also on televisions it will be available as . another one is the customer is forty plus . that is the market we have to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . this is a bit pity for the marketing expert . because he was aiming on the younger persons . so we have to find a market which is above forty plus but which will suit our remote control , and the other way round . and we have to be very attent in putting the corporate image in our product . so it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . and we have to be very clear on this point as . i suggest let is have a discussion on the control functions .
marketing executive : is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ?
project manager : we can see if we can find a way between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product .
marketing executive : you are saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it is not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . and new t_v_s will have internet access on them . but if you are targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a t_v _ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim . in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . so it is pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . i am against it .
project manager : against the no teletext ?
marketing executive : besides that , the market for forty plus is like pretty small . but if i s if i see this , it is we are just gonna go for another
project manager : it is it is
user interface designer : forty
project manager : standard remote .
marketing executive : pretty
project manager : no we can
marketing executive : and not innovative
project manager : we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons
marketing executive : remote control .
project manager : which were also mentioned . if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons . or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market . if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it is the biggest share of the whole population now .
marketing executive : yes but it is not the biggest part of the market .
project manager : no .
marketing executive : and besides that , they are not very critical so they do not really care what the remote control is like . they will just take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable .
project manager : but do not you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market , that people think the people think that is the device i have looked for although i did not realise it . let is try it .
marketing executive : that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . because they are critical and they want to have a fancy remote control . people of forty plus , they want it to work , but as soo as soon as it works it is with them .
industrial designer : that if we are if we put our marketing right we can sell this just like i if you have heard about it in the news , the elderly mobile phone ?
project manager : it is a big success .
industrial designer : if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , .
project manager : very big success .
marketing executive : i have not heard of it .
project manager : .
industrial designer : we do not have to focus on the design then but on functionality . we just change our focus on the project , and we can sell this .
project manager : i simply think that the new products we are gonna make , spef specifically design , are designed for younger people , so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . and we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls . what you told is the channel selection is important . volume selection , power and teletext .
marketing executive : but the board tends to disagree .
project manager : we have not voted yet , teletext can be a function as . but only if it wo not higher the cost , because i if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as , but i do not think it will be a problem . or is teletext a
user interface designer : but deaf people need teletext for subtitles . so it is
marketing executive : also .
project manager : i suggest
marketing executive : it would definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext .
user interface designer : it is
project manager : is anybody really against teletext ? just that , that we just keep the teletext . that is a good idea as , especially for the subtitles . maybe we can make that another point of advantage in our remote control , if we make a k a button ex for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . for elderly people they can think , i wanna have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles .
industrial designer : that is a good idea .
project manager : teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . functionality should be few buttons , you said . that is very important we have a few buttons .
marketing executive :  .
project manager : so to keep it simple .
marketing executive : but i do not think that is really an issue any more might be .
user interface designer : if it is only for televi
marketing executive : but it , if it is only for t_v _ you are not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway . you need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel , volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but
project manager : but do you need
user interface designer : so we can s we can skip the display ,
marketing executive : if you only l
user interface designer : so we do not need it .
project manager : but do you need the buttons for one to zero .
marketing executive : nah .
project manager : maybe c we can
marketing executive : think if you are gonna include teletext you do . many people like to use that .
project manager : maybe we can use
marketing executive : if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you do not wanna push the next channel button thirty five times .
project manager : no , maybe we can implement the scroll button ? or a joystick like ? there are other ways too . just look if you look at telephones . the sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or
marketing executive : that is true but i do not think there are many t_v_s that can switch channels that fast . and so you would need like the t_v _ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . and if many channels would do have that . if many t_v_s have that .
industrial designer : and besides that it is if we are gonna focus on elderly people they will have to adapt . they are not used to using scroll buttons . so perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout .
project manager : the numbers . they can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display , and if it is too much we can reconsider it . but there wo not be very much buttons . or there do not have to be a lot .
marketing executive : but i do not think if you are gonna make a remote control only to operate a t_v _ , you there is not much you can gain on having as few buttons as possible . there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a t_v _ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . i do not think there is much to be gained in that area .
project manager : the number of buttons ? it is very important in the design . you can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places . and if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with
marketing executive : that is true but there is simply not much to gain on the competition when you are making a remote control only for to operate only the t_v _ .
project manager : to operate only the t_v _ .
marketing executive : if you have a remote control only to operate a t_v _ there is simply not a lot of buttons required . there is not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply do not have a lot of buttons either .
user interface designer : no .
project manager : so .
marketing executive : it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here . that would that would cost a big marketing expedition
project manager : .
marketing executive : which was one of the arguments to make it only for the t_v _ because we did not have the time to market a lot .
project manager : you suggest we could better focus on the docking station . like other functions . instead of f of less buttons .
marketing executive : maybe . , mean we need a good way to position all the buttons and but i do not think we should spend very much time in that .
project manager : . do you think the docking station will is allowed in the budget we have ?
industrial designer : it should be possible yes . if it is not too fancy .
project manager : it can be
industrial designer : and if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible
project manager : because that is that is a good advantage point as . if we have a fancy - looking docking station
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : or very that is a requirement . docking station .
industrial designer : we are just gonna focus on the extras ?
project manager : so .
marketing executive : maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a like to have extra in a new remote control .
project manager : that is a good point . you said they easily get lost as .
marketing executive : fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost .
project manager : so maybe we should implement the audio sign , .
marketing executive : that was what i suggested .
industrial designer : like with your key - chain , if you whistle it goes it makes a sound .
marketing executive : you have it on
user interface designer : hm .
marketing executive : you have it is on some phones too , which have a docking station . and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing .
project manager : . so
marketing executive : so where it is .
project manager : audio signal should be possible as . it is not too expensive . another point is the l_c_d _ screen . i if that will rise the cost too much , because
industrial designer : y i we will have to choose between the docking station or the screen ,
project manager : it will be too much as .
industrial designer : it is
marketing executive : since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we are focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . which would tell you what it does . and it would not have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen ,
project manager : based . just the l_c_d _ . just the normal screen .
marketing executive : just a small screen
project manager : that is a good idea .
marketing executive : with two
project manager : some extra info . that is a good idea as .
marketing executive : but if that would
project manager : as the small screen .
marketing executive : that would fit into the costs .
project manager : extra button info . that should be possible as . let is see what did we say . should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . few buttons , we talked about that . docking station , l_c_d _ . general functions and default materials . that is a good idea as , because elderly people do not mind if it is a titanium cover or just a plastic one . so that does not really matter . we nee
marketing executive : probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters .
project manager : let is specify the target group . because are we talking about elderly people or people from forty to eighty . because what we are going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . what do we want ? if we want a with the telephone for elderly people , we can target the real elderly people .
marketing executive : that would be a if we should do something like that it would be a , it would be really good for the image of the company . and , there would be a good market for it .
project manager : that is the
marketing executive : if we are able to really bring an innovative product .
project manager : now you are talking about sixty to eighty .
marketing executive : the really
project manager : sixty .
marketing executive : but i would have to look into that a little more .
project manager : and different cultures . are we
industrial designer : i do not think they have different television sets in every country .
project manager : we have got five minutes left just now . small warning .
marketing executive : and with the little screen in it , which explains the buttons . you could we n it would be a lot easier to
project manager : should
marketing executive : adapt it to different cultures .
project manager : in different languages , . or you have to put a language button in it ,
user interface designer : right .
project manager : but that will be a bit unnecessary .
user interface designer : no .
project manager : it is better to put it on different markets with it all . that is the target . then a few small things . i will put the minutes in the project document folder . what we are going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept , user interface designer the user interface concept , and the trend - watching . just keep in mind the things we have said about the target group , requirements , and the trends which are going on . and specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach . i for this meeting . and we have a lunch - break now .
marketing executive : that is good .
project manager : that is a good thing .","the project manager stated the agenda and the marketing expert discussed what functions are most relevant on a remote , what the target demographic is , and what his vision for the appearance of the remote is . the marketing expert also brought up the idea to include a docking station to prevent the remote from getting lost and the idea to include an lcd screen . the user interface designer pushed for a user-friendly interface with large buttons , a display function , a touchscreen , and the capability of controlling different devices . the industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the project manager briefed the team on some new requirements they are to abide by . the team then discussed teletext , the target demographic , the buttons the remote should have , the idea of marketing a remote designed for the elderly , an audio signal which can sound if the remote is lost , lcd screens , and language options . the industrial designer will work on the components concept . the user interface designer will work on the user interface concept and trend-watching the remote will only be used for televisions . the user target group consists of adults age sixty to eighty . the corporate image must be visible in the design of the remote . the team will implement teletext in their design if it does not cost too much . the remote will only have a few buttons . the remote will have a docking station . the remote will have an audio signal to allow users to locate it when misplaced-the team will focus on creating a remote for elderly people . the remote will feature a small lcd screen . the remote will be fancy . the remote will be easy to learn . the remote will be made to accommodate different languages . cost of a touchscreen . whether to include teletext in the design despite the new requirement which indicates that the team is not to work with teletext . the user target group of adults age forty and up is quite small . what buttons and functions to include on the remote . whether to include a scroll button . whether to focus more on the layout of the buttons or the docking station .
","the marketing expert presented research on user requirements and user tendencies with remote controls . the research indicated that users between the ages of 16 and 45 want a fancier , more functional , easier-to-use remote , and tend to be critical of ugly or poorly designed remotes . he also indicated that younger users are interested in more advanced functions , while users between 46 and 55 don't tend to use many buttons . in order to meet the profit goals of the project , the team had to consider including a lock function and a menu that would if the remote should have a programmable ""fa"" function to access; it was decided that there would be only for the if it should be useful or not to use . after the project manager announced that they would have to work together on the technical functions . they discussed how to find a remote when misplaced and when lost . there will be no longer be a discussion about the cost of components and the remote but it is unlikely that they will be able to include many of the company colors and logo on the remote . this will be used only for televisions , so that it could be used with the company colours and logo , but not necessarily be incorporated into the design of the device . when it becomes evident from the manager's new requirements , they would be unable to find the location of their location when they get lost , or when they found the remote when it is misplace",x,,,,,,,,6.0,T5-Cons

marketing executive : yes .
project manager : that is . so this is our second meeting . and still failing ? now we are going into the functional design . important thing of this phase is that we are going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . so that we can move onto the second phase . but first this phase . first an announcement . there is a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . so there is our ghost mouse again . that that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , that is because of this it is in wing c _ and e _ . it should be over in a while , couple of days . but it is going to be cold anyway , so i do not think you are gonna need it .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : then our agenda . now first the opening . this time i will take the minutes . you are going to have a presentation . and we have got forty minutes for the whole prese for the whole presentations . so i suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements which have been sent to me . and then the decision on the control functions which we wanna include and those which we do not wanna include . we have got forty minutes for all of it . i suggest let is start with the first presentation . who wants to be first ?
marketing executive : think i will go first .
project manager : just maybe it is easier if you will tell your presentation as . just which function you have and what you are gonna talk about .
marketing executive : my name is freek van ponnen . i am the market expert . but you already knew that . i have done some research . we have we have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls . we let them fill out a questionnaire . we had one hundred of these test subjects . in addition we did some market research . see what the market consists of . what ages are involved . these are three quite astonishing results , . remotes are being considered ugly . f seventy five percent of the people questioned indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy - looking remote control . so in addition remotes were not very functional . fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . and fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . then we did some research to the most relevant functions . channel selection and volume selection both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . the power button got a nine . and teletext got a six and a half . so these are the most important functions on a remote control . then there are some one - time use function . that is what i like to call them . that audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . then these are the this is the market . sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . main characteristic of this group is that they are very critical on the remote control . they like to use new f new functions . but they also are very critical . they wo not spend their money very easily . the users of forty six to sixty five years cons the make up forty percent of the market . they are not really very interested in features . but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . what this indicates for our design . we should make a remote for the future . and this means we would have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . the results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused r_s _ r_s_i _ . this is certainly something to take into account . and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . so these are two factors that should be included in the design . besides that the remote must look very . and the functionality as a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , we should make very few buttons . this will also be beneficial to the design of the remote . the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons . they are used most and so they should be robust . they should not break down easily . then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room , it might be and i say might be because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot . but it might be a good idea to make a docking station . and this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . so you would know where it is in the room . and in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . then a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that an l_c_d _ screen in the remote control would be preferred . this was mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . but up till forty five it remains feasible . this would also greatly increase the production costs but these are just some small factors we could consider . that would be all .
project manager : anybody have any questions until now ?
marketing executive : any questions ?
project manager : about functional requirements ?
user interface designer :  .
industrial designer : no .
project manager : that is clear . now to the second .
user interface designer : i have been looking at the user interface of it . f for the techno f functions of it .
project manager : you can take your time . we have got plenty of time ,
user interface designer : ?
marketing executive : you should go to the top thingy .
project manager : .
user interface designer : we must use the general functions of the remote control . i have do i have done a little research on the internet and not much information about it , about interface but i have been thinking about a simple manner to put a lot of functions in one remote control . so you have got a lot of devi devices like d_v_d _ television , stereo . so but it must be user - friendly . you c you ca not put a lot of functions in one . in one remote control .
project manager : one remote .
user interface designer : but got many functions in one remote control , you can see , this is quite simple remote control . few buttons but this re remote control got a lot of buttons . people do not like it , so what i was thinking about was keep the general functions like they are . like the on - off button . keep it l like a red button . everybody knows it so you do not have to change that . my personal preferences . use a display for specific functions of the different device . wh what i was th thinking about was you have got this the remote control and you got here the general functions , like the on - off button sound and here you have got a s a display . it is a touchscreen . you got a general f the functions of the device for a d_v_d _ player or so the pl f for playing reverse . and you got here real buttons for selecting a device . this button is for a d_v_d _ or for every device you have got a f a b a part display of a part buttons . you never got all the buttons on w one device . that is my idea about it . and let is see . so a touchscreen . and th the buttons the real buttons we have to use . we better c use quite large buttons for everybody have to use it so ol even old people young people . we must keep buttons quite s simple and quite large . that was my part of it .
project manager : anybody has questions about the technical functions ?
industrial designer : if we are gonna use a touchscreen we are gonna go way above the twelve and a half euros .
user interface designer : n i do not . you got quite a cheap touchscreen . s it is not in colour .
project manager : touchscreen .
user interface designer : it is just one colo i seen w something on the internet not today but a few weeks ago . you got quite an a touchscreen and it is for twenty euros or less . so it is possible .
project manager : .
marketing executive : it would certainly make a fancy design .
industrial designer : but the it would not be very robust . it is very fragile and you can get scratches on it .
marketing executive : that is true .
user interface designer : that is true .
project manager : maybe we can first listen to your presentation ?
marketing executive : we would have to look into that .
project manager : and then we have a little discussion about the requirements and design .
industrial designer : that is .
project manager : it is going to it is not too much .
industrial designer : i have got a presentation about the working design . first about how it works . it is really simple . everybody knows how a remote works . the user presses a button . the remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the t_v _ . the t_v _ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . so we have got the plate . it gots conductive disks for every button . when the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the led and transmits tranmi transmits its to the t_v _ . it is a very simple device , technically speaking . this is a schematic overview . you have got the buttons . the power source . and when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . the chip controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . when you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . we should use default materials , simple plastics . keep the inner workings simple , so it is robust . we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you are going to use high - tech materials the price is going to go sky - high . and you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high - tech materials it come back in every product . it is , in my idea , it is gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in the product itself .
project manager : now i hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . i am the project manager so i am here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements . that is , we have got to design a remote which is only suitable for t_v _ . that is because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it for more functions . so it has to be simple . another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be a thing of the past . and it is a function we do not need in our remote control . internet is also mentioned in a function we can use . maybe also on televisions it will be available as . another one is the customer is forty plus . that is the market we have to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . this is a bit pity for the marketing expert . because he was aiming on the younger persons . so we have to find a market which is above forty plus but which will suit our remote control , and the other way round . and we have to be very attent in putting the corporate image in our product . so it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . and we have to be very clear on this point as . i suggest let is have a discussion on the control functions .
marketing executive : is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ?
project manager : we can see if we can find a way between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product .
marketing executive : you are saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it is not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . and new t_v_s will have internet access on them . but if you are targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a t_v _ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim . in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . so it is pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . i am against it .
project manager : against the no teletext ?
marketing executive : besides that , the market for forty plus is like pretty small . but if i s if i see this , it is we are just gonna go for another
project manager : it is it is
user interface designer : forty
project manager : standard remote .
marketing executive : pretty
project manager : no we can
marketing executive : and not innovative
project manager : we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons
marketing executive : remote control .
project manager : which were also mentioned . if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons . or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market . if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it is the biggest share of the whole population now .
marketing executive : yes but it is not the biggest part of the market .
project manager : no .
marketing executive : and besides that , they are not very critical so they do not really care what the remote control is like . they will just take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable .
project manager : but do not you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market , that people think the people think that is the device i have looked for although i did not realise it . let is try it .
marketing executive : that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . because they are critical and they want to have a fancy remote control . people of forty plus , they want it to work , but as soo as soon as it works it is with them .
industrial designer : that if we are if we put our marketing right we can sell this just like i if you have heard about it in the news , the elderly mobile phone ?
project manager : it is a big success .
industrial designer : if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , .
project manager : very big success .
marketing executive : i have not heard of it .
project manager : .
industrial designer : we do not have to focus on the design then but on functionality . we just change our focus on the project , and we can sell this .
project manager : i simply think that the new products we are gonna make , spef specifically design , are designed for younger people , so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . and we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls . what you told is the channel selection is important . volume selection , power and teletext .
marketing executive : but the board tends to disagree .
project manager : we have not voted yet , teletext can be a function as . but only if it wo not higher the cost , because i if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as , but i do not think it will be a problem . or is teletext a
user interface designer : but deaf people need teletext for subtitles . so it is
marketing executive : also .
project manager : i suggest
marketing executive : it would definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext .
user interface designer : it is
project manager : is anybody really against teletext ? just that , that we just keep the teletext . that is a good idea as , especially for the subtitles . maybe we can make that another point of advantage in our remote control , if we make a k a button ex for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . for elderly people they can think , i wanna have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles .
industrial designer : that is a good idea .
project manager : teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . functionality should be few buttons , you said . that is very important we have a few buttons .
marketing executive :  .
project manager : so to keep it simple .
marketing executive : but i do not think that is really an issue any more might be .
user interface designer : if it is only for televi
marketing executive : but it , if it is only for t_v _ you are not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway . you need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel , volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but
project manager : but do you need
user interface designer : so we can s we can skip the display ,
marketing executive : if you only l
user interface designer : so we do not need it .
project manager : but do you need the buttons for one to zero .
marketing executive : nah .
project manager : maybe c we can
marketing executive : think if you are gonna include teletext you do . many people like to use that .
project manager : maybe we can use
marketing executive : if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you do not wanna push the next channel button thirty five times .
project manager : no , maybe we can implement the scroll button ? or a joystick like ? there are other ways too . just look if you look at telephones . the sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or
marketing executive : that is true but i do not think there are many t_v_s that can switch channels that fast . and so you would need like the t_v _ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . and if many channels would do have that . if many t_v_s have that .
industrial designer : and besides that it is if we are gonna focus on elderly people they will have to adapt . they are not used to using scroll buttons . so perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout .
project manager : the numbers . they can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display , and if it is too much we can reconsider it . but there wo not be very much buttons . or there do not have to be a lot .
marketing executive : but i do not think if you are gonna make a remote control only to operate a t_v _ , you there is not much you can gain on having as few buttons as possible . there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a t_v _ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . i do not think there is much to be gained in that area .
project manager : the number of buttons ? it is very important in the design . you can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places . and if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with
marketing executive : that is true but there is simply not much to gain on the competition when you are making a remote control only for to operate only the t_v _ .
project manager : to operate only the t_v _ .
marketing executive : if you have a remote control only to operate a t_v _ there is simply not a lot of buttons required . there is not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply do not have a lot of buttons either .
user interface designer : no .
project manager : so .
marketing executive : it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here . that would that would cost a big marketing expedition
project manager : .
marketing executive : which was one of the arguments to make it only for the t_v _ because we did not have the time to market a lot .
project manager : you suggest we could better focus on the docking station . like other functions . instead of f of less buttons .
marketing executive : maybe . , mean we need a good way to position all the buttons and but i do not think we should spend very much time in that .
project manager : . do you think the docking station will is allowed in the budget we have ?
industrial designer : it should be possible yes . if it is not too fancy .
project manager : it can be
industrial designer : and if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible
project manager : because that is that is a good advantage point as . if we have a fancy - looking docking station
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : or very that is a requirement . docking station .
industrial designer : we are just gonna focus on the extras ?
project manager : so .
marketing executive : maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a like to have extra in a new remote control .
project manager : that is a good point . you said they easily get lost as .
marketing executive : fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost .
project manager : so maybe we should implement the audio sign , .
marketing executive : that was what i suggested .
industrial designer : like with your key - chain , if you whistle it goes it makes a sound .
marketing executive : you have it on
user interface designer : hm .
marketing executive : you have it is on some phones too , which have a docking station . and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing .
project manager : . so
marketing executive : so where it is .
project manager : audio signal should be possible as . it is not too expensive . another point is the l_c_d _ screen . i if that will rise the cost too much , because
industrial designer : y i we will have to choose between the docking station or the screen ,
project manager : it will be too much as .
industrial designer : it is
marketing executive : since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we are focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . which would tell you what it does . and it would not have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen ,
project manager : based . just the l_c_d _ . just the normal screen .
marketing executive : just a small screen
project manager : that is a good idea .
marketing executive : with two
project manager : some extra info . that is a good idea as .
marketing executive : but if that would
project manager : as the small screen .
marketing executive : that would fit into the costs .
project manager : extra button info . that should be possible as . let is see what did we say . should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . few buttons , we talked about that . docking station , l_c_d _ . general functions and default materials . that is a good idea as , because elderly people do not mind if it is a titanium cover or just a plastic one . so that does not really matter . we nee
marketing executive : probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters .
project manager : let is specify the target group . because are we talking about elderly people or people from forty to eighty . because what we are going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . what do we want ? if we want a with the telephone for elderly people , we can target the real elderly people .
marketing executive : that would be a if we should do something like that it would be a , it would be really good for the image of the company . and , there would be a good market for it .

marketing executive : my name is freek van ponnen . i am the market expert . but you already knew that . i have done some research . we have we have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls . we let them fill out a questionnaire . we had one hundred of these test subjects . in addition we did some market research . see what the market consists of . what ages are involved . these are three quite astonishing results , . remotes are being considered ugly . f seventy five percent of the people questioned indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy - looking remote control . so in addition remotes were not very functional . fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . and fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . then we did some research to the most relevant functions . channel selection and volume selection both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . the power button got a nine . and teletext got a six and a half . so these are the most important functions on a remote control . then there are some one - time use function . that is what i like to call them . that audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . then these are the this is the market . sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . main characteristic of this group is that they are very critical on the remote control . they like to use new f new functions . but they also are very critical . they wo not spend their money very easily . the users of forty six to sixty five years cons the make up forty percent of the market . they are not really very interested in features . but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . what this indicates for our design . we should make a remote for the future . and this means we would have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . the results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused r_s _ r_s_i _ . this is certainly something to take into account . and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . so these are two factors that should be included in the design . besides that the remote must look very . and the functionality as a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , we should make very few buttons . this will also be beneficial to the design of the remote . the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons . they are used most and so they should be robust . they should not break down easily . then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room , it might be and i say might be because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot . but it might be a good idea to make a docking station . and this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . so you would know where it is in the room . and in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . then a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that an l_c_d _ screen in the remote control would be preferred . this was mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . but up till forty five it remains feasible . this would also greatly increase the production costs but these are just some small factors we could consider . that would be all .
project manager : anybody have any questions until now ?
marketing executive : any questions ?
project manager : about functional requirements ?
user interface designer :  .
industrial designer : no .
project manager : that is clear . now to the second .
user interface designer : i have been looking at the user interface of it . f for the techno f functions of it .
project manager : you can take your time . we have got plenty of time ,
user interface designer : ?
marketing executive : you should go to the top thingy .
project manager : .
user interface designer : we must use the general functions of the remote control . i have do i have done a little research on the internet and not much information about it , about interface but i have been thinking about a simple manner to put a lot of functions in one remote control . so you have got a lot of devi devices like d_v_d _ television , stereo . so but it must be user - friendly . you c you ca not put a lot of functions in one . in one remote control .
project manager : one remote .
user interface designer : but got many functions in one remote control , you can see , this is quite simple remote control . few buttons but this re remote control got a lot of buttons . people do not like it , so what i was thinking about was keep the general functions like they are . like the on - off button . keep it l like a red button . everybody knows it so you do not have to change that . my personal preferences . use a display for specific functions of the different device . wh what i was th thinking about was you have got this the remote control and you got here the general functions , like the on - off button sound and here you have got a s a display . it is a touchscreen . you got a general f the functions of the device for a d_v_d _ player or so the pl f for playing reverse . and you got here real buttons for selecting a device . this button is for a d_v_d _ or for every device you have got a f a b a part display of a part buttons . you never got all the buttons on w one device . that is my idea about it . and let is see . so a touchscreen . and th the buttons the real buttons we have to use . we better c use quite large buttons for everybody have to use it so ol even old people young people . we must keep buttons quite s simple and quite large . that was my part of it .
project manager : anybody has questions about the technical functions ?
industrial designer : if we are gonna use a touchscreen we are gonna go way above the twelve and a half euros .
user interface designer : n i do not . you got quite a cheap touchscreen . s it is not in colour .
project manager : touchscreen .
user interface designer : it is just one colo i seen w something on the internet not today but a few weeks ago . you got quite an a touchscreen and it is for twenty euros or less . so it is possible .
project manager : .
marketing executive : it would certainly make a fancy design .
industrial designer : but the it would not be very robust . it is very fragile and you can get scratches on it .
marketing executive : that is true .
user interface designer : that is true .
project manager : maybe we can first listen to your presentation ?
marketing executive : we would have to look into that .
project manager : and then we have a little discussion about the requirements and design .
industrial designer : that is .
project manager : it is going to it is not too much .
industrial designer : i have got a presentation about the working design . first about how it works . it is really simple . everybody knows how a remote works . the user presses a button . the remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the t_v _ . the t_v _ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . so we have got the plate . it gots conductive disks for every button . when the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the led and transmits tranmi transmits its to the t_v _ . it is a very simple device , technically speaking . this is a schematic overview . you have got the buttons . the power source . and when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . the chip controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . when you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . we should use default materials , simple plastics . keep the inner workings simple , so it is robust . we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you are going to use high - tech materials the price is going to go sky - high . and you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high - tech materials it come back in every product . it is , in my idea , it is gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in the product itself .
project manager : now i hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . i am the project manager so i am here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements . that is , we have got to design a remote which is only suitable for t_v _ . that is because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it for more functions . so it has to be simple . another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be a thing of the past . and it is a function we do not need in our remote control . internet is also mentioned in a function we can use . maybe also on televisions it will be available as . another one is the customer is forty plus . that is the market we have to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . this is a bit pity for the marketing expert . because he was aiming on the younger persons . so we have to find a market which is above forty plus but which will suit our remote control , and the other way round . and we have to be very attent in putting the corporate image in our product . so it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . and we have to be very clear on this point as . i suggest let is have a discussion on the control functions .
marketing executive : is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ?
project manager : we can see if we can find a way between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product .
marketing executive : you are saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it is not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . and new t_v_s will have internet access on them . but if you are targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a t_v _ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim . in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . so it is pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . i am against it .
project manager : against the no teletext ?
marketing executive : besides that , the market for forty plus is like pretty small . but if i s if i see this , it is we are just gonna go for another
project manager : it is it is
user interface designer : forty
project manager : standard remote .
marketing executive : pretty
project manager : no we can
marketing executive : and not innovative
project manager : we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons
marketing executive : remote control .
project manager : which were also mentioned . if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons . or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market . if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it is the biggest share of the whole population now .
marketing executive : yes but it is not the biggest part of the market .
project manager : no .
marketing executive : and besides that , they are not very critical so they do not really care what the remote control is like . they will just take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable .
project manager : but do not you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market , that people think the people think that is the device i have looked for although i did not realise it . let is try it .
marketing executive : that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . because they are critical and they want to have a fancy remote control . people of forty plus , they want it to work , but as soo as soon as it works it is with them .
industrial designer : that if we are if we put our marketing right we can sell this just like i if you have heard about it in the news , the elderly mobile phone ?
project manager : it is a big success .
industrial designer : if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , .
project manager : very big success .
marketing executive : i have not heard of it .
project manager : .
industrial designer : we do not have to focus on the design then but on functionality . we just change our focus on the project , and we can sell this .
project manager : i simply think that the new products we are gonna make , spef specifically design , are designed for younger people , so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . and we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls . what you told is the channel selection is important . volume selection , power and teletext .
marketing executive : but the board tends to disagree .
project manager : we have not voted yet , teletext can be a function as . but only if it wo not higher the cost , because i if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as , but i do not think it will be a problem . or is teletext a
user interface designer : but deaf people need teletext for subtitles . so it is
marketing executive : also .
project manager : i suggest
marketing executive : it would definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext .
user interface designer : it is
project manager : is anybody really against teletext ? just that , that we just keep the teletext . that is a good idea as , especially for the subtitles . maybe we can make that another point of advantage in our remote control , if we make a k a button ex for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . for elderly people they can think , i wanna have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles .
industrial designer : that is a good idea .
project manager : teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . functionality should be few buttons , you said . that is very important we have a few buttons .
marketing executive :  .
project manager : so to keep it simple .
marketing executive : but i do not think that is really an issue any more might be .
user interface designer : if it is only for televi
marketing executive : but it , if it is only for t_v _ you are not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway . you need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel , volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but
project manager : but do you need
user interface designer : so we can s we can skip the display ,
marketing executive : if you only l
user interface designer : so we do not need it .
project manager : but do you need the buttons for one to zero .
marketing executive : nah .
project manager : maybe c we can
marketing executive : think if you are gonna include teletext you do . many people like to use that .
project manager : maybe we can use
marketing executive : if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you do not wanna push the next channel button thirty five times .
project manager : no , maybe we can implement the scroll button ? or a joystick like ? there are other ways too . just look if you look at telephones . the sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or
marketing executive : that is true but i do not think there are many t_v_s that can switch channels that fast . and so you would need like the t_v _ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . and if many channels would do have that . if many t_v_s have that .
industrial designer : and besides that it is if we are gonna focus on elderly people they will have to adapt . they are not used to using scroll buttons . so perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout .
project manager : the numbers . they can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display , and if it is too much we can reconsider it . but there wo not be very much buttons . or there do not have to be a lot .
marketing executive : but i do not think if you are gonna make a remote control only to operate a t_v _ , you there is not much you can gain on having as few buttons as possible . there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a t_v _ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . i do not think there is much to be gained in that area .
project manager : the number of buttons ? it is very important in the design . you can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places . and if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with
marketing executive : that is true but there is simply not much to gain on the competition when you are making a remote control only for to operate only the t_v _ .
project manager : to operate only the t_v _ .
marketing executive : if you have a remote control only to operate a t_v _ there is simply not a lot of buttons required . there is not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply do not have a lot of buttons either .
user interface designer : no .
project manager : so .
marketing executive : it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here . that would that would cost a big marketing expedition
project manager : .
marketing executive : which was one of the arguments to make it only for the t_v _ because we did not have the time to market a lot .
project manager : you suggest we could better focus on the docking station . like other functions . instead of f of less buttons .
marketing executive : maybe . , mean we need a good way to position all the buttons and but i do not think we should spend very much time in that .
project manager : . do you think the docking station will is allowed in the budget we have ?
industrial designer : it should be possible yes . if it is not too fancy .
project manager : it can be
industrial designer : and if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible
project manager : because that is that is a good advantage point as . if we have a fancy - looking docking station
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : or very that is a requirement . docking station .
industrial designer : we are just gonna focus on the extras ?
project manager : so .
marketing executive : maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a like to have extra in a new remote control .
project manager : that is a good point . you said they easily get lost as .
marketing executive : fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost .
project manager : so maybe we should implement the audio sign , .
marketing executive : that was what i suggested .
industrial designer : like with your key - chain , if you whistle it goes it makes a sound .
marketing executive : you have it on
user interface designer : hm .
marketing executive : you have it is on some phones too , which have a docking station . and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing .
project manager : . so
marketing executive : so where it is .
project manager : audio signal should be possible as . it is not too expensive . another point is the l_c_d _ screen . i if that will rise the cost too much , because
industrial designer : y i we will have to choose between the docking station or the screen ,
project manager : it will be too much as .
industrial designer : it is
marketing executive : since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we are focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . which would tell you what it does . and it would not have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen ,
project manager : based . just the l_c_d _ . just the normal screen .
marketing executive : just a small screen
project manager : that is a good idea .
marketing executive : with two
project manager : some extra info . that is a good idea as .
marketing executive : but if that would
project manager : as the small screen .
marketing executive : that would fit into the costs .
project manager : extra button info . that should be possible as . let is see what did we say . should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . few buttons , we talked about that . docking station , l_c_d _ . general functions and default materials . that is a good idea as , because elderly people do not mind if it is a titanium cover or just a plastic one . so that does not really matter . we nee
marketing executive : probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters .
project manager : let is specify the target group . because are we talking about elderly people or people from forty to eighty . because what we are going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . what do we want ? if we want a with the telephone for elderly people , we can target the real elderly people .
marketing executive : that would be a if we should do something like that it would be a , it would be really good for the image of the company . and , there would be a good market for it .
project manager : that is the
marketing executive : if we are able to really bring an innovative product .
project manager : now you are talking about sixty to eighty .
marketing executive : the really
project manager : sixty .
marketing executive : but i would have to look into that a little more .
project manager : and different cultures . are we
industrial designer : i do not think they have different television sets in every country .
project manager : we have got five minutes left just now . small warning .
marketing executive : and with the little screen in it , which explains the buttons . you could we n it would be a lot easier to
project manager : should
marketing executive : adapt it to different cultures .
project manager : in different languages , . or you have to put a language button in it ,
user interface designer : right .
project manager : but that will be a bit unnecessary .
user interface designer : no .
project manager : it is better to put it on different markets with it all . that is the target . then a few small things . i will put the minutes in the project document folder . what we are going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept , user interface designer the user interface concept , and the trend - watching . just keep in mind the things we have said about the target group , requirements , and the trends which are going on . and specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach . i for this meeting . and we have a lunch - break now .
marketing executive : that is good .
project manager : that is a good thing .","the project manager stated the agenda and the marketing expert discussed what functions are most relevant on a remote , what the target demographic is , and what his vision for the appearance of the remote is . the marketing expert also brought up the idea to include a docking station to prevent the remote from getting lost and the idea to include an lcd screen . the user interface designer pushed for a user-friendly interface with large buttons , a display function , a touchscreen , and the capability of controlling different devices . the industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the project manager briefed the team on some new requirements they are to abide by . the team then discussed teletext , the target demographic , the buttons the remote should have , the idea of marketing a remote designed for the elderly , an audio signal which can sound if the remote is lost , lcd screens , and language options . the industrial designer will work on the components concept . the user interface designer will work on the user interface concept and trend-watching the remote will only be used for televisions . the user target group consists of adults age sixty to eighty . the corporate image must be visible in the design of the remote . the team will implement teletext in their design if it does not cost too much . the remote will only have a few buttons . the remote will have a docking station . the remote will have an audio signal to allow users to locate it when misplaced-the team will focus on creating a remote for elderly people . the remote will feature a small lcd screen . the remote will be fancy . the remote will be easy to learn . the remote will be made to accommodate different languages . cost of a touchscreen . whether to include teletext in the design despite the new requirement which indicates that the team is not to work with teletext . the user target group of adults age forty and up is quite small . what buttons and functions to include on the remote . whether to include a scroll button . whether to focus more on the layout of the buttons or the docking station .
","the project manager opened the meeting and stated the agenda . the marketing expert discussed user preferences in terms of the appearance and use of remote controls , finding that users wanted fancier and less complicated remotes , disliked the appearance of most remotes , and that younger users were interested in speech recognition . the research also indicated that users wanted fancier and less complicated remotes , and that younger users were interested in speech recognition . the research also indicated that users wanted fancier and less complicated remotes , and that younger users were interested in speech recognition . the user interface designer described the technical functions that will be incorporated into the design . the industrial designer described the interior workings of a remote . the project manager briefed the team on some new requirements and led them in a discussion about their target group , the option to include speech recognition , how to make an ergonomic remote , and the cost of energy sources . each team member will complete a questionnaire and a summary . the team members will spend time on their individual work . the project manager will post the minutes and project documentation . the team members will post their project documentation . the industrial designer will work on the components concept . the user interface designer will work on the user interface concept . the marketing expert will work on trend watching the team will not work with teletext . the remote will only control televisions . the corporate color and slogan must be incorporated into the design",,,,,,,,,6.0,Pegasus-Cons
33,"project manager : everybody found his place again ?
marketing executive : yes .
project manager : that is . so this is our second meeting . and still failing ? now we are going into the functional design . important thing of this phase is that we are going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . so that we can move onto the second phase . but first this phase . first an announcement . there is a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . so there is our ghost mouse again . that that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , that is because of this it is in wing c _ and e _ . it should be over in a while , couple of days . but it is going to be cold anyway , so i do not think you are gonna need it .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : then our agenda . now first the opening . this time i will take the minutes . you are going to have a presentation . and we have got forty minutes for the whole prese for the whole presentations . so i suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements which have been sent to me . and then the decision on the control functions which we wanna include and those which we do not wanna include . we have got forty minutes for all of it . i suggest let is start with the first presentation . who wants to be first ?
marketing executive : think i will go first .
project manager : just maybe it is easier if you will tell your presentation as . just which function you have and what you are gonna talk about .

industrial designer : i have got a presentation about the working design . first about how it works . it is really simple . everybody knows how a remote works . the user presses a button . the remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the t_v _ . the t_v _ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . so we have got the plate . it gots conductive disks for every button . when the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the led and transmits tranmi transmits its to the t_v _ . it is a very simple device , technically speaking . this is a schematic overview . you have got the buttons . the power source . and when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . the chip controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . when you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . we should use default materials , simple plastics . keep the inner workings simple , so it is robust . we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you are going to use high - tech materials the price is going to go sky - high . and you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high - tech materials it come back in every product . it is , in my idea , it is gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in the product itself .
project manager : now i hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . i am the project manager so i am here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements . that is , we have got to design a remote which is only suitable for t_v _ . that is because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it for more functions . so it has to be simple . another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be a thing of the past . and it is a function we do not need in our remote control . internet is also mentioned in a function we can use . maybe also on televisions it will be available as . another one is the customer is forty plus . that is the market we have to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . this is a bit pity for the marketing expert . because he was aiming on the younger persons . so we have to find a market which is above forty plus but which will suit our remote control , and the other way round . and we have to be very attent in putting the corporate image in our product . so it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . and we have to be very clear on this point as . i suggest let is have a discussion on the control functions .
marketing executive : is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ?
project manager : we can see if we can find a way between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product .
marketing executive : you are saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it is not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . and new t_v_s will have internet access on them . but if you are targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a t_v _ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim . in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . so it is pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . i am against it .
project manager : against the no teletext ?
marketing executive : besides that , the market for forty plus is like pretty small . but if i s if i see this , it is we are just gonna go for another
project manager : it is it is
user interface designer : forty
project manager : standard remote .
marketing executive : pretty
project manager : no we can
marketing executive : and not innovative
project manager : we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons
marketing executive : remote control .
project manager : which were also mentioned . if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons . or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market . if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it is the biggest share of the whole population now .
marketing executive : yes but it is not the biggest part of the market .
project manager : no .
marketing executive : and besides that , they are not very critical so they do not really care what the remote control is like . they will just take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable .
project manager : but do not you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market , that people think the people think that is the device i have looked for although i did not realise it . let is try it .
marketing executive : that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . because they are critical and they want to have a fancy remote control . people of forty plus , they want it to work , but as soo as soon as it works it is with them .
industrial designer : that if we are if we put our marketing right we can sell this just like i if you have heard about it in the news , the elderly mobile phone ?
project manager : it is a big success .
industrial designer : if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , .
project manager : very big success .
marketing executive : i have not heard of it .
project manager : .
industrial designer : we do not have to focus on the design then but on functionality . we just change our focus on the project , and we can sell this .
project manager : i simply think that the new products we are gonna make , spef specifically design , are designed for younger people , so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . and we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls . what you told is the channel selection is important . volume selection , power and teletext .
marketing executive : but the board tends to disagree .
project manager : we have not voted yet , teletext can be a function as . but only if it wo not higher the cost , because i if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as , but i do not think it will be a problem . or is teletext a
user interface designer : but deaf people need teletext for subtitles . so it is
marketing executive : also .
project manager : i suggest
marketing executive : it would definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext .
user interface designer : it is
project manager : is anybody really against teletext ? just that , that we just keep the teletext . that is a good idea as , especially for the subtitles . maybe we can make that another point of advantage in our remote control , if we make a k a button ex for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . for elderly people they can think , i wanna have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles .
industrial designer : that is a good idea .
project manager : teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . functionality should be few buttons , you said . that is very important we have a few buttons .
marketing executive :  .
project manager : so to keep it simple .
marketing executive : but i do not think that is really an issue any more might be .
user interface designer : if it is only for televi
marketing executive : but it , if it is only for t_v _ you are not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway . you need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel , volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but
project manager : but do you need
user interface designer : so we can s we can skip the display ,
marketing executive : if you only l
user interface designer : so we do not need it .
project manager : but do you need the buttons for one to zero .
marketing executive : nah .
project manager : maybe c we can
marketing executive : think if you are gonna include teletext you do . many people like to use that .
project manager : maybe we can use
marketing executive : if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you do not wanna push the next channel button thirty five times .
project manager : no , maybe we can implement the scroll button ? or a joystick like ? there are other ways too . just look if you look at telephones . the sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or
marketing executive : that is true but i do not think there are many t_v_s that can switch channels that fast . and so you would need like the t_v _ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . and if many channels would do have that . if many t_v_s have that .
industrial designer : and besides that it is if we are gonna focus on elderly people they will have to adapt . they are not used to using scroll buttons . so perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout .
project manager : the numbers . they can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display , and if it is too much we can reconsider it . but there wo not be very much buttons . or there do not have to be a lot .
marketing executive : but i do not think if you are gonna make a remote control only to operate a t_v _ , you there is not much you can gain on having as few buttons as possible . there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a t_v _ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . i do not think there is much to be gained in that area .
project manager : the number of buttons ? it is very important in the design . you can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places . and if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with
marketing executive : that is true but there is simply not much to gain on the competition when you are making a remote control only for to operate only the t_v _ .
project manager : to operate only the t_v _ .
marketing executive : if you have a remote control only to operate a t_v _ there is simply not a lot of buttons required . there is not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply do not have a lot of buttons either .
user interface designer : no .
project manager : so .
marketing executive : it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here . that would that would cost a big marketing expedition
project manager : .
marketing executive : which was one of the arguments to make it only for the t_v _ because we did not have the time to market a lot .
project manager : you suggest we could better focus on the docking station . like other functions . instead of f of less buttons .
marketing executive : maybe . , mean we need a good way to position all the buttons and but i do not think we should spend very much time in that .
project manager : . do you think the docking station will is allowed in the budget we have ?
industrial designer : it should be possible yes . if it is not too fancy .
project manager : it can be
industrial designer : and if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible
project manager : because that is that is a good advantage point as . if we have a fancy - looking docking station
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : or very that is a requirement . docking station .
industrial designer : we are just gonna focus on the extras ?
project manager : so .
marketing executive : maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a like to have extra in a new remote control .
project manager : that is a good point . you said they easily get lost as .
marketing executive : fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost .
project manager : so maybe we should implement the audio sign , .
marketing executive : that was what i suggested .
industrial designer : like with your key - chain , if you whistle it goes it makes a sound .
marketing executive : you have it on
user interface designer : hm .
marketing executive : you have it is on some phones too , which have a docking station . and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing .
project manager : . so
marketing executive : so where it is .
project manager : audio signal should be possible as . it is not too expensive . another point is the l_c_d _ screen . i if that will rise the cost too much , because
industrial designer : y i we will have to choose between the docking station or the screen ,
project manager : it will be too much as .
industrial designer : it is
marketing executive : since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we are focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . which would tell you what it does . and it would not have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen ,
project manager : based . just the l_c_d _ . just the normal screen .
marketing executive : just a small screen
project manager : that is a good idea .
marketing executive : with two
project manager : some extra info . that is a good idea as .
marketing executive : but if that would
project manager : as the small screen .
marketing executive : that would fit into the costs .
project manager : extra button info . that should be possible as . let is see what did we say . should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . few buttons , we talked about that . docking station , l_c_d _ . general functions and default materials . that is a good idea as , because elderly people do not mind if it is a titanium cover or just a plastic one . so that does not really matter . we nee
marketing executive : probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters .
project manager : let is specify the target group . because are we talking about elderly people or people from forty to eighty . because what we are going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . what do we want ? if we want a with the telephone for elderly people , we can target the real elderly people .
marketing executive : that would be a if we should do something like that it would be a , it would be really good for the image of the company . and , there would be a good market for it .
project manager : that is the
marketing executive : if we are able to really bring an innovative product .
project manager : now you are talking about sixty to eighty .
marketing executive : the really
project manager : sixty .
marketing executive : but i would have to look into that a little more .
project manager : and different cultures . are we
industrial designer : i do not think they have different television sets in every country .
project manager : we have got five minutes left just now . small warning .
marketing executive : and with the little screen in it , which explains the buttons . you could we n it would be a lot easier to
project manager : should
marketing executive : adapt it to different cultures .
project manager : in different languages , . or you have to put a language button in it ,
user interface designer : right .
project manager : but that will be a bit unnecessary .
user interface designer : no .
project manager : it is better to put it on different markets with it all . that is the target . then a few small things . i will put the minutes in the project document folder . what we are going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept , user interface designer the user interface concept , and the trend - watching . just keep in mind the things we have said about the target group , requirements , and the trends which are going on . and specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach . i for this meeting . and we have a lunch - break now .
marketing executive : that is good .
project manager : that is a good thing .","the project manager stated the agenda and the marketing expert discussed what functions are most relevant on a remote , what the target demographic is , and what his vision for the appearance of the remote is . the marketing expert also brought up the idea to include a docking station to prevent the remote from getting lost and the idea to include an lcd screen . the user interface designer pushed for a user-friendly interface with large buttons , a display function , a touchscreen , and the capability of controlling different devices . the industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the project manager briefed the team on some new requirements they are to abide by . the team then discussed teletext , the target demographic , the buttons the remote should have , the idea of marketing a remote designed for the elderly , an audio signal which can sound if the remote is lost , lcd screens , and language options . the industrial designer will work on the components concept . the user interface designer will work on the user interface concept and trend-watching the remote will only be used for televisions . the user target group consists of adults age sixty to eighty . the corporate image must be visible in the design of the remote . the team will implement teletext in their design if it does not cost too much . the remote will only have a few buttons . the remote will have a docking station . the remote will have an audio signal to allow users to locate it when misplaced-the team will focus on creating a remote for elderly people . the remote will feature a small lcd screen . the remote will be fancy . the remote will be easy to learn . the remote will be made to accommodate different languages . cost of a touchscreen . whether to include teletext in the design despite the new requirement which indicates that the team is not to work with teletext . the user target group of adults age forty and up is quite small . what buttons and functions to include on the remote . whether to include a scroll button . whether to focus more on the layout of the buttons or the docking station .
","the project manager opened the meeting and announced that the air conditioning system had to be adjusted . the marketing expert presented research on user preferences in terms of remote looks , usability , and functionality . he discussed the results of a usability study in which users rated remotes on a scale of 1-10 , indicating that users want a remote that is attractive , easy to use , has a high rate of misplaced remotes , is prone to rsi , tends to get lost , which indicated that the remote will be used less frequently , have fewer buttons , such as power , volume settings , channel selection , changeable , menusyrsy , the power button will be removed from the teletext function . group decided that they would like a simple design . they also discussed whether to include a scroll wheel for the remote , or a stylusable scroll wheel , to make the remote easier to use and to find it if it was not a difficult to find . it was decided to include an lcd screen on the remote and a spongy texture on the top of the bottom of the buttons . after the group discussed their respective roles in the project , they resumed the meeting . now move onto the user interface designer will work on the working design",,,x,x,x,,,,2.0,T5-Baseline
34,"project manager : everybody found his place again ?
marketing executive : yes .
project manager : that is . so this is our second meeting . and still failing ? now we are going into the functional design . important thing of this phase is that we are going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . so that we can move onto the second phase . but first this phase . first an announcement . there is a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . so there is our ghost mouse again . that that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , that is because of this it is in wing c _ and e _ . it should be over in a while , couple of days . but it is going to be cold anyway , so i do not think you are gonna need it .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : then our agenda . now first the opening . this time i will take the minutes . you are going to have a presentation . and we have got forty minutes for the whole prese for the whole presentations . so i suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements which have been sent to me . and then the decision on the control functions which we wanna include and those which we do not wanna include . we have got forty minutes for all of it . i suggest let is start with the first presentation . who wants to be first ?
marketing executive : think i will go first .
project manager : just maybe it is easier if you will tell your presentation as . just which function you have and what you are gonna talk about .
marketing executive : my name is freek van ponnen . i am the market expert . but you already knew that . i have done some research . we have we have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls . we let them fill out a questionnaire . we had one hundred of these test subjects . in addition we did some market research . see what the market consists of . what ages are involved . these are three quite astonishing results , . remotes are being considered ugly . f seventy five percent of the people questioned indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy - looking remote control . so in addition remotes were not very functional . fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . and fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . then we did some research to the most relevant functions . channel selection and volume selection both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . the power button got a nine . and teletext got a six and a half . so these are the most important functions on a remote control . then there are some one - time use function . that is what i like to call them . that audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . then these are the this is the market . sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . main characteristic of this group is that they are very critical on the remote control . they like to use new f new functions . but they also are very critical . they wo not spend their money very easily . the users of forty six to sixty five years cons the make up forty percent of the market . they are not really very interested in features . but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . what this indicates for our design . we should make a remote for the future . and this means we would have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . the results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused r_s _ r_s_i _ . this is certainly something to take into account . and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . so these are two factors that should be included in the design . besides that the remote must look very . and the functionality as a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , we should make very few buttons . this will also be beneficial to the design of the remote . the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons . they are used most and so they should be robust . they should not break down easily . then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room , it might be and i say might be because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot . but it might be a good idea to make a docking station . and this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . so you would know where it is in the room . and in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . then a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that an l_c_d _ screen in the remote control would be preferred . this was mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . but up till forty five it remains feasible . this would also greatly increase the production costs but these are just some small factors we could consider . that would be all .
project manager : anybody have any questions until now ?
marketing executive : any questions ?
project manager : about functional requirements ?
user interface designer :  .
industrial designer : no .
project manager : that is clear . now to the second .
user interface designer : i have been looking at the user interface of it . f for the techno f functions of it .
project manager : you can take your time . we have got plenty of time ,
user interface designer : ?
marketing executive : you should go to the top thingy .
project manager : .
user interface designer : we must use the general functions of the remote control . i have do i have done a little research on the internet and not much information about it , about interface but i have been thinking about a simple manner to put a lot of functions in one remote control . so you have got a lot of devi devices like d_v_d _ television , stereo . so but it must be user - friendly . you c you ca not put a lot of functions in one . in one remote control .
project manager : one remote .
user interface designer : but got many functions in one remote control , you can see , this is quite simple remote control . few buttons but this re remote control got a lot of buttons . people do not like it , so what i was thinking about was keep the general functions like they are . like the on - off button . keep it l like a red button . everybody knows it so you do not have to change that . my personal preferences . use a display for specific functions of the different device . wh what i was th thinking about was you have got this the remote control and you got here the general functions , like the on - off button sound and here you have got a s a display . it is a touchscreen . you got a general f the functions of the device for a d_v_d _ player or so the pl f for playing reverse . and you got here real buttons for selecting a device . this button is for a d_v_d _ or for every device you have got a f a b a part display of a part buttons . you never got all the buttons on w one device . that is my idea about it . and let is see . so a touchscreen . and th the buttons the real buttons we have to use . we better c use quite large buttons for everybody have to use it so ol even old people young people . we must keep buttons quite s simple and quite large . that was my part of it .
project manager : anybody has questions about the technical functions ?
industrial designer : if we are gonna use a touchscreen we are gonna go way above the twelve and a half euros .
user interface designer : n i do not . you got quite a cheap touchscreen . s it is not in colour .
project manager : touchscreen .
user interface designer : it is just one colo i seen w something on the internet not today but a few weeks ago . you got quite an a touchscreen and it is for twenty euros or less . so it is possible .
project manager : .
marketing executive : it would certainly make a fancy design .
industrial designer : but the it would not be very robust . it is very fragile and you can get scratches on it .
marketing executive : that is true .
user interface designer : that is true .
project manager : maybe we can first listen to your presentation ?
marketing executive : we would have to look into that .
project manager : and then we have a little discussion about the requirements and design .
industrial designer : that is .
project manager : it is going to it is not too much .
industrial designer : i have got a presentation about the working design . first about how it works . it is really simple . everybody knows how a remote works . the user presses a button . the remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the t_v _ . the t_v _ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . so we have got the plate . it gots conductive disks for every button . when the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the led and transmits tranmi transmits its to the t_v _ . it is a very simple device , technically speaking . this is a schematic overview . you have got the buttons . the power source . and when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . the chip controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . when you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . we should use default materials , simple plastics . keep the inner workings simple , so it is robust . we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you are going to use high - tech materials the price is going to go sky - high . and you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high - tech materials it come back in every product . it is , in my idea , it is gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in the product itself .

project manager : no we can

marketing executive : that is true but i do not think there are many t_v_s that can switch channels that fast . and so you would need like the t_v _ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . and if many channels would do have that . if many t_v_s have that .
industrial designer : and besides that it is if we are gonna focus on elderly people they will have to adapt . they are not used to using scroll buttons . so perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout .
project manager : the numbers . they can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display , and if it is too much we can reconsider it . but there wo not be very much buttons . or there do not have to be a lot .
marketing executive : but i do not think if you are gonna make a remote control only to operate a t_v _ , you there is not much you can gain on having as few buttons as possible . there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a t_v _ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . i do not think there is much to be gained in that area .
project manager : the number of buttons ? it is very important in the design . you can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places . and if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with
marketing executive : that is true but there is simply not much to gain on the competition when you are making a remote control only for to operate only the t_v _ .
project manager : to operate only the t_v _ .
marketing executive : if you have a remote control only to operate a t_v _ there is simply not a lot of buttons required . there is not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply do not have a lot of buttons either .
user interface designer : no .
project manager : so .
marketing executive : it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here . that would that would cost a big marketing expedition
project manager : .
marketing executive : which was one of the arguments to make it only for the t_v _ because we did not have the time to market a lot .
project manager : you suggest we could better focus on the docking station . like other functions . instead of f of less buttons .
marketing executive : maybe . , mean we need a good way to position all the buttons and but i do not think we should spend very much time in that .
project manager : . do you think the docking station will is allowed in the budget we have ?
industrial designer : it should be possible yes . if it is not too fancy .
project manager : it can be
industrial designer : and if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible
project manager : because that is that is a good advantage point as . if we have a fancy - looking docking station
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : or very that is a requirement . docking station .
industrial designer : we are just gonna focus on the extras ?
project manager : so .
marketing executive : maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a like to have extra in a new remote control .
project manager : that is a good point . you said they easily get lost as .
marketing executive : fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost .
project manager : so maybe we should implement the audio sign , .
marketing executive : that was what i suggested .
industrial designer : like with your key - chain , if you whistle it goes it makes a sound .
marketing executive : you have it on
user interface designer : hm .
marketing executive : you have it is on some phones too , which have a docking station . and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing .
project manager : . so
marketing executive : so where it is .
project manager : audio signal should be possible as . it is not too expensive . another point is the l_c_d _ screen . i if that will rise the cost too much , because
industrial designer : y i we will have to choose between the docking station or the screen ,
project manager : it will be too much as .
industrial designer : it is
marketing executive : since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we are focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . which would tell you what it does . and it would not have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen ,
project manager : based . just the l_c_d _ . just the normal screen .
marketing executive : just a small screen
project manager : that is a good idea .
marketing executive : with two
project manager : some extra info . that is a good idea as .
marketing executive : but if that would
project manager : as the small screen .
marketing executive : that would fit into the costs .
project manager : extra button info . that should be possible as . let is see what did we say . should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . few buttons , we talked about that . docking station , l_c_d _ . general functions and default materials . that is a good idea as , because elderly people do not mind if it is a titanium cover or just a plastic one . so that does not really matter . we nee
marketing executive : probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters .
project manager : let is specify the target group . because are we talking about elderly people or people from forty to eighty . because what we are going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . what do we want ? if we want a with the telephone for elderly people , we can target the real elderly people .
marketing executive : that would be a if we should do something like that it would be a , it would be really good for the image of the company . and , there would be a good market for it .
project manager : that is the
marketing executive : if we are able to really bring an innovative product .
project manager : now you are talking about sixty to eighty .
marketing executive : the really
project manager : sixty .
marketing executive : but i would have to look into that a little more .
project manager : and different cultures . are we
industrial designer : i do not think they have different television sets in every country .
project manager : we have got five minutes left just now . small warning .
marketing executive : and with the little screen in it , which explains the buttons . you could we n it would be a lot easier to
project manager : should
marketing executive : adapt it to different cultures .
project manager : in different languages , . or you have to put a language button in it ,
user interface designer : right .
project manager : but that will be a bit unnecessary .
user interface designer : no .
project manager : it is better to put it on different markets with it all . that is the target . then a few small things . i will put the minutes in the project document folder . what we are going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept , user interface designer the user interface concept , and the trend - watching . just keep in mind the things we have said about the target group , requirements , and the trends which are going on . and specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach . i for this meeting . and we have a lunch - break now .
marketing executive : that is good .
project manager : that is a good thing .","the project manager stated the agenda and the marketing expert discussed what functions are most relevant on a remote , what the target demographic is , and what his vision for the appearance of the remote is . the marketing expert also brought up the idea to include a docking station to prevent the remote from getting lost and the idea to include an lcd screen . the user interface designer pushed for a user-friendly interface with large buttons , a display function , a touchscreen , and the capability of controlling different devices . the industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the project manager briefed the team on some new requirements they are to abide by . the team then discussed teletext , the target demographic , the buttons the remote should have , the idea of marketing a remote designed for the elderly , an audio signal which can sound if the remote is lost , lcd screens , and language options . the industrial designer will work on the components concept . the user interface designer will work on the user interface concept and trend-watching the remote will only be used for televisions . the user target group consists of adults age sixty to eighty . the corporate image must be visible in the design of the remote . the team will implement teletext in their design if it does not cost too much . the remote will only have a few buttons . the remote will have a docking station . the remote will have an audio signal to allow users to locate it when misplaced-the team will focus on creating a remote for elderly people . the remote will feature a small lcd screen . the remote will be fancy . the remote will be easy to learn . the remote will be made to accommodate different languages . cost of a touchscreen . whether to include teletext in the design despite the new requirement which indicates that the team is not to work with teletext . the user target group of adults age forty and up is quite small . what buttons and functions to include on the remote . whether to include a scroll button . whether to focus more on the layout of the buttons or the docking station .
","the project manager opened the meeting and read the minutes of the previous meeting . the marketing expert discussed user preferences in terms of the appearance and use of remote controls , finding that users wanted fancier and less complicated remotes , disliked the look of most remotes , and that younger users were more likely to use them . he also indicated that users wanted a feature to help them locate their remote when misplaced , and that younger users were interested in speech recognition . the user interface designer described the technical functions that will be incorporated into the design . the industrial designer described the interior workings of a remote . he stressed that the remote must be functional and easy to use , must not cause rsi , must not contain too many buttons , and must not exceed 25 mm in size . the project manager briefed the team on some new requirements and led them in a discussion about their target group , the option to include speech recognition , how to locate their remote when misplaced , buttons for channel and volume selection , and energy sources . the team members will work on their individual presentations . the industrial designer will work on the components concept . the user interface designer will work on the user interface concept . the marketing expert will work on trend watching the team will not work with teletext . the remote will only control televisions . the corporate image must be recognizable on the remote . the remote will have buttons for channel and volume selection . the corporate logo must be recognizable on the remote . the remote will have buttons",,,,,,,,,7.0,Pegasus-Baseline
35,"project manager : everybody found his place again ?
marketing executive : yes .
project manager : that is . so this is our second meeting . and still failing ? now we are going into the functional design . important thing of this phase is that we are going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . so that we can move onto the second phase . but first this phase . first an announcement . there is a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . so there is our ghost mouse again . that that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , that is because of this it is in wing c _ and e _ . it should be over in a while , couple of days . but it is going to be cold anyway , so i do not think you are gonna need it .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : then our agenda . now first the opening . this time i will take the minutes . you are going to have a presentation . and we have got forty minutes for the whole prese for the whole presentations . so i suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements which have been sent to me . and then the decision on the control functions which we wanna include and those which we do not wanna include . we have got forty minutes for all of it . i suggest let is start with the first presentation . who wants to be first ?
marketing executive : think i will go first .
project manager : just maybe it is easier if you will tell your presentation as . just which function you have and what you are gonna talk about .
marketing executive : my name is freek van ponnen . i am the market expert . but you already knew that . i have done some research . we have we have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls . we let them fill out a questionnaire . we had one hundred of these test subjects . in addition we did some market research . see what the market consists of . what ages are involved . these are three quite astonishing results , . remotes are being considered ugly . f seventy five percent of the people questioned indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy - looking remote control . so in addition remotes were not very functional . fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . and fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . then we did some research to the most relevant functions . channel selection and volume selection both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . the power button got a nine . and teletext got a six and a half . so these are the most important functions on a remote control . then there are some one - time use function . that is what i like to call them . that audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . then these are the this is the market . sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . main characteristic of this group is that they are very critical on the remote control . they like to use new f new functions . but they also are very critical . they wo not spend their money very easily . the users of forty six to sixty five years cons the make up forty percent of the market . they are not really very interested in features . but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . what this indicates for our design . we should make a remote for the future . and this means we would have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . the results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused r_s _ r_s_i _ . this is certainly something to take into account . and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . so these are two factors that should be included in the design . besides that the remote must look very . and the functionality as a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , we should make very few buttons . this will also be beneficial to the design of the remote . the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons . they are used most and so they should be robust . they should not break down easily . then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room , it might be and i say might be because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot . but it might be a good idea to make a docking station . and this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . so you would know where it is in the room . and in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . then a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that an l_c_d _ screen in the remote control would be preferred . this was mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . but up till forty five it remains feasible . this would also greatly increase the production costs but these are just some small factors we could consider . that would be all .
project manager : anybody have any questions until now ?
marketing executive : any questions ?
project manager : about functional requirements ?
user interface designer :  .
industrial designer : no .
project manager : that is clear . now to the second .
user interface designer : i have been looking at the user interface of it . f for the techno f functions of it .
project manager : you can take your time . we have got plenty of time ,
user interface designer : ?
marketing executive : you should go to the top thingy .
project manager : .
user interface designer : we must use the general functions of the remote control . i have do i have done a little research on the internet and not much information about it , about interface but i have been thinking about a simple manner to put a lot of functions in one remote control . so you have got a lot of devi devices like d_v_d _ television , stereo . so but it must be user - friendly . you c you ca not put a lot of functions in one . in one remote control .
project manager : one remote .
user interface designer : but got many functions in one remote control , you can see , this is quite simple remote control . few buttons but this re remote control got a lot of buttons . people do not like it , so what i was thinking about was keep the general functions like they are . like the on - off button . keep it l like a red button . everybody knows it so you do not have to change that . my personal preferences . use a display for specific functions of the different device . wh what i was th thinking about was you have got this the remote control and you got here the general functions , like the on - off button sound and here you have got a s a display . it is a touchscreen . you got a general f the functions of the device for a d_v_d _ player or so the pl f for playing reverse . and you got here real buttons for selecting a device . this button is for a d_v_d _ or for every device you have got a f a b a part display of a part buttons . you never got all the buttons on w one device . that is my idea about it . and let is see . so a touchscreen . and th the buttons the real buttons we have to use . we better c use quite large buttons for everybody have to use it so ol even old people young people . we must keep buttons quite s simple and quite large . that was my part of it .
project manager : anybody has questions about the technical functions ?
industrial designer : if we are gonna use a touchscreen we are gonna go way above the twelve and a half euros .
user interface designer : n i do not . you got quite a cheap touchscreen . s it is not in colour .
project manager : touchscreen .
user interface designer : it is just one colo i seen w something on the internet not today but a few weeks ago . you got quite an a touchscreen and it is for twenty euros or less . so it is possible .
project manager : .
marketing executive : it would certainly make a fancy design .
industrial designer : but the it would not be very robust . it is very fragile and you can get scratches on it .
marketing executive : that is true .
user interface designer : that is true .
project manager : maybe we can first listen to your presentation ?
marketing executive : we would have to look into that .
project manager : and then we have a little discussion about the requirements and design .
industrial designer : that is .
project manager : it is going to it is not too much .
industrial designer : i have got a presentation about the working design . first about how it works . it is really simple . everybody knows how a remote works . the user presses a button . the remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the t_v _ . the t_v _ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . so we have got the plate . it gots conductive disks for every button . when the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the led and transmits tranmi transmits its to the t_v _ . it is a very simple device , technically speaking . this is a schematic overview . you have got the buttons . the power source . and when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . the chip controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . when you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . we should use default materials , simple plastics . keep the inner workings simple , so it is robust . we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you are going to use high - tech materials the price is going to go sky - high . and you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high - tech materials it come back in every product . it is , in my idea , it is gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in the product itself .
project manager : now i hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . i am the project manager so i am here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements . that is , we have got to design a remote which is only suitable for t_v _ . that is because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it for more functions . so it has to be simple . another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be a thing of the past . and it is a function we do not need in our remote control . internet is also mentioned in a function we can use . maybe also on televisions it will be available as . another one is the customer is forty plus . that is the market we have to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . this is a bit pity for the marketing expert . because he was aiming on the younger persons . so we have to find a market which is above forty plus but which will suit our remote control , and the other way round . and we have to be very attent in putting the corporate image in our product . so it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . and we have to be very clear on this point as . i suggest let is have a discussion on the control functions .
marketing executive : is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ?
project manager : we can see if we can find a way between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product .
marketing executive : you are saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it is not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . and new t_v_s will have internet access on them . but if you are targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a t_v _ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim . in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . so it is pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . i am against it .
project manager : against the no teletext ?
marketing executive : besides that , the market for forty plus is like pretty small . but if i s if i see this , it is we are just gonna go for another
project manager : it is it is
user interface designer : forty
project manager : standard remote .
marketing executive : pretty
project manager : no we can
marketing executive : and not innovative
project manager : we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons
marketing executive : remote control .
project manager : which were also mentioned . if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons . or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market . if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it is the biggest share of the whole population now .
marketing executive : yes but it is not the biggest part of the market .
project manager : no .
marketing executive : and besides that , they are not very critical so they do not really care what the remote control is like . they will just take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable .
project manager : but do not you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market , that people think the people think that is the device i have looked for although i did not realise it . let is try it .
marketing executive : that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . because they are critical and they want to have a fancy remote control . people of forty plus , they want it to work , but as soo as soon as it works it is with them .
industrial designer : that if we are if we put our marketing right we can sell this just like i if you have heard about it in the news , the elderly mobile phone ?
project manager : it is a big success .
industrial designer : if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , .
project manager : very big success .
marketing executive : i have not heard of it .
project manager : .
industrial designer : we do not have to focus on the design then but on functionality . we just change our focus on the project , and we can sell this .
project manager : i simply think that the new products we are gonna make , spef specifically design , are designed for younger people , so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . and we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls . what you told is the channel selection is important . volume selection , power and teletext .
marketing executive : but the board tends to disagree .
project manager : we have not voted yet , teletext can be a function as . but only if it wo not higher the cost , because i if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as , but i do not think it will be a problem . or is teletext a
user interface designer : but deaf people need teletext for subtitles . so it is
marketing executive : also .
project manager : i suggest
marketing executive : it would definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext .
user interface designer : it is
project manager : is anybody really against teletext ? just that , that we just keep the teletext . that is a good idea as , especially for the subtitles . maybe we can make that another point of advantage in our remote control , if we make a k a button ex for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . for elderly people they can think , i wanna have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles .
industrial designer : that is a good idea .
project manager : teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . functionality should be few buttons , you said . that is very important we have a few buttons .
marketing executive :  .
project manager : so to keep it simple .
marketing executive : but i do not think that is really an issue any more might be .
user interface designer : if it is only for televi
marketing executive : but it , if it is only for t_v _ you are not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway . you need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel , volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but
project manager : but do you need
user interface designer : so we can s we can skip the display ,
marketing executive : if you only l
user interface designer : so we do not need it .
project manager : but do you need the buttons for one to zero .
marketing executive : nah .
project manager : maybe c we can
marketing executive : think if you are gonna include teletext you do . many people like to use that .
project manager : maybe we can use
marketing executive : if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you do not wanna push the next channel button thirty five times .
project manager : no , maybe we can implement the scroll button ? or a joystick like ? there are other ways too . just look if you look at telephones . the sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or
marketing executive : that is true but i do not think there are many t_v_s that can switch channels that fast . and so you would need like the t_v _ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . and if many channels would do have that . if many t_v_s have that .
industrial designer : and besides that it is if we are gonna focus on elderly people they will have to adapt . they are not used to using scroll buttons . so perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout .
project manager : the numbers . they can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display , and if it is too much we can reconsider it . but there wo not be very much buttons . or there do not have to be a lot .
marketing executive : but i do not think if you are gonna make a remote control only to operate a t_v _ , you there is not much you can gain on having as few buttons as possible . there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a t_v _ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . i do not think there is much to be gained in that area .
project manager : the number of buttons ? it is very important in the design . you can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places . and if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with
marketing executive : that is true but there is simply not much to gain on the competition when you are making a remote control only for to operate only the t_v _ .
project manager : to operate only the t_v _ .
marketing executive : if you have a remote control only to operate a t_v _ there is simply not a lot of buttons required . there is not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply do not have a lot of buttons either .
user interface designer : no .
project manager : so .
marketing executive : it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here . that would that would cost a big marketing expedition
project manager : .
marketing executive : which was one of the arguments to make it only for the t_v _ because we did not have the time to market a lot .
project manager : you suggest we could better focus on the docking station . like other functions . instead of f of less buttons .
marketing executive : maybe . , mean we need a good way to position all the buttons and but i do not think we should spend very much time in that .
project manager : . do you think the docking station will is allowed in the budget we have ?
industrial designer : it should be possible yes . if it is not too fancy .
project manager : it can be
industrial designer : and if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible
project manager : because that is that is a good advantage point as . if we have a fancy - looking docking station
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : or very that is a requirement . docking station .
industrial designer : we are just gonna focus on the extras ?
project manager : so .
marketing executive : maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a like to have extra in a new remote control .
project manager : that is a good point . you said they easily get lost as .
marketing executive : fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost .
project manager : so maybe we should implement the audio sign , .
marketing executive : that was what i suggested .
industrial designer : like with your key - chain , if you whistle it goes it makes a sound .
marketing executive : you have it on
user interface designer : hm .
marketing executive : you have it is on some phones too , which have a docking station . and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing .
project manager : . so
marketing executive : so where it is .
project manager : audio signal should be possible as . it is not too expensive . another point is the l_c_d _ screen . i if that will rise the cost too much , because
industrial designer : y i we will have to choose between the docking station or the screen ,
project manager : it will be too much as .
industrial designer : it is
marketing executive : since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we are focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . which would tell you what it does . and it would not have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen ,
project manager : based . just the l_c_d _ . just the normal screen .
marketing executive : just a small screen
project manager : that is a good idea .
marketing executive : with two
project manager : some extra info . that is a good idea as .
marketing executive : but if that would
project manager : as the small screen .

project manager : that is a good thing .","the project manager stated the agenda and the marketing expert discussed what functions are most relevant on a remote , what the target demographic is , and what his vision for the appearance of the remote is . the marketing expert also brought up the idea to include a docking station to prevent the remote from getting lost and the idea to include an lcd screen . the user interface designer pushed for a user-friendly interface with large buttons , a display function , a touchscreen , and the capability of controlling different devices . the industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the project manager briefed the team on some new requirements they are to abide by . the team then discussed teletext , the target demographic , the buttons the remote should have , the idea of marketing a remote designed for the elderly , an audio signal which can sound if the remote is lost , lcd screens , and language options . the industrial designer will work on the components concept . the user interface designer will work on the user interface concept and trend-watching the remote will only be used for televisions . the user target group consists of adults age sixty to eighty . the corporate image must be visible in the design of the remote . the team will implement teletext in their design if it does not cost too much . the remote will only have a few buttons . the remote will have a docking station . the remote will have an audio signal to allow users to locate it when misplaced-the team will focus on creating a remote for elderly people . the remote will feature a small lcd screen . the remote will be fancy . the remote will be easy to learn . the remote will be made to accommodate different languages . cost of a touchscreen . whether to include teletext in the design despite the new requirement which indicates that the team is not to work with teletext . the user target group of adults age forty and up is quite small . what buttons and functions to include on the remote . whether to include a scroll button . whether to focus more on the layout of the buttons or the docking station .
","theControl functions . the marketing expert gave a presentation on the interior workings of a remote and discussed the findings of a usability study of 100 users using remote controls . the group indicated that the major functions in a remote were rarely used , the importance of adding new functions to a remote . the project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to abide by the existing design . the team discussed the option to include only the most frequently used functions in the device . the industrial designer will work on the components . the user interface designer will look at the user requirements will be incorporated into the design . two members of the team will create a prototype using modeling clay the remote will not feature a voice recognition feature . the case will be made of plastic with rubber grips to help find the remote when misplaced . the remote has buttons for power , channel selection , volume change , mute , channel settings , and a number keypad . all functions will be accessed through the screen on the television",,,x,,x,x,x,,2.0,BART-Baseline
36,"project manager : good afternoon . this is our third meeting already .
marketing executive : good afternoon .
project manager : i hope you enjoyed your lunch . presentation three . this is the second phase we are going to discuss today . it is the conceptual design meeting . and a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components . conceptual specification of design . and also trend - watching . these are hopefully the points you addressed in your pre presentations you are going to show me in a few minutes . but first i will show you the agenda . first the opening . then we have three presentations . after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . how we are going to make it . and then we are closing . we have about forty minutes . so i suggest let is get started . did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ?
user interface designer : no .
project manager : everything fine ? then a little thing about the last meeting . these are the points we on . the requirements and the target market . requirements are teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that button information . and we are going to use default materials . does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? these are just the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . and maybe we can work it out . and we are going to target sixty to eighty year old customers . so now everybody knows what we are do we are doing , i suggest let is get started with the presentations . shall we keep the same line - up as last time ?
marketing executive : i will start off then .
project manager : good luck .
marketing executive : doh . i am gonna inform you about the trend - watching i have done over the past few days . we have done some market research . we distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . and besides that i deployed some trend - watchers to milan and paris to get all of the newest trends . and i have consulted some additional trend - watch trend - watchers , after the original trend - watchers return , about what the best design would be . these are some overall findings . most important thing is the fancy design . the research indicated that was by far the most important factor . innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . by innovativeness this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls . about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . for our group , we are focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is , these factors are slightly more equal . these are some more group specific findings . the older people prefer dark colours . they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is the material for older people . this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about the look - and - feel that the remote should have . this leads us to some personal preferences . the remote control and the docking station should blend in the room . so this would mean no eye - catching designs . just keep it simple and the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the these would be the innovativeness in the remote control . so this would be very important that we at least include these features . the trend - watchers i consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone - shaped . so you could imagine that the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . this is not really this is a new shape to older people . so they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . so it would be kinda more telephone - shaped . besides that we would advise to bring two editions , one with a wood - like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey - black colour . the wood - like for the more exclusive people . people with more money . the grey - black colour for people with less means . that would be all .
project manager : any questions about the trends ?
marketing executive : any questions ?
project manager : mayb
user interface designer : no .
project manager : we go on to the next one .
user interface designer : some research a about designing of an interface . the last meeting we had a about using a f few buttons . so that is w what i want to do in our design . finding an attractive way to control the remote control . the i found some something about speech recognition . maybe we can use that . and using a little display . just we have just to focus on the primary functions . only buttons for sound , for on - off , shifting u up sa ca channel or down shifting down . and we need some new a attractive functions which attract people for using it . it is like a speak speech recognition and a special button for selecting subtitles . just what we mentioned last meeting . and overall user - friendly . using large buttons . it is possible to make quite cheap system for speech recognition . you can think about when you lost your remote control , you can call it and it gives an sig signal . and and for shifting up a sen c ch channel or for putting out sound , you can just give a sign say sound off or a and television put the sound off . i was thinking about the special button for subtitles , just one button to keep it simple . one push on the button you get small subtitles . double push , if double click , so you get big subtitles , for people which c f who ca not read small subtitles . and w we have to keep in general buttons so we have got the buttons we have to use . the on - off , sound higher or lower , the numbers , zero to nine . the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down channel . also we want to use a little d display for displaying the functions of the buttons . and we can build in a function f which shows the channel or some which the t television is on . made a little picture of it . just we can put the on - off button over in this corner , almost e all remote controls are using a on - off button on that place . so people will recognise the button . d display of it , it is just a small display . you can put it on top . it is most place where people , most of looks at . and a special button for shifting up and shifting down channel , it is on place where the thumb of the so you can easily shift up or shift down . it is quite handy place . so and all the f functions for subtitle one button , for sound and for our design , we have to discuss about it so the form of it and that is it .
industrial designer : about the components design . for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . but if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . so i do not think it is really an option . for the casing , the manufacturing department can deliver a flat casing , single or double curved casing . it is really up the design that we are gonna use . it is does not imply any technical restrictions . as a case supplement , we could , of that l later , a rubber belt , like a anti - slip . for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . and the chip - set , it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we are using an l_c_d _ screen . and as the trend - watcher presentation showed , people like wood , but it raises the price and it does not really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . form should follow function overall . the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . but depends on what we want . we should disc discuss that . for the case , the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . and the chip - set really should be advanced because otherwise it would really be a simple remote control . and that is it .
project manager : that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . so these are the points we have to discuss . first we can talk about the energy source , since that is has a pretty big influence on production price , and image . so f first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , .
industrial designer : yes w there are four options . we could use the basic normal battery . a hand dynamo . but i do not think that is really an option . you do not wanna swing before you can watch television . but not every room is very light so it is not a very good option .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : or the kinetic energy .
project manager : .
marketing executive : and how exactly does the kinetic energy work ?
industrial designer : y you shake your remote , and then it powers up .
marketing executive : you just you use it and it works .
user interface designer : nah .
marketing executive : personally i do not think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : and besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . and our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can get great popularity for our product .
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : wel
user interface designer : what is the function ? f for loading up the batteries
marketing executive : you could load up the batteries ,
user interface designer : b b
marketing executive : you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there .
user interface designer : but it wo not use much e energy i believe . it is just a small display so i believe it will run on one battery for six months or f or more . so i believe one battery is just enough .
project manager : elderly people just like to have everything in place .
marketing executive : that is true .
project manager : and i do not think they like remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . so maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and also what you said . you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : but it is more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . so you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . and then we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the channels .
marketing executive : i am wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ?
project manager : . that is a good point .
industrial designer : i do not have any information on pricing . so i will have to ask the manufacturing department .
marketing executive : in our earlier market research , if you would allow me to go to the flat board , smartboard .
project manager : .
marketing executive : so it was open here . we also asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . you can see here , our target group would not do that . so if that would increase the price for which we are selling our remote control i would greatly advise not to do it . that would be better to insert in our other product , that is meant for the younger people .
industrial designer : but that would also go for the l_c_d _ screen then i . it is a bit higher percentage , but
marketing executive : this is but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . so that does not really mean they would not pay extra for it . and on top of that the l_c_d _ screen would help in making the remote control easier to use . and a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use .
project manager : easier to use ? no , that is a good point .
user interface designer : but is our research about bi large l_c_d _ sh display , or just a small one we want to use ?
marketing executive : this was for like an l_c_d _ screen like you would have on a on the most advanced mobile phones . so pretty large .
project manager : i personally think the l_c_d _ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , nobody has anything against it . because it is just some extra information , and it is easy to ignore as . so if you do not wanna use it you just do not use it . and the maybe we have to discard the voice recognition . because it will increase cost signifi significantly . and i do not think the i do not think it will be a lot easier to use , as . that brings us back to the energy . if we do not have the voice recognition , it will it wo not use a lot of energy to use . in that case we could use kinetic energy , but just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . and much cheaper as .
industrial designer : and that is the best choice .
project manager : let me just choose for the battery . that brings us to the chip .
industrial designer : there is not any choice there because we are using the display .
project manager : just the advanced .
industrial designer : so it is got ta be advanced .
project manager : advanced chip . and then we get to the point of the case . which brings us a little bit back to marketing as . if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . as we saw there is not wood is a lot more expensive to produce .
marketing executive :  .
project manager : but it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . look i have got a new remote control , and
marketing executive : and most important factor there is the wooden colour . so it would not actually have to be wood , if it is just wood - coloured .
project manager : but with colour was a lot more expensive ?
industrial designer : i will have to research .
project manager : because
marketing executive : probably .
project manager : it is a lot more difficult to handle and to get in the right shape .
user interface designer : is it possible to make changeable case . you with mobile phones so like the nokia mobile phones , when you can change the case of it .
project manager : change the cases .
user interface designer : maybe it is possible possibility . you have just to make one standard remote control , and you can sell few
project manager : you can sell the cases . that is a very good option . because then you can advertise as with the give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . because that is a it is something extra , it is something other remotes do not have , which we can get a great advantage point .
marketing executive : that is true .
project manager : and then you can make them with colour . black and grey , other colours as .
marketing executive : we would have to look carefully into the design though .
project manager : costs .
marketing executive : we would have to make one w control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . the more original one , or the more standard one . so that would
project manager : you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , .
marketing executive : i would not design a telephone but no w we should just , we should then just design one
project manager : remote .
marketing executive : one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . so , but that should not be too much of a problem .
project manager : everybody is with the changing covers ? that is a good option .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : changing case covers .
marketing executive : i heard our industrial designer talk about flat , single and double curved . could you explain that a little more ?
industrial designer : the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . and our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases .
marketing executive : and what would single curved and double curved mean ?
industrial designer : it would just only affect the form , for as far as i know . so it is j really just up to the design department what we are gonna use . it does not really matter for the price or the functionality .
marketing executive : so we can just do whatever we want .
industrial designer : pick one you like , yes .
marketing executive : that is good .
project manager : but the form has to be it has to it is has to be possible to stand up ? or just only to lie down ?
marketing executive : no just to lie down .
project manager : and the cover of the docking station is also
marketing executive : we will go for that .
project manager : on top of the television then ?
marketing executive : or besides it .
project manager : and you can just then click it in . the interface . what type of interface do we want to use ? maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the board . does somebody have ideas for a form or
user interface designer : we can just use the regular form of it , but it is not quite fancy .
marketing executive : you said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side , so you could , so your thumb would be easily that was a very good point i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes r_s_i _ . so that would be great for that . maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side .
user interface designer : for for
marketing executive : for left - handed users also .
user interface designer : we is it possible to program it s so you got on the left side or on the right side buttons for shifting u up and shifting up ? and on the other o other side buttons for shifting , for the sound ?
marketing executive : for the volume . that could we could do that but i am not if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use .
project manager : usabili ease of use will be a lot more difficult , and then it is
marketing executive : but if we would make a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . it could be made all symmetrical and .
project manager : but you have extra buttons .
user interface designer : but
project manager : so people can get confused .
marketing executive : that is true .
project manager : especially if they have the same writings on it .
user interface designer : see . or we have to make a left for lefties
project manager : ca not we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same functions as the normal one ?
user interface designer : you mean
project manager : then you have to
user interface designer : if
project manager : let is see if i ca a blank one . and then you get here is a little l_c_d _ screen . now i have to think . it is a plus and a min . no it is not very handy . because the plus and the min will be opposite and all kinds of no that is not gonna work . maybe we should but is it a problem that left - handed persons use a different hand ? the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing a channel
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : it is just u using your thumb .
project manager : y .
user interface designer : it is
project manager : we could just leave it a normal shape . but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy . in one or ano another way .
industrial designer : we should start by choosing a case . because that is the basis you are building on . i could draw them out .
project manager : just
industrial designer : let is look at the flat case . it is from the side so it is rather normal . the the single curved so i am not really what they are gonna look like , but it is something like this . this type should be better for you or better should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit .
project manager : easier ?
industrial designer : and the double curved s looks something like this i . th those are the three options we have .
project manager : i suggest the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the screen in . so that elderly people can use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it is a bit , it has a bit of a angle .
user interface designer : do you say this s you got like a i believe there ? you want to put a display over here ?
project manager : . but now it is
user interface designer : we can make it
project manager : do you have it upside down
user interface designer : ?
project manager : do you have it
user interface designer : that is the top .
project manager : this that is top ?
user interface designer : this top . maybe it is possible to make this side like let is see . colour to make this side like the right colour . bit like so in the form of your hand . it is an so so the remote control have to lay in your hand . it is possib for s so and
project manager : get your mouse .
user interface designer : and to put the buttons for changing the channel over here
project manager : . that is a good one . but it is better to put the screen on top .
user interface designer : rem
project manager : just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here .
user interface designer : but this place
project manager : if you can have this one , you turn it like this . and then flip it upside down . because maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here .
industrial designer : it is more logical to have it on top as
project manager : i
industrial designer : because , like on your mobile phone , it is always above .
project manager : on top .
industrial designer : maybe you should just s start on a blank page .
project manager : then we get here is that is the curve .
user interface designer : five minutes .
project manager : here the display , and then buttons . and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . just that is for left hand and right hand users . and then h the rest of the buttons over here .
user interface designer : but the on - off button , still on the top
project manager : still here jus that is
marketing executive : and i would prefer the corners to be round .
user interface designer : .
project manager : should be more bit more friendly ,
marketing executive : think that would be better . friendly on the eye .
project manager : supplements . where is my mouse ? then we have got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we are going to use . so now for the next meeting we will have to look at the look - and - feel design . it is important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote . so check out the corporate website maybe . the user interface design , it is the same story . and product evaluation . so the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one . but you are going to get your instructions sended by the coach . just i will put these minutes on the in the folder . and then we are going to try to finish our project , and make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , . which are i am not if you are going to start right away to work together you are going to fill in the questionnaires first . and then you will get a message . maybe this one ? then we can save this one in the folders group . yes , it is here . smartboard , there it . if you wanna have a look at it , it is over there in the projects folder . and then i we will start in thirty minutes again .
marketing executive : very good .","the project manager opened the meeting and recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting . the marketing expert discussed his personal preferences for the design of the remote and presented the results of trend-watching reports , which indicated that there is a need for products which are fancy , innovative , easy to use , in dark colors , in recognizable shapes , and in a familiar material like wood . the user interface designer discussed the option to include speech recognition and which functions to include on the remote . the industrial designer discussed which options he preferred for the remote in terms of energy sources , casing , case supplements , buttons , and chips . the team then discussed and made decisions regarding energy sources , speech recognition , lcd screens , chips , case materials and colors , case shape and orientation , and button orientation . the team members will look at the corporate website . the user interface designer will continue with what he has been working on . the industrial designer and user interface designer will work together the remote will have a docking station . the remote will use a conventional battery and a docking station which recharges the battery . the remote will use an advanced chip . the remote will have changeable case covers . the case covers will be available in wood or plastic . the case will be single curved . whether to use kinetic energy or a conventional battery with a docking station which recharges the remote . whether to implement an lcd screen on the remote . choosing between an lcd screen or speech recognition . using wood for the case .
","the project manager opened the meeting and went over the agenda . the marketing expert presented the findings of trend watching , which indicated that the remote should be fancy , have a docking station , be telephone-shaped , and be easy to use . he suggested including teletext , an audio function , a small screen and be made of wood . she also suggested including two editions of the remote , one with a wood-like material and one in a grey-black color for people with less expensive . they discussed including the possibility of including a battery life extension battery , as well as features , such as a microchip , battery and a lithium battery . after closing , the group discussed their options for the remote and decided to use default materials to make the device a solar-powered rechargeable battery and to include in the design . it was decided to include a rechargeable lithium battery in the device and to use lithium batteries instead of rechargeable batteries . next the user interface designer will work on the interface a prototype evaluation .",x,,x,x,x,x,x,x,1.0,T5-Baseline

project manager : that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . so these are the points we have to discuss . first we can talk about the energy source , since that is has a pretty big influence on production price , and image . so f first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , .
industrial designer : yes w there are four options . we could use the basic normal battery . a hand dynamo . but i do not think that is really an option . you do not wanna swing before you can watch television . but not every room is very light so it is not a very good option .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : or the kinetic energy .
project manager : .
marketing executive : and how exactly does the kinetic energy work ?
industrial designer : y you shake your remote , and then it powers up .
marketing executive : you just you use it and it works .
user interface designer : nah .
marketing executive : personally i do not think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : and besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . and our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can get great popularity for our product .
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : wel
user interface designer : what is the function ? f for loading up the batteries
marketing executive : you could load up the batteries ,
user interface designer : b b
marketing executive : you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there .
user interface designer : but it wo not use much e energy i believe . it is just a small display so i believe it will run on one battery for six months or f or more . so i believe one battery is just enough .
project manager : elderly people just like to have everything in place .
marketing executive : that is true .
project manager : and i do not think they like remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . so maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and also what you said . you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : but it is more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . so you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . and then we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the channels .
marketing executive : i am wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ?
project manager : . that is a good point .
industrial designer : i do not have any information on pricing . so i will have to ask the manufacturing department .
marketing executive : in our earlier market research , if you would allow me to go to the flat board , smartboard .
project manager : .
marketing executive : so it was open here . we also asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . you can see here , our target group would not do that . so if that would increase the price for which we are selling our remote control i would greatly advise not to do it . that would be better to insert in our other product , that is meant for the younger people .
industrial designer : but that would also go for the l_c_d _ screen then i . it is a bit higher percentage , but
marketing executive : this is but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . so that does not really mean they would not pay extra for it . and on top of that the l_c_d _ screen would help in making the remote control easier to use . and a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use .
project manager : easier to use ? no , that is a good point .
user interface designer : but is our research about bi large l_c_d _ sh display , or just a small one we want to use ?
marketing executive : this was for like an l_c_d _ screen like you would have on a on the most advanced mobile phones . so pretty large .
project manager : i personally think the l_c_d _ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , nobody has anything against it . because it is just some extra information , and it is easy to ignore as . so if you do not wanna use it you just do not use it . and the maybe we have to discard the voice recognition . because it will increase cost signifi significantly . and i do not think the i do not think it will be a lot easier to use , as . that brings us back to the energy . if we do not have the voice recognition , it will it wo not use a lot of energy to use . in that case we could use kinetic energy , but just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . and much cheaper as .
industrial designer : and that is the best choice .
project manager : let me just choose for the battery . that brings us to the chip .
industrial designer : there is not any choice there because we are using the display .
project manager : just the advanced .
industrial designer : so it is got ta be advanced .
project manager : advanced chip . and then we get to the point of the case . which brings us a little bit back to marketing as . if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . as we saw there is not wood is a lot more expensive to produce .
marketing executive :  .
project manager : but it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . look i have got a new remote control , and
marketing executive : and most important factor there is the wooden colour . so it would not actually have to be wood , if it is just wood - coloured .
project manager : but with colour was a lot more expensive ?
industrial designer : i will have to research .
project manager : because
marketing executive : probably .
project manager : it is a lot more difficult to handle and to get in the right shape .
user interface designer : is it possible to make changeable case . you with mobile phones so like the nokia mobile phones , when you can change the case of it .
project manager : change the cases .
user interface designer : maybe it is possible possibility . you have just to make one standard remote control , and you can sell few
project manager : you can sell the cases . that is a very good option . because then you can advertise as with the give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . because that is a it is something extra , it is something other remotes do not have , which we can get a great advantage point .
marketing executive : that is true .
project manager : and then you can make them with colour . black and grey , other colours as .
marketing executive : we would have to look carefully into the design though .
project manager : costs .
marketing executive : we would have to make one w control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . the more original one , or the more standard one . so that would
project manager : you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , .
marketing executive : i would not design a telephone but no w we should just , we should then just design one
project manager : remote .
marketing executive : one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . so , but that should not be too much of a problem .
project manager : everybody is with the changing covers ? that is a good option .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : changing case covers .
marketing executive : i heard our industrial designer talk about flat , single and double curved . could you explain that a little more ?
industrial designer : the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . and our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases .
marketing executive : and what would single curved and double curved mean ?
industrial designer : it would just only affect the form , for as far as i know . so it is j really just up to the design department what we are gonna use . it does not really matter for the price or the functionality .
marketing executive : so we can just do whatever we want .
industrial designer : pick one you like , yes .
marketing executive : that is good .
project manager : but the form has to be it has to it is has to be possible to stand up ? or just only to lie down ?
marketing executive : no just to lie down .
project manager : and the cover of the docking station is also
marketing executive : we will go for that .
project manager : on top of the television then ?
marketing executive : or besides it .
project manager : and you can just then click it in . the interface . what type of interface do we want to use ? maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the board . does somebody have ideas for a form or
user interface designer : we can just use the regular form of it , but it is not quite fancy .
marketing executive : you said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side , so you could , so your thumb would be easily that was a very good point i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes r_s_i _ . so that would be great for that . maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side .
user interface designer : for for
marketing executive : for left - handed users also .
user interface designer : we is it possible to program it s so you got on the left side or on the right side buttons for shifting u up and shifting up ? and on the other o other side buttons for shifting , for the sound ?
marketing executive : for the volume . that could we could do that but i am not if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use .
project manager : usabili ease of use will be a lot more difficult , and then it is
marketing executive : but if we would make a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . it could be made all symmetrical and .
project manager : but you have extra buttons .
user interface designer : but
project manager : so people can get confused .
marketing executive : that is true .
project manager : especially if they have the same writings on it .
user interface designer : see . or we have to make a left for lefties
project manager : ca not we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same functions as the normal one ?
user interface designer : you mean
project manager : then you have to
user interface designer : if
project manager : let is see if i ca a blank one . and then you get here is a little l_c_d _ screen . now i have to think . it is a plus and a min . no it is not very handy . because the plus and the min will be opposite and all kinds of no that is not gonna work . maybe we should but is it a problem that left - handed persons use a different hand ? the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing a channel
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : it is just u using your thumb .
project manager : y .
user interface designer : it is
project manager : we could just leave it a normal shape . but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy . in one or ano another way .
industrial designer : we should start by choosing a case . because that is the basis you are building on . i could draw them out .
project manager : just
industrial designer : let is look at the flat case . it is from the side so it is rather normal . the the single curved so i am not really what they are gonna look like , but it is something like this . this type should be better for you or better should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit .
project manager : easier ?
industrial designer : and the double curved s looks something like this i . th those are the three options we have .
project manager : i suggest the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the screen in . so that elderly people can use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it is a bit , it has a bit of a angle .
user interface designer : do you say this s you got like a i believe there ? you want to put a display over here ?
project manager : . but now it is
user interface designer : we can make it
project manager : do you have it upside down
user interface designer : ?
project manager : do you have it
user interface designer : that is the top .
project manager : this that is top ?
user interface designer : this top . maybe it is possible to make this side like let is see . colour to make this side like the right colour . bit like so in the form of your hand . it is an so so the remote control have to lay in your hand . it is possib for s so and
project manager : get your mouse .
user interface designer : and to put the buttons for changing the channel over here
project manager : . that is a good one . but it is better to put the screen on top .
user interface designer : rem
project manager : just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here .
user interface designer : but this place
project manager : if you can have this one , you turn it like this . and then flip it upside down . because maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here .
industrial designer : it is more logical to have it on top as
project manager : i
industrial designer : because , like on your mobile phone , it is always above .
project manager : on top .
industrial designer : maybe you should just s start on a blank page .
project manager : then we get here is that is the curve .
user interface designer : five minutes .
project manager : here the display , and then buttons . and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . just that is for left hand and right hand users . and then h the rest of the buttons over here .
user interface designer : but the on - off button , still on the top
project manager : still here jus that is
marketing executive : and i would prefer the corners to be round .
user interface designer : .
project manager : should be more bit more friendly ,
marketing executive : think that would be better . friendly on the eye .
project manager : supplements . where is my mouse ? then we have got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we are going to use . so now for the next meeting we will have to look at the look - and - feel design . it is important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote . so check out the corporate website maybe . the user interface design , it is the same story . and product evaluation . so the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one . but you are going to get your instructions sended by the coach . just i will put these minutes on the in the folder . and then we are going to try to finish our project , and make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , . which are i am not if you are going to start right away to work together you are going to fill in the questionnaires first . and then you will get a message . maybe this one ? then we can save this one in the folders group . yes , it is here . smartboard , there it . if you wanna have a look at it , it is over there in the projects folder . and then i we will start in thirty minutes again .
marketing executive : very good .","the project manager opened the meeting and recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting . the marketing expert discussed his personal preferences for the design of the remote and presented the results of trend-watching reports , which indicated that there is a need for products which are fancy , innovative , easy to use , in dark colors , in recognizable shapes , and in a familiar material like wood . the user interface designer discussed the option to include speech recognition and which functions to include on the remote . the industrial designer discussed which options he preferred for the remote in terms of energy sources , casing , case supplements , buttons , and chips . the team then discussed and made decisions regarding energy sources , speech recognition , lcd screens , chips , case materials and colors , case shape and orientation , and button orientation . the team members will look at the corporate website . the user interface designer will continue with what he has been working on . the industrial designer and user interface designer will work together the remote will have a docking station . the remote will use a conventional battery and a docking station which recharges the battery . the remote will use an advanced chip . the remote will have changeable case covers . the case covers will be available in wood or plastic . the case will be single curved . whether to use kinetic energy or a conventional battery with a docking station which recharges the remote . whether to implement an lcd screen on the remote . choosing between an lcd screen or speech recognition . using wood for the case .
","the shape design and speech recognition . the marketing expert briefed the group on trends in the use of the latest trends and advised that the target group should be targeted towards users under 40 years old . the user interface designer presented two existing remote controls available on the internet , which the group decided not to use . the industrial designer gave a layout of the features the remote should have . the group discussed using the docking station and discussed what buttons would be needed to locate a button on the remote . the project manager announced that he would make a report containing the discussion of the meeting and the group's decisions regarding the features to include in the remote",x,,x,x,x,x,x,x,1.0,BART-Baseline
38,"project manager : good afternoon . this is our third meeting already .
marketing executive : good afternoon .
project manager : i hope you enjoyed your lunch . presentation three . this is the second phase we are going to discuss today . it is the conceptual design meeting . and a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components . conceptual specification of design . and also trend - watching . these are hopefully the points you addressed in your pre presentations you are going to show me in a few minutes . but first i will show you the agenda . first the opening . then we have three presentations . after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . how we are going to make it . and then we are closing . we have about forty minutes . so i suggest let is get started . did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ?
user interface designer : no .
project manager : everything fine ? then a little thing about the last meeting . these are the points we on . the requirements and the target market . requirements are teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that button information . and we are going to use default materials . does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? these are just the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . and maybe we can work it out . and we are going to target sixty to eighty year old customers . so now everybody knows what we are do we are doing , i suggest let is get started with the presentations . shall we keep the same line - up as last time ?
marketing executive : i will start off then .
project manager : good luck .
marketing executive : doh . i am gonna inform you about the trend - watching i have done over the past few days . we have done some market research . we distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . and besides that i deployed some trend - watchers to milan and paris to get all of the newest trends . and i have consulted some additional trend - watch trend - watchers , after the original trend - watchers return , about what the best design would be . these are some overall findings . most important thing is the fancy design . the research indicated that was by far the most important factor . innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . by innovativeness this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls . about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . for our group , we are focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is , these factors are slightly more equal . these are some more group specific findings . the older people prefer dark colours . they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is the material for older people . this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about the look - and - feel that the remote should have . this leads us to some personal preferences . the remote control and the docking station should blend in the room . so this would mean no eye - catching designs . just keep it simple and the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the these would be the innovativeness in the remote control . so this would be very important that we at least include these features . the trend - watchers i consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone - shaped . so you could imagine that the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . this is not really this is a new shape to older people . so they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . so it would be kinda more telephone - shaped . besides that we would advise to bring two editions , one with a wood - like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey - black colour . the wood - like for the more exclusive people . people with more money . the grey - black colour for people with less means . that would be all .
project manager : any questions about the trends ?
marketing executive : any questions ?
project manager : mayb
user interface designer : no .
project manager : we go on to the next one .

marketing executive : i heard our industrial designer talk about flat , single and double curved . could you explain that a little more ?
industrial designer : the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . and our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases .
marketing executive : and what would single curved and double curved mean ?
industrial designer : it would just only affect the form , for as far as i know . so it is j really just up to the design department what we are gonna use . it does not really matter for the price or the functionality .
marketing executive : so we can just do whatever we want .
industrial designer : pick one you like , yes .
marketing executive : that is good .
project manager : but the form has to be it has to it is has to be possible to stand up ? or just only to lie down ?
marketing executive : no just to lie down .
project manager : and the cover of the docking station is also
marketing executive : we will go for that .
project manager : on top of the television then ?
marketing executive : or besides it .
project manager : and you can just then click it in . the interface . what type of interface do we want to use ? maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the board . does somebody have ideas for a form or
user interface designer : we can just use the regular form of it , but it is not quite fancy .
marketing executive : you said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side , so you could , so your thumb would be easily that was a very good point i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes r_s_i _ . so that would be great for that . maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side .
user interface designer : for for
marketing executive : for left - handed users also .
user interface designer : we is it possible to program it s so you got on the left side or on the right side buttons for shifting u up and shifting up ? and on the other o other side buttons for shifting , for the sound ?
marketing executive : for the volume . that could we could do that but i am not if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use .
project manager : usabili ease of use will be a lot more difficult , and then it is
marketing executive : but if we would make a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . it could be made all symmetrical and .
project manager : but you have extra buttons .
user interface designer : but
project manager : so people can get confused .
marketing executive : that is true .
project manager : especially if they have the same writings on it .
user interface designer : see . or we have to make a left for lefties
project manager : ca not we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same functions as the normal one ?
user interface designer : you mean
project manager : then you have to
user interface designer : if
project manager : let is see if i ca a blank one . and then you get here is a little l_c_d _ screen . now i have to think . it is a plus and a min . no it is not very handy . because the plus and the min will be opposite and all kinds of no that is not gonna work . maybe we should but is it a problem that left - handed persons use a different hand ? the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing a channel
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : it is just u using your thumb .
project manager : y .
user interface designer : it is
project manager : we could just leave it a normal shape . but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy . in one or ano another way .
industrial designer : we should start by choosing a case . because that is the basis you are building on . i could draw them out .
project manager : just
industrial designer : let is look at the flat case . it is from the side so it is rather normal . the the single curved so i am not really what they are gonna look like , but it is something like this . this type should be better for you or better should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit .
project manager : easier ?
industrial designer : and the double curved s looks something like this i . th those are the three options we have .
project manager : i suggest the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the screen in . so that elderly people can use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it is a bit , it has a bit of a angle .
user interface designer : do you say this s you got like a i believe there ? you want to put a display over here ?
project manager : . but now it is
user interface designer : we can make it
project manager : do you have it upside down
user interface designer : ?
project manager : do you have it
user interface designer : that is the top .
project manager : this that is top ?
user interface designer : this top . maybe it is possible to make this side like let is see . colour to make this side like the right colour . bit like so in the form of your hand . it is an so so the remote control have to lay in your hand . it is possib for s so and
project manager : get your mouse .
user interface designer : and to put the buttons for changing the channel over here
project manager : . that is a good one . but it is better to put the screen on top .
user interface designer : rem
project manager : just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here .
user interface designer : but this place
project manager : if you can have this one , you turn it like this . and then flip it upside down . because maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here .
industrial designer : it is more logical to have it on top as
project manager : i
industrial designer : because , like on your mobile phone , it is always above .
project manager : on top .
industrial designer : maybe you should just s start on a blank page .
project manager : then we get here is that is the curve .
user interface designer : five minutes .
project manager : here the display , and then buttons . and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . just that is for left hand and right hand users . and then h the rest of the buttons over here .
user interface designer : but the on - off button , still on the top
project manager : still here jus that is
marketing executive : and i would prefer the corners to be round .
user interface designer : .
project manager : should be more bit more friendly ,
marketing executive : think that would be better . friendly on the eye .
project manager : supplements . where is my mouse ? then we have got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we are going to use . so now for the next meeting we will have to look at the look - and - feel design . it is important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote . so check out the corporate website maybe . the user interface design , it is the same story . and product evaluation . so the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one . but you are going to get your instructions sended by the coach . just i will put these minutes on the in the folder . and then we are going to try to finish our project , and make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , . which are i am not if you are going to start right away to work together you are going to fill in the questionnaires first . and then you will get a message . maybe this one ? then we can save this one in the folders group . yes , it is here . smartboard , there it . if you wanna have a look at it , it is over there in the projects folder . and then i we will start in thirty minutes again .

39,"project manager : good afternoon . this is our third meeting already .
marketing executive : good afternoon .
project manager : i hope you enjoyed your lunch . presentation three . this is the second phase we are going to discuss today . it is the conceptual design meeting . and a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components . conceptual specification of design . and also trend - watching . these are hopefully the points you addressed in your pre presentations you are going to show me in a few minutes . but first i will show you the agenda . first the opening . then we have three presentations . after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . how we are going to make it . and then we are closing . we have about forty minutes . so i suggest let is get started . did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ?
user interface designer : no .
project manager : everything fine ? then a little thing about the last meeting . these are the points we on . the requirements and the target market . requirements are teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that button information . and we are going to use default materials . does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? these are just the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . and maybe we can work it out . and we are going to target sixty to eighty year old customers . so now everybody knows what we are do we are doing , i suggest let is get started with the presentations . shall we keep the same line - up as last time ?
marketing executive : i will start off then .
project manager : good luck .
marketing executive : doh . i am gonna inform you about the trend - watching i have done over the past few days . we have done some market research . we distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . and besides that i deployed some trend - watchers to milan and paris to get all of the newest trends . and i have consulted some additional trend - watch trend - watchers , after the original trend - watchers return , about what the best design would be . these are some overall findings . most important thing is the fancy design . the research indicated that was by far the most important factor . innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . by innovativeness this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls . about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . for our group , we are focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is , these factors are slightly more equal . these are some more group specific findings . the older people prefer dark colours . they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is the material for older people . this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about the look - and - feel that the remote should have . this leads us to some personal preferences . the remote control and the docking station should blend in the room . so this would mean no eye - catching designs . just keep it simple and the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the these would be the innovativeness in the remote control . so this would be very important that we at least include these features . the trend - watchers i consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone - shaped . so you could imagine that the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . this is not really this is a new shape to older people . so they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . so it would be kinda more telephone - shaped . besides that we would advise to bring two editions , one with a wood - like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey - black colour . the wood - like for the more exclusive people . people with more money . the grey - black colour for people with less means . that would be all .
project manager : any questions about the trends ?
marketing executive : any questions ?
project manager : mayb
user interface designer : no .
project manager : we go on to the next one .
user interface designer : some research a about designing of an interface . the last meeting we had a about using a f few buttons . so that is w what i want to do in our design . finding an attractive way to control the remote control . the i found some something about speech recognition . maybe we can use that . and using a little display . just we have just to focus on the primary functions . only buttons for sound , for on - off , shifting u up sa ca channel or down shifting down . and we need some new a attractive functions which attract people for using it . it is like a speak speech recognition and a special button for selecting subtitles . just what we mentioned last meeting . and overall user - friendly . using large buttons . it is possible to make quite cheap system for speech recognition . you can think about when you lost your remote control , you can call it and it gives an sig signal . and and for shifting up a sen c ch channel or for putting out sound , you can just give a sign say sound off or a and television put the sound off . i was thinking about the special button for subtitles , just one button to keep it simple . one push on the button you get small subtitles . double push , if double click , so you get big subtitles , for people which c f who ca not read small subtitles . and w we have to keep in general buttons so we have got the buttons we have to use . the on - off , sound higher or lower , the numbers , zero to nine . the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down channel . also we want to use a little d display for displaying the functions of the buttons . and we can build in a function f which shows the channel or some which the t television is on . made a little picture of it . just we can put the on - off button over in this corner , almost e all remote controls are using a on - off button on that place . so people will recognise the button . d display of it , it is just a small display . you can put it on top . it is most place where people , most of looks at . and a special button for shifting up and shifting down channel , it is on place where the thumb of the so you can easily shift up or shift down . it is quite handy place . so and all the f functions for subtitle one button , for sound and for our design , we have to discuss about it so the form of it and that is it .
industrial designer : about the components design . for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . but if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . so i do not think it is really an option . for the casing , the manufacturing department can deliver a flat casing , single or double curved casing . it is really up the design that we are gonna use . it is does not imply any technical restrictions . as a case supplement , we could , of that l later , a rubber belt , like a anti - slip . for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . and the chip - set , it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we are using an l_c_d _ screen . and as the trend - watcher presentation showed , people like wood , but it raises the price and it does not really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . form should follow function overall . the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . but depends on what we want . we should disc discuss that . for the case , the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . and the chip - set really should be advanced because otherwise it would really be a simple remote control . and that is it .
project manager : that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . so these are the points we have to discuss . first we can talk about the energy source , since that is has a pretty big influence on production price , and image . so f first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , .
industrial designer : yes w there are four options . we could use the basic normal battery . a hand dynamo . but i do not think that is really an option . you do not wanna swing before you can watch television . but not every room is very light so it is not a very good option .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : or the kinetic energy .
project manager : .
marketing executive : and how exactly does the kinetic energy work ?
industrial designer : y you shake your remote , and then it powers up .
marketing executive : you just you use it and it works .
user interface designer : nah .
marketing executive : personally i do not think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : and besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . and our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can get great popularity for our product .
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : wel
user interface designer : what is the function ? f for loading up the batteries
marketing executive : you could load up the batteries ,
user interface designer : b b
marketing executive : you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there .
user interface designer : but it wo not use much e energy i believe . it is just a small display so i believe it will run on one battery for six months or f or more . so i believe one battery is just enough .
project manager : elderly people just like to have everything in place .
marketing executive : that is true .
project manager : and i do not think they like remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . so maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and also what you said . you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : but it is more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . so you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . and then we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the channels .
marketing executive : i am wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ?
project manager : . that is a good point .
industrial designer : i do not have any information on pricing . so i will have to ask the manufacturing department .
marketing executive : in our earlier market research , if you would allow me to go to the flat board , smartboard .
project manager : .
marketing executive : so it was open here . we also asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . you can see here , our target group would not do that . so if that would increase the price for which we are selling our remote control i would greatly advise not to do it . that would be better to insert in our other product , that is meant for the younger people .
industrial designer : but that would also go for the l_c_d _ screen then i . it is a bit higher percentage , but
marketing executive : this is but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . so that does not really mean they would not pay extra for it . and on top of that the l_c_d _ screen would help in making the remote control easier to use . and a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use .
project manager : easier to use ? no , that is a good point .
user interface designer : but is our research about bi large l_c_d _ sh display , or just a small one we want to use ?
marketing executive : this was for like an l_c_d _ screen like you would have on a on the most advanced mobile phones . so pretty large .
project manager : i personally think the l_c_d _ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , nobody has anything against it . because it is just some extra information , and it is easy to ignore as . so if you do not wanna use it you just do not use it . and the maybe we have to discard the voice recognition . because it will increase cost signifi significantly . and i do not think the i do not think it will be a lot easier to use , as . that brings us back to the energy . if we do not have the voice recognition , it will it wo not use a lot of energy to use . in that case we could use kinetic energy , but just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . and much cheaper as .
industrial designer : and that is the best choice .
project manager : let me just choose for the battery . that brings us to the chip .
industrial designer : there is not any choice there because we are using the display .
project manager : just the advanced .
industrial designer : so it is got ta be advanced .
project manager : advanced chip . and then we get to the point of the case . which brings us a little bit back to marketing as . if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . as we saw there is not wood is a lot more expensive to produce .
marketing executive :  .
project manager : but it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . look i have got a new remote control , and
marketing executive : and most important factor there is the wooden colour . so it would not actually have to be wood , if it is just wood - coloured .
project manager : but with colour was a lot more expensive ?
industrial designer : i will have to research .
project manager : because
marketing executive : probably .
project manager : it is a lot more difficult to handle and to get in the right shape .
user interface designer : is it possible to make changeable case . you with mobile phones so like the nokia mobile phones , when you can change the case of it .
project manager : change the cases .
user interface designer : maybe it is possible possibility . you have just to make one standard remote control , and you can sell few
project manager : you can sell the cases . that is a very good option . because then you can advertise as with the give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . because that is a it is something extra , it is something other remotes do not have , which we can get a great advantage point .
marketing executive : that is true .
project manager : and then you can make them with colour . black and grey , other colours as .
marketing executive : we would have to look carefully into the design though .
project manager : costs .
marketing executive : we would have to make one w control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . the more original one , or the more standard one . so that would
project manager : you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , .
marketing executive : i would not design a telephone but no w we should just , we should then just design one
project manager : remote .
marketing executive : one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . so , but that should not be too much of a problem .
project manager : everybody is with the changing covers ? that is a good option .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : changing case covers .
marketing executive : i heard our industrial designer talk about flat , single and double curved . could you explain that a little more ?
industrial designer : the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . and our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases .
marketing executive : and what would single curved and double curved mean ?
industrial designer : it would just only affect the form , for as far as i know . so it is j really just up to the design department what we are gonna use . it does not really matter for the price or the functionality .

project manager : really ?
marketing executive : right .
industrial designer : we had to buy one .
marketing executive : so so i suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , we d or is it going to make our product look a cheapie - cheapie option ?
project manager : production cost is at twelve fifty , so
user interface designer : pretty huge margin .
project manager : half of the selling price is taken up by building it . , and profit aim is fifty million euros , which is
marketing executive : in our first year ?
project manager : yi yes , i presume so .

project manager : no ,
marketing executive : user - friendly to everyone . big target group .
project manager : yes , i do not think we have to i do not think it is a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , making that a key point ,
marketing executive : no .
project manager : just that it is going to be in the international market like australia , america , things like that . what are your experiences with remote controls ? i have got we had three videos , a t_v _ and a amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls , that you programme each of your things into ,
marketing executive : alright .
user interface designer : that c
project manager : but that kept losing the signals so we would have to re - programme it every now . it was quite a cheapie as , so that might have had something to do with it , but that was quite good , the fact that you could you did not have six remote controls sitting in front of you .
industrial designer : use all the ones at the same time .
user interface designer : you wanna integrate everything into one like
industrial designer : you
marketing executive : my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object i buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme t_v _ and videos and things . but on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , i do not think i could go any further with it than that , so , i suppose it is got to be something usable by someone like me as .
project manager : the main that is the main anyway , and you do not want to i hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button like that .
marketing executive : and symbols that you do not necessarily understand , symbols you are meant to understand that you do not .
user interface designer : so simplification of symbols you could think of .
project manager : when they are when you have got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up to the other functions where you can do sound or options recording , things like that inside it . it does not make when you pick it up it does not make it really complicated to look at , it is obvious what you are doing , .
marketing executive : actually that just raises a point , i wonder what our design people think , but on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it is got a menu display ,
user interface designer : menu , alright .
marketing executive : i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , so you have got a little l_c_d _ display .
user interface designer : right , i was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an l_c_d _ di display like that , like a mobile , and with menus .
marketing executive : with menus , .
user interface designer : and if it is somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe .
project manager : what about the older generation ? what about granny and grandads ?
user interface designer : you mean to save it lesser number .
project manager : my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he could not even dream of texting like that .
marketing executive :  . can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?
user interface designer : right .
project manager : i do not think they tape things ,
industrial designer : my grandad is actually better than me at using teletext , so
project manager : i do not think they use
marketing executive : so that is a problem regardless of any design modifications you come up with , that is gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps ,
project manager : the age gap .
industrial designer : what it just needs to be as long as it is self - intuitive and you can work out what everything is doing , menus on new phones now they have got all these pictures and which makes it fairly obvious what you are trying to do .

industrial designer : but i how
project manager : i do not like the , the new phones that have got a windows - based running system . i find it really confusing , i kept getting lost in the phone , i di i have not got a new one but my friend got a new one and i was trying to do things with it and kept getting lost , but that is just me .
industrial designer : i how for twenty fi , or twelve euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , you would have to keep it down to a black and white l_c_d _ thing anyway , i would assume .
marketing executive : is it possible that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ?
project manager : teletext has got that option as .
marketing executive : it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that is the main thing .
project manager : or what about a dual function ? in that you have got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that is where you control recording and things like that .
marketing executive : the other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the flip over .
user interface designer : s
project manager : that is a cost thing , i how much we are gonna know about
industrial designer : y
user interface designer : it might it might save a b bit of space , it is i instead of looking bulky , it might look small .
project manager : yes , no that is important .
user interface designer : but it might have its cost implications .
marketing executive : like smaller . and there is no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , ? something that is easily moulded and produced . i am treading on your territory guys .
project manager : right ,
industrial designer : no
project manager : we have got half an hour before the next meeting , so we are all gonna go off and do our individual things . that is probably about it and then we will come back and liaise again and i get to do another fantastic powerpoint presentation .
industrial designer : just just a quick thing about the about what you are saying about the does it need to be fashionable ? the i had a quick look at the company website and it is like the we put the fashion into electronics , so the whole design thing might be qui
marketing executive : right .
industrial designer : you do not you can still have plastic
marketing executive : b y .
industrial designer : and it would look quite good but
marketing executive : but , it does not have to be that , th that was my main point , we do not have to use metal , i if using plastic does make it cheaper , i presume it would .
project manager : i would
industrial designer : .
project manager : it would probably . there is sky remote controls and everything . they are moulded and look a bit different , and the telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter , so i that is we can think about . , so let is break it up there . so , see you in half an hour .

project manager : so ,
industrial designer : but
project manager : i will be able to pull it up ,
marketing executive : .
project manager : or i could put it in the shared folder .
industrial designer : havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those the ones on the market at the moment they are s they are about twenty pounds anyway . so , it would still be
project manager : really ?
marketing executive : right .
industrial designer : we had to buy one .
marketing executive : so so i suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , we d or is it going to make our product look a cheapie - cheapie option ?
project manager : production cost is at twelve fifty , so
user interface designer : pretty huge margin .
project manager : half of the selling price is taken up by building it . , and profit aim is fifty million euros , which is
marketing executive : in our first year ?
project manager : yi yes , i presume so .
user interface designer : so then
marketing executive : you have got market range international and you did say earlier it is got to be a accessible and usable by all age groups just t we are not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it is everyone
project manager : no ,
marketing executive : user - friendly to everyone . big target group .
project manager : yes , i do not think we have to i do not think it is a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , making that a key point ,
marketing executive : no .
project manager : just that it is going to be in the international market like australia , america , things like that . what are your experiences with remote controls ? i have got we had three videos , a t_v _ and a amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls , that you programme each of your things into ,
marketing executive : alright .
user interface designer : that c
project manager : but that kept losing the signals so we would have to re - programme it every now . it was quite a cheapie as , so that might have had something to do with it , but that was quite good , the fact that you could you did not have six remote controls sitting in front of you .
industrial designer : use all the ones at the same time .
user interface designer : you wanna integrate everything into one like
industrial designer : you
marketing executive : my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object i buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme t_v _ and videos and things . but on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , i do not think i could go any further with it than that , so , i suppose it is got to be something usable by someone like me as .
project manager : the main that is the main anyway , and you do not want to i hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button like that .
marketing executive : and symbols that you do not necessarily understand , symbols you are meant to understand that you do not .
user interface designer : so simplification of symbols you could think of .
project manager : when they are when you have got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up to the other functions where you can do sound or options recording , things like that inside it . it does not make when you pick it up it does not make it really complicated to look at , it is obvious what you are doing , .
marketing executive : actually that just raises a point , i wonder what our design people think , but on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it is got a menu display ,
user interface designer : menu , alright .
marketing executive : i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , so you have got a little l_c_d _ display .
user interface designer : right , i was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an l_c_d _ di display like that , like a mobile , and with menus .
marketing executive : with menus , .
user interface designer : and if it is somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe .
project manager : what about the older generation ? what about granny and grandads ?
user interface designer : you mean to save it lesser number .
project manager : my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he could not even dream of texting like that .
marketing executive :  . can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?
user interface designer : right .
project manager : i do not think they tape things ,
industrial designer : my grandad is actually better than me at using teletext , so
project manager : i do not think they use
marketing executive : so that is a problem regardless of any design modifications you come up with , that is gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps ,
project manager : the age gap .
industrial designer : what it just needs to be as long as it is self - intuitive and you can work out what everything is doing , menus on new phones now they have got all these pictures and which makes it fairly obvious what you are trying to do .
project manager : i , i d
industrial designer : but i how
project manager : i do not like the , the new phones that have got a windows - based running system . i find it really confusing , i kept getting lost in the phone , i di i have not got a new one but my friend got a new one and i was trying to do things with it and kept getting lost , but that is just me .
industrial designer : i how for twenty fi , or twelve euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , you would have to keep it down to a black and white l_c_d _ thing anyway , i would assume .
marketing executive : is it possible that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ?
project manager : teletext has got that option as .
marketing executive : it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that is the main thing .
project manager : or what about a dual function ? in that you have got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that is where you control recording and things like that .
marketing executive : the other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the flip over .
user interface designer : s
project manager : that is a cost thing , i how much we are gonna know about
industrial designer : y
user interface designer : it might it might save a b bit of space , it is i instead of looking bulky , it might look small .
project manager : yes , no that is important .
user interface designer : but it might have its cost implications .
marketing executive : like smaller . and there is no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , ? something that is easily moulded and produced . i am treading on your territory guys .
project manager : right ,
industrial designer : no
project manager : we have got half an hour before the next meeting , so we are all gonna go off and do our individual things . that is probably about it and then we will come back and liaise again and i get to do another fantastic powerpoint presentation .
industrial designer : just just a quick thing about the about what you are saying about the does it need to be fashionable ? the i had a quick look at the company website and it is like the we put the fashion into electronics , so the whole design thing might be qui
marketing executive : right .
industrial designer : you do not you can still have plastic
marketing executive : b y .
industrial designer : and it would look quite good but

marketing executive : you can tell it is a flying animal could have been a seagull , i never thought of a seagull . an eagle , again i am thinking on my feet goodness . i suppose they are all so independent , i would put that one down again .

marketing executive : indepen independent , right , did you say they are good at golf ?
project manager : eagle .
industrial designer : no ,
marketing executive : are they ?
industrial designer : an eagle .

project manager :  .
marketing executive : intrepid . i will put that , intrepid . there we go , hope that pen is gonna be .
project manager : that was fun , right . finance - wise , we have got a selling price at twenty five euros , which i do not actually that is in pounds , .
industrial designer : it is about
user interface designer : one point four like that .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : seventeen .
user interface designer : one point four euro would make a pound like that .
industrial designer : something like that , so that
project manager : d fifteen ?
industrial designer : about seventeen , seventeen pounds , something like that .
project manager : seventeen .
marketing executive : seventeen pounds .
project manager : that is expensive .
marketing executive : should we be making notes of this ? we can just refer to this later ca not we ?
project manager : so ,
industrial designer : but
project manager : i will be able to pull it up ,
marketing executive : .
project manager : or i could put it in the shared folder .
industrial designer : havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those the ones on the market at the moment they are s they are about twenty pounds anyway . so , it would still be
project manager : really ?
marketing executive : right .
industrial designer : we had to buy one .
marketing executive : so so i suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , we d or is it going to make our product look a cheapie - cheapie option ?
project manager : production cost is at twelve fifty , so
user interface designer : pretty huge margin .
project manager : half of the selling price is taken up by building it . , and profit aim is fifty million euros , which is
marketing executive : in our first year ?
project manager : yi yes , i presume so .
user interface designer : so then
marketing executive : you have got market range international and you did say earlier it is got to be a accessible and usable by all age groups just t we are not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it is everyone
project manager : no ,
marketing executive : user - friendly to everyone . big target group .
project manager : yes , i do not think we have to i do not think it is a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , making that a key point ,
marketing executive : no .
project manager : just that it is going to be in the international market like australia , america , things like that . what are your experiences with remote controls ? i have got we had three videos , a t_v _ and a amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls , that you programme each of your things into ,
marketing executive : alright .
user interface designer : that c
project manager : but that kept losing the signals so we would have to re - programme it every now . it was quite a cheapie as , so that might have had something to do with it , but that was quite good , the fact that you could you did not have six remote controls sitting in front of you .
industrial designer : use all the ones at the same time .
user interface designer : you wanna integrate everything into one like
industrial designer : you
marketing executive : my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object i buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme t_v _ and videos and things . but on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , i do not think i could go any further with it than that , so , i suppose it is got to be something usable by someone like me as .
project manager : the main that is the main anyway , and you do not want to i hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button like that .
marketing executive : and symbols that you do not necessarily understand , symbols you are meant to understand that you do not .
user interface designer : so simplification of symbols you could think of .
project manager : when they are when you have got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up to the other functions where you can do sound or options recording , things like that inside it . it does not make when you pick it up it does not make it really complicated to look at , it is obvious what you are doing , .
marketing executive : actually that just raises a point , i wonder what our design people think , but on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it is got a menu display ,
user interface designer : menu , alright .
marketing executive : i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , so you have got a little l_c_d _ display .
user interface designer : right , i was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an l_c_d _ di display like that , like a mobile , and with menus .
marketing executive : with menus , .
user interface designer : and if it is somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe .
project manager : what about the older generation ? what about granny and grandads ?
user interface designer : you mean to save it lesser number .
project manager : my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he could not even dream of texting like that .
marketing executive :  . can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?
user interface designer : right .
project manager : i do not think they tape things ,
industrial designer : my grandad is actually better than me at using teletext , so
project manager : i do not think they use
marketing executive : so that is a problem regardless of any design modifications you come up with , that is gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps ,
project manager : the age gap .
industrial designer : what it just needs to be as long as it is self - intuitive and you can work out what everything is doing , menus on new phones now they have got all these pictures and which makes it fairly obvious what you are trying to do .
project manager : i , i d
industrial designer : but i how
project manager : i do not like the , the new phones that have got a windows - based running system . i find it really confusing , i kept getting lost in the phone , i di i have not got a new one but my friend got a new one and i was trying to do things with it and kept getting lost , but that is just me .
industrial designer : i how for twenty fi , or twelve euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , you would have to keep it down to a black and white l_c_d _ thing anyway , i would assume .
marketing executive : is it possible that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ?
project manager : teletext has got that option as .
marketing executive : it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that is the main thing .
project manager : or what about a dual function ? in that you have got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that is where you control recording and things like that .
marketing executive : the other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the flip over .
user interface designer : s
project manager : that is a cost thing , i how much we are gonna know about
industrial designer : y
user interface designer : it might it might save a b bit of space , it is i instead of looking bulky , it might look small .
project manager : yes , no that is important .
user interface designer : but it might have its cost implications .
marketing executive : like smaller . and there is no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , ? something that is easily moulded and produced . i am treading on your territory guys .
project manager : right ,
industrial designer : no
project manager : we have got half an hour before the next meeting , so we are all gonna go off and do our individual things . that is probably about it and then we will come back and liaise again and i get to do another fantastic powerpoint presentation .
industrial designer : just just a quick thing about the about what you are saying about the does it need to be fashionable ? the i had a quick look at the company website and it is like the we put the fashion into electronics , so the whole design thing might be qui
marketing executive : right .
industrial designer : you do not you can still have plastic
marketing executive : b y .
industrial designer : and it would look quite good but
marketing executive : but , it does not have to be that , th that was my main point , we do not have to use metal , i if using plastic does make it cheaper , i presume it would .
project manager : i would
industrial designer : .
project manager : it would probably . there is sky remote controls and everything . they are moulded and look a bit different , and the telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter , so i that is we can think about . , so let is break it up there . so , see you in half an hour .
marketing executive : do we go back to our room ?

",the team members introduced themselves to each other by name and by their roles in the project . the project manager talked about the upcoming project in which the team is to develop a remote control . the team practiced using the meeting-room equipment by drawing on the whiteboard . the project manager talked about the project finances and selling prices . the team then discussed their experiences with remotes and various features to consider in making the remote . the industrial designer will work on the working design of the remote . the user interface designer will work on the technical functions of the remote . the marketing expert will work on user requirements specifications the remote will sell for 25 euro . the remote will be sold internationally . the production costs cannot exceed 12.50 euro . whether the remote will be used exclusively for televisions .,,,,,,,,,10.0,Pegasus-Baseline
6,"project manager : help . it is up there ? that screen is black . , that is fine .
marketing executive : god .
project manager : are we done ? right , this is our second meeting and i might be a bit all over the place . , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ?
marketing executive : no that is ,
project manager : i will go over what we decided last meeting ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , t_v _ , video equipment . , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . we decided it was important to reflect the company is image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , that s thing . , our budget would have to affect try not to reflect our budget , that we might have a bit of you can see it , . dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . we discussed a flip - open design , reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming , things like that . , three presentations , i have got written here so shall we hear from marketing first ?
marketing executive : is it if i postpone that til later , want to get access to a little bit more information ,
project manager : no that is fine , that is fine .
marketing executive : is that ?
industrial designer : i will go first . can i grab the
project manager : unplug me .
industrial designer : what do i have to press ?
project manager : f_n _ function f _ eight .
industrial designer : right , . maybe there we go . this is the working design , presented by me , the industrial designer extraordinaire . , this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so . what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design ? , a device which just sends the signal to the t_v _ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel or the volume , everything is just some signal to change the state of the t_v _ or other appliance that it is sending the signal to . , so i decided i would have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . but although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make that our design stands out and that was something that it was not really my area because i am dealing with the inside really . so , i ran out of time so i could not do this one as fun as the last one . and i found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t_v _ presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you do not need to send very much information . , most of them are powered by some form of battery . now our one , i am not whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a _ batteries but those can be quite bulky so i d i did not know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control .
marketing executive :  . could i interject to ask a question there ,
project manager :  .
marketing executive : is that appropriate ? you are saying the triple a _ batteries are small or the surrounding it ?
industrial designer : no , if you look at most remote controls they are quite chunky and that is because of the size of the batteries , they have to be this certain size to fit those batteries in .
marketing executive : right , the triple a_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?
industrial designer : the
project manager : they are .
industrial designer : you can get the circular round ones but i am just wondering about power consumption
marketing executive : i see .
industrial designer : and how much you need to send the data across . , and d which leads onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . , now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . now the main components i came up with were the power source for the batteries otherwise it is not gonna work , as i said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can discuss that later and then you need something to decode the information that you are putting in from the controller now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is suitable for anyone who is watching the t_v _ unless they are in a cinema , which not most people do so as we are applying to the most audience that should be fine . and then i was just had a quick look at the external design but i d i left that mostly to the interface designer . and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wanna do . it is not a proper circuit , i am not if it would work or not , i am not even confident that those are the real way you would wire it up but anyway , we have just got the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the u_i _ interface which would , when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i_r _ data which could be decoded by the t_v _ receiver , which means that we are gonna have to conform to whatever form of communication that the t_v_s are already using and since that is another use and reason to use that infrared because that is what all t_v_s use at the moment . and then finally , we want the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that i have put forward are low in cost so that should be good . it should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about , because they are small they are also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti - going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , i th that was just a general point there .
marketing executive : that is a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so refer to that , whenever you like me to present .
industrial designer : alright , and , that is what i came up with there ,
project manager : very much .
industrial designer : so if you wanna
project manager : would you like to continue on from that ?
user interface designer : it can be
project manager : or , maybe move the laptop over .
user interface designer : that is with me . why is it not working ? f _ eight , right ?
project manager : f _ function .
industrial designer : function f _ eight .
user interface designer : why is it in the right ?
marketing executive : no . the plug has not come out at the bottom , has it ?
user interface designer : it is connecting .
industrial designer : no , no it is just .
marketing executive : meter adjusting .
project manager : there .
user interface designer : . actually some of my points might overlap with what william is just mention , but my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which we will take a feedback from the marketing because , i have not had some marketing data and every product is marketable . so purpose , as william already said , i would put it to simplify the interaction with t_v _ to make it as simple as possible . and to summarise i would say it is it should be user - friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . but we are to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together . so what the concept is to have a flip - top model . the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip - top . so it is like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of audience and we can punch in new f features such as added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . findings most people prefer us user - friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year and they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it is not of no use of punching in the trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . as we saw we have to make a profit also so we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production by fifty million we said ? , with that we will be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . , that is so this is if you ask me personally , i would make flip - top with a trendy design and s maybe we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use usage and all that . so in overall a simple and user - friendly design . any comments like , if you want ?
project manager : we will chat about it at the end , so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , it is vibrating , that is strange .
user interface designer : you will have to
marketing executive : have i got to keep this here ?
user interface designer : you ca not
marketing executive : does it matter ?
user interface designer : it will have to this ca not be pulled .
marketing executive : i will have t i will have to move it wo not i ?
project manager : we just do the best we can .
marketing executive : whoops .
user interface designer : you will have to push it a bit more .
marketing executive : will it manage ? bit more , dear .
user interface designer : this is more than enough .
industrial designer : there we go , i have got a bit more of the cable .
marketing executive : is that ?
user interface designer : you can pull it out now .
marketing executive : just pull it closer a little bit .
industrial designer : you should be able to and
project manager : you might .
industrial designer : there you go .
marketing executive : get it right over , .
project manager : look at that .
marketing executive : i am going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and our starting point with marketing is always market research . , so that is where we started , we used our usability lab , the company is usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross - section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . our findings , lots of findings , i have just summarised some of them here . the overall thing which i have got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but that is quite a high proportion of our , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that is a bit nicer looking . , current remote controls do not match with the operating behaviour of the user overall . , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , so you have got your person sunk back in the sofa channel - hopping . so again there is power implications there . , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we do not have so many functions actually on the remote control . the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier , remote controls are often lost in the room , it is a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , fifty percent were particularly frustrated by that . thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and that ties in with the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just ca not be bothered to learn about the other functions . , slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury . those small movements of the remote control can lead to shoulder and elbow problems . the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid in when they have lost the actual remote control , some speech recognition . something we did not put to them , but which i am thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . , that trend reverses in the older age groups . so thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it reverses , they are not so bothered with this . i had marvellous tables and things that i could show you , but i will just keep it simple , if there is any more information email you extra details ,
user interface designer : that is fine .
project manager : . right , we have new project requirements , we are not going to be using teletext , the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . our control is only going to be for t_v _ , it is not going to be a combined control , which limits all of the different things that it limits the cost for us , but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .
marketing executive :  , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?
project manager : it says for t_v _ only , so looks like it is just
marketing executive : just channel - hopping .
project manager : maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but i , what do you think ? it just said , for t_v _ only . but , general t_v _ controls do video as .
marketing executive : would that imply video use ?
industrial designer : t . i d the w if you have g
project manager : you bu som you get com you get combined t_v _ and videos do not you ?
industrial designer : . if
marketing executive :  , yes .
industrial designer : and if you got a sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the t_v _ anyway so on to like the t_v _ hard drive or so .
project manager : we assume that it is still got play and stop functions and programming .
user interface designer : anything about that on the market research like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?
marketing executive : yes . we did not really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about ten percent of the buttons ,
user interface designer : ten perc
marketing executive : th those do tend to be the basic channel - hopping things and on and off for the video , fast - forwarding , so on and it is general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare
industrial designer : ju just as an idea on the speech recognition thing that pr it would probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing
user interface designer : pens
industrial designer : and they are not that great anyway .
marketing executive : i have just called up that table there ,
industrial designer : alright , .
marketing executive : we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we did not differentiate . would you prefer an l_c_d _ screen , that is multi - function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? so you can see how the yes no varies across the age group there , and a substantial number of do not knows in the older age group , that is just general fear of new technology .
industrial designer : but on that again thought you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it will let off a loud noise to let where it is
project manager : bu
industrial designer : so that could be quite a
marketing executive : right .
project manager : we do have a budget limitation that we ca not control ourselves , so when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing because it is something i it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you do not lose , you were saying whistling ,
industrial designer : .
project manager : maybe on the t_v _ you could put like a pack on the t_v _ so you ca not see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the t_v _ and it beeps and you are like it is over there , something like that ,
marketing executive : that is a super idea .
project manager : but that is that sounds a lot cheaper to me . the third thing was that we have to make the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . so we want logo , we want fashionable , trendy , what you were talking about with the marketing . , people paying more for it to look good . , we need to focus on that as .
marketing executive : yes , further market research will be needed to focus on what that is , it is gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who is sixty and also across the world if we are aiming at the international market . what is attractive to a trendy new yorker and what is attractive to a retired south african , you get the idea . it is it is gonna vary around the world . at the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it is the user interface design that may and th the fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .
user interface designer : so are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ?
industrial designer : y you could have a number of different designs
user interface designer : alright .
industrial designer : inside they would be essentially exactly the same .
user interface designer : right . the features could be same and the body could look slightly different .
industrial designer : just , .
user interface designer : so
project manager : what about you were talking about the buttons , the controls that are coming out now have big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , we got to make it original , what about with the touch screen computers
industrial designer : that is what i was just .
project manager : ? so you it is like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which should not wear out as much either , not about the
industrial designer : you would not have to you do not actually have to press them you just
project manager : you do not have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it . , think that might appeal i am thinking japan , i am thinking young , office people ,
marketing executive : .
project manager : trendy a thing .
marketing executive : yes it will appeal to sections of the market def
project manager : but quite , easily labelled so that anyone can that is obvious what that is for and it is not daunting to maybe the older generations ,
marketing executive :  , .
industrial designer : but also er ergonomics as we are saying with the different designs , ergonomics there is physically different things if you have ever seen the x _ box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan would not buy it because the controller was physically to big
project manager : were too big .
industrial designer : because they are c just generally japanese people have smaller hands so they could not get round the controller which is so if you i what you can have bigger buttons for some countries and smaller ones for others .
user interface designer : maybe to as it was indicated that risk of repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that . so , a bigger b so y you are dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you are desi dividing it according to the countries also , the market . maybe for u_s _ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in japan and all you need to have a small , .
project manager : we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , .
marketing executive : th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , .
project manager : it is gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities , .
marketing executive : i am concerned , when you read the r_s_i _ issue again , repetitive strain injury , i do not think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , that is still a question mark issue how we deal with that . , r_s_i _ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements . i am j i really ca not get my head round this one , this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it is something we should think about .
industrial designer : i was just thinking about how you could combat that without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel
marketing executive : i know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes i know .
industrial designer : and it becomes
project manager : or a speech recognition ,
industrial designer : speech recognition ,
project manager : which is extremely expensive ,
industrial designer : but
project manager : that is the only way that you avoid that issue .
marketing executive : do we have to initially , looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . do we really have to go for everyone right away ?
user interface designer : we could focus on the biggest market . if say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?
industrial designer : ge
marketing executive : and when we have been throwing up our ideas we are automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people .
project manager : we are we are talking about the type of company that we are working for as . that they want it to be fashionable , they want it to be trendy and you would not automatically assume associate that with the older generations . now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people , but i do not think we are focusing on that , we are focusing on a mid - range , business class type people .
marketing executive : i am just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the broad scale marketing stage , we want to , not waste money , not be profligate and focus on where the idea will be taken up , first it is most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .
project manager : so the remote control functions . we have got the t_v _ , we have got the video , now there is i ca not remember what it is called , the little code at the end of programme details ,
industrial designer : video plus .
project manager : yes . we could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that i always found that really easy when i discovered it , because you have got your general record anyway so if you there is a programme on you want to put record on , that is fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you are not if you are going to , you put the number in
industrial designer : just whack in the number .
project manager : and it is just a number , it is not a date , it is not a time , it is not a channel , it is not when it finishes , it is not anything like that ,
industrial designer : and you w
project manager : it is just a number .
industrial designer : and you would not need a whole host of extra buttons for that ,
project manager : no .
industrial designer : you just need one you have already got all the numbers there anyway ,
project manager : you have already got the numbers for typing in anyway .
marketing executive : i have not come across that function but it sounds wonderful .
project manager : it is after if you look in the newspaper , t_v _ guide or any t_v _ guide there is a five , six digit number afterwards
industrial designer : it is not
project manager : and that is the number you put in and it is recorded that it is going to be on tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth so you do not have to worry about dates and you do not have to worry about times , and it has been around for quite a long time .
industrial designer : it is been around for a long time it is just it is not very advertised as to how to use it and things .
project manager : no it is not but if awareness was brought to the forefront about that
marketing executive : superb .
industrial designer : though if y if you have got something like sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it will record that programme when it is on and you press it on it twice and it will record the whole series .
marketing executive : excellent ,  .
industrial designer : so that . but just to have that function would be really good .
project manager : so
marketing executive : can run this past you while it occurs to me , i do not mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that is what led us on to comparing t_v _ remote controls with their design features , chain companies like carphone warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you have got any problems with it and they will fix it , they will phone the company , you can use their telephones . is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th , which button is it i press for this ? th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?
industrial designer : but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they the companies who you deal with have actually they have got an obligation to help you out and also it is fair enough to have some help service but i am not how much the cost would be of having
project manager : the functionality of it in the sense that you are sitting there , you are pressing this button and your t_v _ is not doing it . taking your t_v _ and your control and saying look this is what i am doing , it is not working , what should i do ?
marketing executive : alright . yes if it was something as simple as you could not change the channel , but for if there were any more or are we definite it is only gonna be for t_v _ and video ,
project manager : so .
industrial designer :
marketing executive : we are not gonna put any , just a thought .
industrial designer : instru instruction books i feel c i reckon can cover that .
project manager : instruction manuals . but they are there is customer service , there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to
industrial designer : department , .
project manager : and that way there is no call out charge , there is no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , .
user interface designer : it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .
industrial designer : and they are
marketing executive : not for such simple functions
industrial designer : they should be f .
marketing executive : because we are focusing on that ,
project manager : but we should focus on making the manual as user - friendly as possible
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : simple .
project manager : because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots of pages .
marketing executive : puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes .
project manager : it does ,
industrial designer : it is the
project manager : you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about . , what other functions ? we need i am not if we need a design decision now , but we should think about c you have got the dilemma between batteries , that is what i was thinking about . mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ?
industrial designer : they are specially made for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , you could bundle a charger in with it but
project manager : they la they last quite a long time ,
industrial designer :  .
project manager : and if you had when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you are not using it or t at night , but it does not really matter it never really runs out it lasts a long time once it is charged . , something like that should reduce the size of it .
industrial designer : and if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could
project manager : it could be on that , .
industrial designer : on that as so .
user interface designer : so are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?
project manager : s yes .
industrial designer : some docking station or
project manager : rechargeable with a docking station . so the rechargeable which would be your field .
industrial designer : th that would be fine , and also that would mean they would not have to go out buying batteries all the time .
project manager : yes , which it is cheaper in the long run as . , th the shape you got trendy . i do not wanna big box with lots of things , you do not want a tiny little thing either , because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple ,
marketing executive : and we do not w so many remote controls look identical ,
project manager : they do .
marketing executive : these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . we definitely an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we do not want that .
project manager : so we have got a flip - screen .
user interface designer : what i was thinking of a design which nokia h came up with almost six or seven years back . we have a flat one it looks like a box , like a chocolate . that is very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , and you do not have to you do not bend your thumb too much , so it is like you can say a banana shape thing , curled up like a boat .
marketing executive : slightly curved , curved .
user interface designer : g so what happens is you do not have to press your thumb too down like . so it is already curled up so your thumb does not
project manager : it is moulded to your hand anyway .
user interface designer : y so we can have a s like moulded according to your the way you h hold of it is semi - circular in the bottom , something like that . i would not say exactly semi - circular but smooth .
project manager : can you look into the company logo ? , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product .
user interface designer : current .
project manager : if it was a c _ like that , you could have it in a vague c _ shape that opens up like a shell ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite into the design , while also making it quite different from anything else that is there .
user interface designer : we could look in at that but . what we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea - shells ,
marketing executive : look at the mobile .
user interface designer : logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of the model , rather than , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like .
project manager : we need to think about how it is gonna look different .
marketing executive : that is that sounds a really attractive idea ,
user interface designer : a sea shell ?
marketing executive : i have not come across anything like that before , if it and that opens out into your flip - top . then it is t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you are having to actually insert in between the two covers , that is gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that i would think . it is a really idea
user interface designer : we could look in at that .
marketing executive : and plus you can get even though we are using plastic , you can still think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a conch shell or scallop shell exterior .
project manager : or you could do different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . you could have different casings . so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and
marketing executive : less chance of it being lost too , it is not like a chocolate brown lozenge that is gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a ornament they do not not gonna lose it so much either . it is easier to bit to handle .
user interface designer : maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , that could be the most common design . but we can like think of five , six designs .
project manager : right , we have to round it up ,
marketing executive : can quickly go over the new project requirements so that i have not missed anything . so it is no teletext , it is only for t_v _ and by implication video , our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , something about videoplus .
project manager : that was in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date
marketing executive : right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the l_c_d _ , a reminder about using videoplus ? so that they have a look at the guide and or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just that was an add - on feature ?
project manager : it is kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that .
marketing executive : right , so it is doing away with the programming feature ?
project manager : it could be it c it yes , it could be adv advertisement feature , rather than design feature , drawing attention to that . and it also paid lip service in the instruction manual , it is very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful .
marketing executive : and the rechargeable batteries . was there anything else there that we in the new project requirements ?
project manager : we have got the buttons but we will work through that with the design of it , .
marketing executive : that is not at the moment a requirement , it is something we are looking at ,
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like .
project manager : and we have talked about there being an alarm , a beeping for being lost , .
user interface designer : for detection , right .
project manager : learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . but there are not gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the i the instruction manual , i if we deal with that , . and different from what is out there .
user interface designer : true .
marketing executive : what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? or shall generally look the issues involved ?
project manager : you might get guidance , but i th instruction manuals , there tends to be a demonised thing , u , they are everyone is got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them .
marketing executive : whoops , questionnaire four .
user interface designer : we should f
project manager : yes , right .
user interface designer : it is time for us to get back to
marketing executive : we are at lunchtime now .
project manager : you can email me , if there is any more questions . and i will be able to not answer them .","the industrial designer gave his presentation on the basic functions of the remote . he presented the basic components that remotes share and suggested that smaller batteries be considered in the product design . the user interface designer presented his ideas for making the remote easy-to-use; he discussed using a simple design and hiding complicated features from the main interface . the marketing expert presented the findings from a lab study on user requirements for a remote control device , and discussed users' demand for a simple interface and advanced technology . the project manager presented the new requirements that the remote not include a teletext function , that it be used only to control television , and that it include the company image in its design . the group narrowed down their target marketing group to the youth market . they discussed the functions the remote will have , including video plus capability and rechargeable batteries . a customer service plan was suggested to make the remote seem more user-friendly , but it was decided that helpful manuals were more within the budget . the group then discussed the shell-like shape of the remote and including several different casing options to buyers . the marketing expert will research consumers' opinions on instruction manuals . it was decided that the group will produce one product design instead of creating alternate designs in an attempt to accomodate different users' preferences . the marketing will be focused towards a young , business-class buyer . the remote will feature video plus capabilities and a seashell-like shape to accomodate the lcd display and the flip screen . the remote will be bundled with a docking station to recharge the remote's batteries and a user-friendly instruction manual , and multiple casings will be made available . the limitations of the budget will restrict the development of some features; several of the features that the group wanted to include may have to be made simpler to decrease cost .
","the project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented their prototype and discussed the features the prototype contained . the industrial designer presented the options for types of batteries , shapes for the remote , and materials to use in making the case . the user interface designer discussed how speech recognition could be used to create an interface for an ergonomic remote . the marketing expert presented feedback from users and users indicated that the prototype had met many of the initial goals . the team then discussed features to include in the remote such as an lcd screen , a jog dial , and speech recognition . the program manager said that he would ask to what extent the company logo had to be incorporated into the design in order to keep the price point of the device close to the original goal . the group decided to use triple a batteries in their design . the remote will be powered by a single battery . the case will be single-curved . there will be no display physically featured on the remote itself; instead the device will be designed to look like a flip-open book . a locator function will be included to help locate the remote when lost . speech recognition will be implemented by adding a small button to the side of the remote which will operate either through voice recognition or through paging . the target age group is people aged fifteen to thirty five . the power source will be a normal aa battery . size of the battery . whether to use a triple a battery . how to minimize the",X,,,,,,,,8.0,BART-Baseline
7,"project manager : help . it is up there ? that screen is black . , that is fine .
marketing executive : god .
project manager : are we done ? right , this is our second meeting and i might be a bit all over the place . , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ?
marketing executive : no that is ,
project manager : i will go over what we decided last meeting ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , t_v _ , video equipment . , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . we decided it was important to reflect the company is image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , that s thing . , our budget would have to affect try not to reflect our budget , that we might have a bit of you can see it , . dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . we discussed a flip - open design , reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming , things like that . , three presentations , i have got written here so shall we hear from marketing first ?
marketing executive : is it if i postpone that til later , want to get access to a little bit more information ,
project manager : no that is fine , that is fine .
marketing executive : is that ?
industrial designer : i will go first . can i grab the
project manager : unplug me .
industrial designer : what do i have to press ?
project manager : f_n _ function f _ eight .
industrial designer : right , . maybe there we go . this is the working design , presented by me , the industrial designer extraordinaire . , this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so . what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design ? , a device which just sends the signal to the t_v _ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel or the volume , everything is just some signal to change the state of the t_v _ or other appliance that it is sending the signal to . , so i decided i would have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . but although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make that our design stands out and that was something that it was not really my area because i am dealing with the inside really . so , i ran out of time so i could not do this one as fun as the last one . and i found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t_v _ presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you do not need to send very much information . , most of them are powered by some form of battery . now our one , i am not whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a _ batteries but those can be quite bulky so i d i did not know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control .
marketing executive :  . could i interject to ask a question there ,
project manager :  .
marketing executive : is that appropriate ? you are saying the triple a _ batteries are small or the surrounding it ?
industrial designer : no , if you look at most remote controls they are quite chunky and that is because of the size of the batteries , they have to be this certain size to fit those batteries in .
marketing executive : right , the triple a_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?
industrial designer : the
project manager : they are .
industrial designer : you can get the circular round ones but i am just wondering about power consumption
marketing executive : i see .
industrial designer : and how much you need to send the data across . , and d which leads onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . , now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . now the main components i came up with were the power source for the batteries otherwise it is not gonna work , as i said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can discuss that later and then you need something to decode the information that you are putting in from the controller now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is suitable for anyone who is watching the t_v _ unless they are in a cinema , which not most people do so as we are applying to the most audience that should be fine . and then i was just had a quick look at the external design but i d i left that mostly to the interface designer . and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wanna do . it is not a proper circuit , i am not if it would work or not , i am not even confident that those are the real way you would wire it up but anyway , we have just got the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the u_i _ interface which would , when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i_r _ data which could be decoded by the t_v _ receiver , which means that we are gonna have to conform to whatever form of communication that the t_v_s are already using and since that is another use and reason to use that infrared because that is what all t_v_s use at the moment . and then finally , we want the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that i have put forward are low in cost so that should be good . it should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about , because they are small they are also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti - going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , i th that was just a general point there .
marketing executive : that is a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so refer to that , whenever you like me to present .
industrial designer : alright , and , that is what i came up with there ,
project manager : very much .
industrial designer : so if you wanna
project manager : would you like to continue on from that ?
user interface designer : it can be
project manager : or , maybe move the laptop over .
user interface designer : that is with me . why is it not working ? f _ eight , right ?
project manager : f _ function .
industrial designer : function f _ eight .
user interface designer : why is it in the right ?
marketing executive : no . the plug has not come out at the bottom , has it ?
user interface designer : it is connecting .
industrial designer : no , no it is just .
marketing executive : meter adjusting .
project manager : there .
user interface designer : . actually some of my points might overlap with what william is just mention , but my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which we will take a feedback from the marketing because , i have not had some marketing data and every product is marketable . so purpose , as william already said , i would put it to simplify the interaction with t_v _ to make it as simple as possible . and to summarise i would say it is it should be user - friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . but we are to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together . so what the concept is to have a flip - top model . the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip - top . so it is like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of audience and we can punch in new f features such as added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . findings most people prefer us user - friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year and they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it is not of no use of punching in the trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . as we saw we have to make a profit also so we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production by fifty million we said ? , with that we will be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . , that is so this is if you ask me personally , i would make flip - top with a trendy design and s maybe we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use usage and all that . so in overall a simple and user - friendly design . any comments like , if you want ?
project manager : we will chat about it at the end , so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , it is vibrating , that is strange .
user interface designer : you will have to
marketing executive : have i got to keep this here ?
user interface designer : you ca not
marketing executive : does it matter ?
user interface designer : it will have to this ca not be pulled .
marketing executive : i will have t i will have to move it wo not i ?
project manager : we just do the best we can .
marketing executive : whoops .
user interface designer : you will have to push it a bit more .
marketing executive : will it manage ? bit more , dear .
user interface designer : this is more than enough .
industrial designer : there we go , i have got a bit more of the cable .
marketing executive : is that ?
user interface designer : you can pull it out now .
marketing executive : just pull it closer a little bit .
industrial designer : you should be able to and
project manager : you might .
industrial designer : there you go .
marketing executive : get it right over , .
project manager : look at that .
marketing executive : i am going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and our starting point with marketing is always market research . , so that is where we started , we used our usability lab , the company is usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross - section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . our findings , lots of findings , i have just summarised some of them here . the overall thing which i have got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but that is quite a high proportion of our , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that is a bit nicer looking . , current remote controls do not match with the operating behaviour of the user overall . , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , so you have got your person sunk back in the sofa channel - hopping . so again there is power implications there . , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we do not have so many functions actually on the remote control . the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier , remote controls are often lost in the room , it is a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , fifty percent were particularly frustrated by that . thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and that ties in with the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just ca not be bothered to learn about the other functions . , slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury . those small movements of the remote control can lead to shoulder and elbow problems . the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid in when they have lost the actual remote control , some speech recognition . something we did not put to them , but which i am thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . , that trend reverses in the older age groups . so thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it reverses , they are not so bothered with this . i had marvellous tables and things that i could show you , but i will just keep it simple , if there is any more information email you extra details ,
user interface designer : that is fine .
project manager : . right , we have new project requirements , we are not going to be using teletext , the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . our control is only going to be for t_v _ , it is not going to be a combined control , which limits all of the different things that it limits the cost for us , but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .
marketing executive :  , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?
project manager : it says for t_v _ only , so looks like it is just
marketing executive : just channel - hopping .
project manager : maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but i , what do you think ? it just said , for t_v _ only . but , general t_v _ controls do video as .
marketing executive : would that imply video use ?
industrial designer : t . i d the w if you have g
project manager : you bu som you get com you get combined t_v _ and videos do not you ?
industrial designer : . if
marketing executive :  , yes .
industrial designer : and if you got a sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the t_v _ anyway so on to like the t_v _ hard drive or so .
project manager : we assume that it is still got play and stop functions and programming .
user interface designer : anything about that on the market research like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?
marketing executive : yes . we did not really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about ten percent of the buttons ,
user interface designer : ten perc
marketing executive : th those do tend to be the basic channel - hopping things and on and off for the video , fast - forwarding , so on and it is general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare
industrial designer : ju just as an idea on the speech recognition thing that pr it would probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing
user interface designer : pens
industrial designer : and they are not that great anyway .
marketing executive : i have just called up that table there ,
industrial designer : alright , .
marketing executive : we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we did not differentiate . would you prefer an l_c_d _ screen , that is multi - function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? so you can see how the yes no varies across the age group there , and a substantial number of do not knows in the older age group , that is just general fear of new technology .
industrial designer : but on that again thought you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it will let off a loud noise to let where it is
project manager : bu
industrial designer : so that could be quite a
marketing executive : right .
project manager : we do have a budget limitation that we ca not control ourselves , so when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing because it is something i it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you do not lose , you were saying whistling ,
industrial designer : .
project manager : maybe on the t_v _ you could put like a pack on the t_v _ so you ca not see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the t_v _ and it beeps and you are like it is over there , something like that ,
marketing executive : that is a super idea .
project manager : but that is that sounds a lot cheaper to me . the third thing was that we have to make the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . so we want logo , we want fashionable , trendy , what you were talking about with the marketing . , people paying more for it to look good . , we need to focus on that as .
marketing executive : yes , further market research will be needed to focus on what that is , it is gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who is sixty and also across the world if we are aiming at the international market . what is attractive to a trendy new yorker and what is attractive to a retired south african , you get the idea . it is it is gonna vary around the world . at the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it is the user interface design that may and th the fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .
user interface designer : so are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ?
industrial designer : y you could have a number of different designs
user interface designer : alright .
industrial designer : inside they would be essentially exactly the same .
user interface designer : right . the features could be same and the body could look slightly different .
industrial designer : just , .
user interface designer : so
project manager : what about you were talking about the buttons , the controls that are coming out now have big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , we got to make it original , what about with the touch screen computers
industrial designer : that is what i was just .
project manager : ? so you it is like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which should not wear out as much either , not about the
industrial designer : you would not have to you do not actually have to press them you just
project manager : you do not have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it . , think that might appeal i am thinking japan , i am thinking young , office people ,
marketing executive : .
project manager : trendy a thing .
marketing executive : yes it will appeal to sections of the market def
project manager : but quite , easily labelled so that anyone can that is obvious what that is for and it is not daunting to maybe the older generations ,
marketing executive :  , .
industrial designer : but also er ergonomics as we are saying with the different designs , ergonomics there is physically different things if you have ever seen the x _ box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan would not buy it because the controller was physically to big
project manager : were too big .
industrial designer : because they are c just generally japanese people have smaller hands so they could not get round the controller which is so if you i what you can have bigger buttons for some countries and smaller ones for others .
user interface designer : maybe to as it was indicated that risk of repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that . so , a bigger b so y you are dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you are desi dividing it according to the countries also , the market . maybe for u_s _ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in japan and all you need to have a small , .
project manager : we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , .
marketing executive : th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , .
project manager : it is gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities , .
marketing executive : i am concerned , when you read the r_s_i _ issue again , repetitive strain injury , i do not think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , that is still a question mark issue how we deal with that . , r_s_i _ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements . i am j i really ca not get my head round this one , this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it is something we should think about .
industrial designer : i was just thinking about how you could combat that without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel
marketing executive : i know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes i know .
industrial designer : and it becomes
project manager : or a speech recognition ,
industrial designer : speech recognition ,
project manager : which is extremely expensive ,
industrial designer : but
project manager : that is the only way that you avoid that issue .
marketing executive : do we have to initially , looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . do we really have to go for everyone right away ?
user interface designer : we could focus on the biggest market . if say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?
industrial designer : ge
marketing executive : and when we have been throwing up our ideas we are automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people .
project manager : we are we are talking about the type of company that we are working for as . that they want it to be fashionable , they want it to be trendy and you would not automatically assume associate that with the older generations . now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people , but i do not think we are focusing on that , we are focusing on a mid - range , business class type people .
marketing executive : i am just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the broad scale marketing stage , we want to , not waste money , not be profligate and focus on where the idea will be taken up , first it is most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .
project manager : so the remote control functions . we have got the t_v _ , we have got the video , now there is i ca not remember what it is called , the little code at the end of programme details ,
industrial designer : video plus .
project manager : yes . we could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that i always found that really easy when i discovered it , because you have got your general record anyway so if you there is a programme on you want to put record on , that is fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you are not if you are going to , you put the number in
industrial designer : just whack in the number .
project manager : and it is just a number , it is not a date , it is not a time , it is not a channel , it is not when it finishes , it is not anything like that ,
industrial designer : and you w
project manager : it is just a number .
industrial designer : and you would not need a whole host of extra buttons for that ,
project manager : no .
industrial designer : you just need one you have already got all the numbers there anyway ,
project manager : you have already got the numbers for typing in anyway .
marketing executive : i have not come across that function but it sounds wonderful .
project manager : it is after if you look in the newspaper , t_v _ guide or any t_v _ guide there is a five , six digit number afterwards
industrial designer : it is not
project manager : and that is the number you put in and it is recorded that it is going to be on tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth so you do not have to worry about dates and you do not have to worry about times , and it has been around for quite a long time .
industrial designer : it is been around for a long time it is just it is not very advertised as to how to use it and things .
project manager : no it is not but if awareness was brought to the forefront about that
marketing executive : superb .
industrial designer : though if y if you have got something like sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it will record that programme when it is on and you press it on it twice and it will record the whole series .
marketing executive : excellent ,  .
industrial designer : so that . but just to have that function would be really good .
project manager : so
marketing executive : can run this past you while it occurs to me , i do not mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that is what led us on to comparing t_v _ remote controls with their design features , chain companies like carphone warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you have got any problems with it and they will fix it , they will phone the company , you can use their telephones . is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th , which button is it i press for this ? th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?
industrial designer : but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they the companies who you deal with have actually they have got an obligation to help you out and also it is fair enough to have some help service but i am not how much the cost would be of having
project manager : the functionality of it in the sense that you are sitting there , you are pressing this button and your t_v _ is not doing it . taking your t_v _ and your control and saying look this is what i am doing , it is not working , what should i do ?
marketing executive : alright . yes if it was something as simple as you could not change the channel , but for if there were any more or are we definite it is only gonna be for t_v _ and video ,
project manager : so .
industrial designer :
marketing executive : we are not gonna put any , just a thought .
industrial designer : instru instruction books i feel c i reckon can cover that .
project manager : instruction manuals . but they are there is customer service , there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to
industrial designer : department , .
project manager : and that way there is no call out charge , there is no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , .
user interface designer : it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .
industrial designer : and they are
marketing executive : not for such simple functions
industrial designer : they should be f .
marketing executive : because we are focusing on that ,
project manager : but we should focus on making the manual as user - friendly as possible
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : simple .
project manager : because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots of pages .
marketing executive : puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes .
project manager : it does ,
industrial designer : it is the
project manager : you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about . , what other functions ? we need i am not if we need a design decision now , but we should think about c you have got the dilemma between batteries , that is what i was thinking about . mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ?
industrial designer : they are specially made for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , you could bundle a charger in with it but
project manager : they la they last quite a long time ,
industrial designer :  .
project manager : and if you had when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you are not using it or t at night , but it does not really matter it never really runs out it lasts a long time once it is charged . , something like that should reduce the size of it .
industrial designer : and if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could
project manager : it could be on that , .
industrial designer : on that as so .
user interface designer : so are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?
project manager : s yes .
industrial designer : some docking station or
project manager : rechargeable with a docking station . so the rechargeable which would be your field .
industrial designer : th that would be fine , and also that would mean they would not have to go out buying batteries all the time .
project manager : yes , which it is cheaper in the long run as . , th the shape you got trendy . i do not wanna big box with lots of things , you do not want a tiny little thing either , because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple ,
marketing executive : and we do not w so many remote controls look identical ,
project manager : they do .
marketing executive : these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . we definitely an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we do not want that .
project manager : so we have got a flip - screen .
user interface designer : what i was thinking of a design which nokia h came up with almost six or seven years back . we have a flat one it looks like a box , like a chocolate . that is very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , and you do not have to you do not bend your thumb too much , so it is like you can say a banana shape thing , curled up like a boat .
marketing executive : slightly curved , curved .
user interface designer : g so what happens is you do not have to press your thumb too down like . so it is already curled up so your thumb does not
project manager : it is moulded to your hand anyway .
user interface designer : y so we can have a s like moulded according to your the way you h hold of it is semi - circular in the bottom , something like that . i would not say exactly semi - circular but smooth .
project manager : can you look into the company logo ? , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product .
user interface designer : current .
project manager : if it was a c _ like that , you could have it in a vague c _ shape that opens up like a shell ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite into the design , while also making it quite different from anything else that is there .
user interface designer : we could look in at that but . what we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea - shells ,
marketing executive : look at the mobile .
user interface designer : logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of the model , rather than , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like .
project manager : we need to think about how it is gonna look different .
marketing executive : that is that sounds a really attractive idea ,
user interface designer : a sea shell ?
marketing executive : i have not come across anything like that before , if it and that opens out into your flip - top . then it is t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you are having to actually insert in between the two covers , that is gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that i would think . it is a really idea
user interface designer : we could look in at that .
marketing executive : and plus you can get even though we are using plastic , you can still think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a conch shell or scallop shell exterior .
project manager : or you could do different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . you could have different casings . so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and
marketing executive : less chance of it being lost too , it is not like a chocolate brown lozenge that is gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a ornament they do not not gonna lose it so much either . it is easier to bit to handle .
user interface designer : maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , that could be the most common design . but we can like think of five , six designs .
project manager : right , we have to round it up ,
marketing executive : can quickly go over the new project requirements so that i have not missed anything . so it is no teletext , it is only for t_v _ and by implication video , our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , something about videoplus .
project manager : that was in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date
marketing executive : right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the l_c_d _ , a reminder about using videoplus ? so that they have a look at the guide and or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just that was an add - on feature ?
project manager : it is kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that .
marketing executive : right , so it is doing away with the programming feature ?
project manager : it could be it c it yes , it could be adv advertisement feature , rather than design feature , drawing attention to that . and it also paid lip service in the instruction manual , it is very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful .
marketing executive : and the rechargeable batteries . was there anything else there that we in the new project requirements ?
project manager : we have got the buttons but we will work through that with the design of it , .
marketing executive : that is not at the moment a requirement , it is something we are looking at ,
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like .
project manager : and we have talked about there being an alarm , a beeping for being lost , .
user interface designer : for detection , right .
project manager : learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . but there are not gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the i the instruction manual , i if we deal with that , . and different from what is out there .
user interface designer : true .
marketing executive : what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? or shall generally look the issues involved ?
project manager : you might get guidance , but i th instruction manuals , there tends to be a demonised thing , u , they are everyone is got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them .
marketing executive : whoops , questionnaire four .
user interface designer : we should f
project manager : yes , right .
user interface designer : it is time for us to get back to
marketing executive : we are at lunchtime now .
project manager : you can email me , if there is any more questions . and i will be able to not answer them .","the industrial designer gave his presentation on the basic functions of the remote . he presented the basic components that remotes share and suggested that smaller batteries be considered in the product design . the user interface designer presented his ideas for making the remote easy-to-use; he discussed using a simple design and hiding complicated features from the main interface . the marketing expert presented the findings from a lab study on user requirements for a remote control device , and discussed users' demand for a simple interface and advanced technology . the project manager presented the new requirements that the remote not include a teletext function , that it be used only to control television , and that it include the company image in its design . the group narrowed down their target marketing group to the youth market . they discussed the functions the remote will have , including video plus capability and rechargeable batteries . a customer service plan was suggested to make the remote seem more user-friendly , but it was decided that helpful manuals were more within the budget . the group then discussed the shell-like shape of the remote and including several different casing options to buyers . the marketing expert will research consumers' opinions on instruction manuals . it was decided that the group will produce one product design instead of creating alternate designs in an attempt to accomodate different users' preferences . the marketing will be focused towards a young , business-class buyer . the remote will feature video plus capabilities and a seashell-like shape to accomodate the lcd display and the flip screen . the remote will be bundled with a docking station to recharge the remote's batteries and a user-friendly instruction manual , and multiple casings will be made available . the limitations of the budget will restrict the development of some features; several of the features that the group wanted to include may have to be made simpler to decrease cost .
","the project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting . the industrial designer presented the working design that will appear in the prototype , and discussed the size and shape of the device . the user interface designer discussed what features the remote was required to have and presented two existing products which were based on different concepts . the marketing expert discussed his marketing strategy for the project and the group discussed several product features they could include in the design of the remote . the program manager asked the group about their target group . the group decided that the target group would be people aged fifteen to thirty five . the power source will be triple a alkaline batteries . the remote will have a flip-open design . the device will be small and easy to carry . the display will be black with a yellow glow-in-the-dark material . the corporate logo will be displayed on the remote , along with the slogan ""America's Choice"". the group had a discussion to decide on the features that will be incorporated into the design . they decided to include a battery charging stand , to use a special chip , and to not include a recharger with a locator function . the meeting was adjourned . the product will be sold for twenty five euros with a profit aim of fifty million euros . the company will not pay any attention to the product evaluation . the groups were satisfied with the prototype but felt it was too small and cumbersome to be fashionable . *na* the group would like to incorporate a recharging",X,,,X,,,X,,5.0,BART-Cons
8,"project manager : help . it is up there ? that screen is black . , that is fine .
marketing executive : god .
project manager : are we done ? right , this is our second meeting and i might be a bit all over the place . , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ?
marketing executive : no that is ,
project manager : i will go over what we decided last meeting ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , t_v _ , video equipment . , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . we decided it was important to reflect the company is image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , that s thing . , our budget would have to affect try not to reflect our budget , that we might have a bit of you can see it , . dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . we discussed a flip - open design , reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming , things like that . , three presentations , i have got written here so shall we hear from marketing first ?
marketing executive : is it if i postpone that til later , want to get access to a little bit more information ,
project manager : no that is fine , that is fine .
marketing executive : is that ?
industrial designer : i will go first . can i grab the
project manager : unplug me .
industrial designer : what do i have to press ?
project manager : f_n _ function f _ eight .
industrial designer : right , . maybe there we go . this is the working design , presented by me , the industrial designer extraordinaire . , this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so . what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design ? , a device which just sends the signal to the t_v _ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel or the volume , everything is just some signal to change the state of the t_v _ or other appliance that it is sending the signal to . , so i decided i would have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . but although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make that our design stands out and that was something that it was not really my area because i am dealing with the inside really . so , i ran out of time so i could not do this one as fun as the last one . and i found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t_v _ presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you do not need to send very much information . , most of them are powered by some form of battery . now our one , i am not whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a _ batteries but those can be quite bulky so i d i did not know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control .
marketing executive :  . could i interject to ask a question there ,
project manager :  .
marketing executive : is that appropriate ? you are saying the triple a _ batteries are small or the surrounding it ?
industrial designer : no , if you look at most remote controls they are quite chunky and that is because of the size of the batteries , they have to be this certain size to fit those batteries in .
marketing executive : right , the triple a_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?
industrial designer : the
project manager : they are .
industrial designer : you can get the circular round ones but i am just wondering about power consumption
marketing executive : i see .
industrial designer : and how much you need to send the data across . , and d which leads onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . , now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . now the main components i came up with were the power source for the batteries otherwise it is not gonna work , as i said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can discuss that later and then you need something to decode the information that you are putting in from the controller now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is suitable for anyone who is watching the t_v _ unless they are in a cinema , which not most people do so as we are applying to the most audience that should be fine . and then i was just had a quick look at the external design but i d i left that mostly to the interface designer . and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wanna do . it is not a proper circuit , i am not if it would work or not , i am not even confident that those are the real way you would wire it up but anyway , we have just got the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the u_i _ interface which would , when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i_r _ data which could be decoded by the t_v _ receiver , which means that we are gonna have to conform to whatever form of communication that the t_v_s are already using and since that is another use and reason to use that infrared because that is what all t_v_s use at the moment . and then finally , we want the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that i have put forward are low in cost so that should be good . it should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about , because they are small they are also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti - going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , i th that was just a general point there .
marketing executive : that is a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so refer to that , whenever you like me to present .
industrial designer : alright , and , that is what i came up with there ,
project manager : very much .
industrial designer : so if you wanna
project manager : would you like to continue on from that ?
user interface designer : it can be
project manager : or , maybe move the laptop over .
user interface designer : that is with me . why is it not working ? f _ eight , right ?
project manager : f _ function .
industrial designer : function f _ eight .
user interface designer : why is it in the right ?
marketing executive : no . the plug has not come out at the bottom , has it ?
user interface designer : it is connecting .
industrial designer : no , no it is just .
marketing executive : meter adjusting .
project manager : there .
user interface designer : . actually some of my points might overlap with what william is just mention , but my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which we will take a feedback from the marketing because , i have not had some marketing data and every product is marketable . so purpose , as william already said , i would put it to simplify the interaction with t_v _ to make it as simple as possible . and to summarise i would say it is it should be user - friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . but we are to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together . so what the concept is to have a flip - top model . the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip - top . so it is like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of audience and we can punch in new f features such as added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . findings most people prefer us user - friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year and they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it is not of no use of punching in the trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . as we saw we have to make a profit also so we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production by fifty million we said ? , with that we will be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . , that is so this is if you ask me personally , i would make flip - top with a trendy design and s maybe we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use usage and all that . so in overall a simple and user - friendly design . any comments like , if you want ?
project manager : we will chat about it at the end , so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , it is vibrating , that is strange .
user interface designer : you will have to
marketing executive : have i got to keep this here ?
user interface designer : you ca not
marketing executive : does it matter ?
user interface designer : it will have to this ca not be pulled .
marketing executive : i will have t i will have to move it wo not i ?
project manager : we just do the best we can .
marketing executive : whoops .
user interface designer : you will have to push it a bit more .
marketing executive : will it manage ? bit more , dear .
user interface designer : this is more than enough .
industrial designer : there we go , i have got a bit more of the cable .
marketing executive : is that ?
user interface designer : you can pull it out now .
marketing executive : just pull it closer a little bit .
industrial designer : you should be able to and
project manager : you might .
industrial designer : there you go .
marketing executive : get it right over , .
project manager : look at that .
marketing executive : i am going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and our starting point with marketing is always market research . , so that is where we started , we used our usability lab , the company is usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross - section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . our findings , lots of findings , i have just summarised some of them here . the overall thing which i have got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but that is quite a high proportion of our , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that is a bit nicer looking . , current remote controls do not match with the operating behaviour of the user overall . , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , so you have got your person sunk back in the sofa channel - hopping . so again there is power implications there . , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we do not have so many functions actually on the remote control . the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier , remote controls are often lost in the room , it is a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , fifty percent were particularly frustrated by that . thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and that ties in with the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just ca not be bothered to learn about the other functions . , slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury . those small movements of the remote control can lead to shoulder and elbow problems . the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid in when they have lost the actual remote control , some speech recognition . something we did not put to them , but which i am thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . , that trend reverses in the older age groups . so thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it reverses , they are not so bothered with this . i had marvellous tables and things that i could show you , but i will just keep it simple , if there is any more information email you extra details ,
user interface designer : that is fine .
project manager : . right , we have new project requirements , we are not going to be using teletext , the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . our control is only going to be for t_v _ , it is not going to be a combined control , which limits all of the different things that it limits the cost for us , but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .
marketing executive :  , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?
project manager : it says for t_v _ only , so looks like it is just
marketing executive : just channel - hopping .
project manager : maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but i , what do you think ? it just said , for t_v _ only . but , general t_v _ controls do video as .
marketing executive : would that imply video use ?
industrial designer : t . i d the w if you have g
project manager : you bu som you get com you get combined t_v _ and videos do not you ?
industrial designer : . if
marketing executive :  , yes .
industrial designer : and if you got a sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the t_v _ anyway so on to like the t_v _ hard drive or so .
project manager : we assume that it is still got play and stop functions and programming .
user interface designer : anything about that on the market research like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?
marketing executive : yes . we did not really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about ten percent of the buttons ,
user interface designer : ten perc
marketing executive : th those do tend to be the basic channel - hopping things and on and off for the video , fast - forwarding , so on and it is general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare
industrial designer : ju just as an idea on the speech recognition thing that pr it would probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing
user interface designer : pens
industrial designer : and they are not that great anyway .
marketing executive : i have just called up that table there ,
industrial designer : alright , .
marketing executive : we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we did not differentiate . would you prefer an l_c_d _ screen , that is multi - function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? so you can see how the yes no varies across the age group there , and a substantial number of do not knows in the older age group , that is just general fear of new technology .
industrial designer : but on that again thought you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it will let off a loud noise to let where it is
project manager : bu
industrial designer : so that could be quite a
marketing executive : right .
project manager : we do have a budget limitation that we ca not control ourselves , so when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing because it is something i it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you do not lose , you were saying whistling ,
industrial designer : .
project manager : maybe on the t_v _ you could put like a pack on the t_v _ so you ca not see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the t_v _ and it beeps and you are like it is over there , something like that ,
marketing executive : that is a super idea .
project manager : but that is that sounds a lot cheaper to me . the third thing was that we have to make the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . so we want logo , we want fashionable , trendy , what you were talking about with the marketing . , people paying more for it to look good . , we need to focus on that as .
marketing executive : yes , further market research will be needed to focus on what that is , it is gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who is sixty and also across the world if we are aiming at the international market . what is attractive to a trendy new yorker and what is attractive to a retired south african , you get the idea . it is it is gonna vary around the world . at the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it is the user interface design that may and th the fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .
user interface designer : so are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ?
industrial designer : y you could have a number of different designs
user interface designer : alright .
industrial designer : inside they would be essentially exactly the same .
user interface designer : right . the features could be same and the body could look slightly different .
industrial designer : just , .
user interface designer : so
project manager : what about you were talking about the buttons , the controls that are coming out now have big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , we got to make it original , what about with the touch screen computers
industrial designer : that is what i was just .
project manager : ? so you it is like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which should not wear out as much either , not about the
industrial designer : you would not have to you do not actually have to press them you just
project manager : you do not have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it . , think that might appeal i am thinking japan , i am thinking young , office people ,
marketing executive : .
project manager : trendy a thing .
marketing executive : yes it will appeal to sections of the market def
project manager : but quite , easily labelled so that anyone can that is obvious what that is for and it is not daunting to maybe the older generations ,
marketing executive :  , .
industrial designer : but also er ergonomics as we are saying with the different designs , ergonomics there is physically different things if you have ever seen the x _ box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan would not buy it because the controller was physically to big
project manager : were too big .
industrial designer : because they are c just generally japanese people have smaller hands so they could not get round the controller which is so if you i what you can have bigger buttons for some countries and smaller ones for others .
user interface designer : maybe to as it was indicated that risk of repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that . so , a bigger b so y you are dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you are desi dividing it according to the countries also , the market . maybe for u_s _ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in japan and all you need to have a small , .
project manager : we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , .
marketing executive : th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , .
project manager : it is gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities , .
marketing executive : i am concerned , when you read the r_s_i _ issue again , repetitive strain injury , i do not think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , that is still a question mark issue how we deal with that . , r_s_i _ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements . i am j i really ca not get my head round this one , this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it is something we should think about .
industrial designer : i was just thinking about how you could combat that without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel
marketing executive : i know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes i know .
industrial designer : and it becomes
project manager : or a speech recognition ,
industrial designer : speech recognition ,
project manager : which is extremely expensive ,
industrial designer : but
project manager : that is the only way that you avoid that issue .
marketing executive : do we have to initially , looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . do we really have to go for everyone right away ?
user interface designer : we could focus on the biggest market . if say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?
industrial designer : ge
marketing executive : and when we have been throwing up our ideas we are automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people .
project manager : we are we are talking about the type of company that we are working for as . that they want it to be fashionable , they want it to be trendy and you would not automatically assume associate that with the older generations . now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people , but i do not think we are focusing on that , we are focusing on a mid - range , business class type people .
marketing executive : i am just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the broad scale marketing stage , we want to , not waste money , not be profligate and focus on where the idea will be taken up , first it is most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .
project manager : so the remote control functions . we have got the t_v _ , we have got the video , now there is i ca not remember what it is called , the little code at the end of programme details ,
industrial designer : video plus .
project manager : yes . we could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that i always found that really easy when i discovered it , because you have got your general record anyway so if you there is a programme on you want to put record on , that is fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you are not if you are going to , you put the number in
industrial designer : just whack in the number .
project manager : and it is just a number , it is not a date , it is not a time , it is not a channel , it is not when it finishes , it is not anything like that ,
industrial designer : and you w
project manager : it is just a number .
industrial designer : and you would not need a whole host of extra buttons for that ,
project manager : no .
industrial designer : you just need one you have already got all the numbers there anyway ,
project manager : you have already got the numbers for typing in anyway .
marketing executive : i have not come across that function but it sounds wonderful .
project manager : it is after if you look in the newspaper , t_v _ guide or any t_v _ guide there is a five , six digit number afterwards
industrial designer : it is not
project manager : and that is the number you put in and it is recorded that it is going to be on tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth so you do not have to worry about dates and you do not have to worry about times , and it has been around for quite a long time .
industrial designer : it is been around for a long time it is just it is not very advertised as to how to use it and things .
project manager : no it is not but if awareness was brought to the forefront about that
marketing executive : superb .
industrial designer : though if y if you have got something like sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it will record that programme when it is on and you press it on it twice and it will record the whole series .
marketing executive : excellent ,  .
industrial designer : so that . but just to have that function would be really good .
project manager : so
marketing executive : can run this past you while it occurs to me , i do not mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that is what led us on to comparing t_v _ remote controls with their design features , chain companies like carphone warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you have got any problems with it and they will fix it , they will phone the company , you can use their telephones . is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th , which button is it i press for this ? th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?
industrial designer : but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they the companies who you deal with have actually they have got an obligation to help you out and also it is fair enough to have some help service but i am not how much the cost would be of having
project manager : the functionality of it in the sense that you are sitting there , you are pressing this button and your t_v _ is not doing it . taking your t_v _ and your control and saying look this is what i am doing , it is not working , what should i do ?
marketing executive : alright . yes if it was something as simple as you could not change the channel , but for if there were any more or are we definite it is only gonna be for t_v _ and video ,
project manager : so .
industrial designer :
marketing executive : we are not gonna put any , just a thought .
industrial designer : instru instruction books i feel c i reckon can cover that .
project manager : instruction manuals . but they are there is customer service , there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to
industrial designer : department , .
project manager : and that way there is no call out charge , there is no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , .
user interface designer : it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .
industrial designer : and they are
marketing executive : not for such simple functions
industrial designer : they should be f .
marketing executive : because we are focusing on that ,
project manager : but we should focus on making the manual as user - friendly as possible
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : simple .
project manager : because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots of pages .
marketing executive : puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes .
project manager : it does ,
industrial designer : it is the
project manager : you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about . , what other functions ? we need i am not if we need a design decision now , but we should think about c you have got the dilemma between batteries , that is what i was thinking about . mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ?
industrial designer : they are specially made for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , you could bundle a charger in with it but
project manager : they la they last quite a long time ,
industrial designer :  .
project manager : and if you had when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you are not using it or t at night , but it does not really matter it never really runs out it lasts a long time once it is charged . , something like that should reduce the size of it .
industrial designer : and if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could
project manager : it could be on that , .
industrial designer : on that as so .
user interface designer : so are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?
project manager : s yes .
industrial designer : some docking station or
project manager : rechargeable with a docking station . so the rechargeable which would be your field .
industrial designer : th that would be fine , and also that would mean they would not have to go out buying batteries all the time .
project manager : yes , which it is cheaper in the long run as . , th the shape you got trendy . i do not wanna big box with lots of things , you do not want a tiny little thing either , because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple ,
marketing executive : and we do not w so many remote controls look identical ,
project manager : they do .
marketing executive : these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . we definitely an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we do not want that .
project manager : so we have got a flip - screen .
user interface designer : what i was thinking of a design which nokia h came up with almost six or seven years back . we have a flat one it looks like a box , like a chocolate . that is very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , and you do not have to you do not bend your thumb too much , so it is like you can say a banana shape thing , curled up like a boat .
marketing executive : slightly curved , curved .
user interface designer : g so what happens is you do not have to press your thumb too down like . so it is already curled up so your thumb does not
project manager : it is moulded to your hand anyway .
user interface designer : y so we can have a s like moulded according to your the way you h hold of it is semi - circular in the bottom , something like that . i would not say exactly semi - circular but smooth .
project manager : can you look into the company logo ? , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product .
user interface designer : current .
project manager : if it was a c _ like that , you could have it in a vague c _ shape that opens up like a shell ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite into the design , while also making it quite different from anything else that is there .
user interface designer : we could look in at that but . what we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea - shells ,
marketing executive : look at the mobile .
user interface designer : logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of the model , rather than , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like .
project manager : we need to think about how it is gonna look different .
marketing executive : that is that sounds a really attractive idea ,
user interface designer : a sea shell ?
marketing executive : i have not come across anything like that before , if it and that opens out into your flip - top . then it is t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you are having to actually insert in between the two covers , that is gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that i would think . it is a really idea
user interface designer : we could look in at that .
marketing executive : and plus you can get even though we are using plastic , you can still think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a conch shell or scallop shell exterior .
project manager : or you could do different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . you could have different casings . so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and
marketing executive : less chance of it being lost too , it is not like a chocolate brown lozenge that is gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a ornament they do not not gonna lose it so much either . it is easier to bit to handle .
user interface designer : maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , that could be the most common design . but we can like think of five , six designs .
project manager : right , we have to round it up ,
marketing executive : can quickly go over the new project requirements so that i have not missed anything . so it is no teletext , it is only for t_v _ and by implication video , our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , something about videoplus .
project manager : that was in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date
marketing executive : right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the l_c_d _ , a reminder about using videoplus ? so that they have a look at the guide and or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just that was an add - on feature ?
project manager : it is kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that .
marketing executive : right , so it is doing away with the programming feature ?
project manager : it could be it c it yes , it could be adv advertisement feature , rather than design feature , drawing attention to that . and it also paid lip service in the instruction manual , it is very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful .
marketing executive : and the rechargeable batteries . was there anything else there that we in the new project requirements ?
project manager : we have got the buttons but we will work through that with the design of it , .
marketing executive : that is not at the moment a requirement , it is something we are looking at ,
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like .
project manager : and we have talked about there being an alarm , a beeping for being lost , .
user interface designer : for detection , right .
project manager : learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . but there are not gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the i the instruction manual , i if we deal with that , . and different from what is out there .
user interface designer : true .
marketing executive : what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? or shall generally look the issues involved ?
project manager : you might get guidance , but i th instruction manuals , there tends to be a demonised thing , u , they are everyone is got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them .
marketing executive : whoops , questionnaire four .
user interface designer : we should f
project manager : yes , right .
user interface designer : it is time for us to get back to
marketing executive : we are at lunchtime now .
project manager : you can email me , if there is any more questions . and i will be able to not answer them .","the industrial designer gave his presentation on the basic functions of the remote . he presented the basic components that remotes share and suggested that smaller batteries be considered in the product design . the user interface designer presented his ideas for making the remote easy-to-use; he discussed using a simple design and hiding complicated features from the main interface . the marketing expert presented the findings from a lab study on user requirements for a remote control device , and discussed users' demand for a simple interface and advanced technology . the project manager presented the new requirements that the remote not include a teletext function , that it be used only to control television , and that it include the company image in its design . the group narrowed down their target marketing group to the youth market . they discussed the functions the remote will have , including video plus capability and rechargeable batteries . a customer service plan was suggested to make the remote seem more user-friendly , but it was decided that helpful manuals were more within the budget . the group then discussed the shell-like shape of the remote and including several different casing options to buyers . the marketing expert will research consumers' opinions on instruction manuals . it was decided that the group will produce one product design instead of creating alternate designs in an attempt to accomodate different users' preferences . the marketing will be focused towards a young , business-class buyer . the remote will feature video plus capabilities and a seashell-like shape to accomodate the lcd display and the flip screen . the remote will be bundled with a docking station to recharge the remote's batteries and a user-friendly instruction manual , and multiple casings will be made available . the limitations of the budget will restrict the development of some features; several of the features that the group wanted to include may have to be made simpler to decrease cost .
","the project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and briefed the team on some new requirements to abide by when designing the remote . the user interface designer presented two existing products and discussed what features the team should retain in order to maintain their target demographic . the marketing expert discussed the results of trend-watching reports and the team discussed the following features in terms of appearance and functionality: universal capability , one remote for all devices , and a touch-screen interface . the industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the team discussed the option to include a charging stand with the remote . the team then discussed what components , materials , and energy sources to use . the industrial designer will work on the look and feel of the design . the user interface designer will work on the user interface design . the marketing expert will work on the product evaluation the remote will use triple batteries . the remote will not feature a touch screen interface . the remote will use conventional batteries . the corporate image must be recognizable in the design of the remote . the remote will have a square shape . the remote will not feature a charging stand . the remote will use an advanced chip-on-print . cost of components . whether to include a charging stand with the remote . whether to include a scroll wheel for the remote . whether to have a touch screen interface . whether to",X,,,X,,,,,6.0,Pegasus-Cons

marketing executive : god .
project manager : are we done ? right , this is our second meeting and i might be a bit all over the place . , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ?
marketing executive : no that is ,
project manager : i will go over what we decided last meeting ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , t_v _ , video equipment . , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . we decided it was important to reflect the company is image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , that s thing . , our budget would have to affect try not to reflect our budget , that we might have a bit of you can see it , . dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . we discussed a flip - open design , reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming , things like that . , three presentations , i have got written here so shall we hear from marketing first ?
marketing executive : is it if i postpone that til later , want to get access to a little bit more information ,
project manager : no that is fine , that is fine .
marketing executive : is that ?
industrial designer : i will go first . can i grab the
project manager : unplug me .
industrial designer : what do i have to press ?
project manager : f_n _ function f _ eight .
industrial designer : right , . maybe there we go . this is the working design , presented by me , the industrial designer extraordinaire . , this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so . what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design ? , a device which just sends the signal to the t_v _ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel or the volume , everything is just some signal to change the state of the t_v _ or other appliance that it is sending the signal to . , so i decided i would have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . but although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make that our design stands out and that was something that it was not really my area because i am dealing with the inside really . so , i ran out of time so i could not do this one as fun as the last one . and i found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t_v _ presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you do not need to send very much information . , most of them are powered by some form of battery . now our one , i am not whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a _ batteries but those can be quite bulky so i d i did not know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control .
marketing executive :  . could i interject to ask a question there ,
project manager :  .
marketing executive : is that appropriate ? you are saying the triple a _ batteries are small or the surrounding it ?
industrial designer : no , if you look at most remote controls they are quite chunky and that is because of the size of the batteries , they have to be this certain size to fit those batteries in .
marketing executive : right , the triple a_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?
industrial designer : the
project manager : they are .
industrial designer : you can get the circular round ones but i am just wondering about power consumption
marketing executive : i see .
industrial designer : and how much you need to send the data across . , and d which leads onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . , now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . now the main components i came up with were the power source for the batteries otherwise it is not gonna work , as i said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can discuss that later and then you need something to decode the information that you are putting in from the controller now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is suitable for anyone who is watching the t_v _ unless they are in a cinema , which not most people do so as we are applying to the most audience that should be fine . and then i was just had a quick look at the external design but i d i left that mostly to the interface designer . and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wanna do . it is not a proper circuit , i am not if it would work or not , i am not even confident that those are the real way you would wire it up but anyway , we have just got the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the u_i _ interface which would , when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i_r _ data which could be decoded by the t_v _ receiver , which means that we are gonna have to conform to whatever form of communication that the t_v_s are already using and since that is another use and reason to use that infrared because that is what all t_v_s use at the moment . and then finally , we want the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that i have put forward are low in cost so that should be good . it should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about , because they are small they are also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti - going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , i th that was just a general point there .
marketing executive : that is a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so refer to that , whenever you like me to present .
industrial designer : alright , and , that is what i came up with there ,
project manager : very much .
industrial designer : so if you wanna
project manager : would you like to continue on from that ?
user interface designer : it can be
project manager : or , maybe move the laptop over .
user interface designer : that is with me . why is it not working ? f _ eight , right ?
project manager : f _ function .
industrial designer : function f _ eight .
user interface designer : why is it in the right ?
marketing executive : no . the plug has not come out at the bottom , has it ?
user interface designer : it is connecting .
industrial designer : no , no it is just .
marketing executive : meter adjusting .
project manager : there .
user interface designer : . actually some of my points might overlap with what william is just mention , but my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which we will take a feedback from the marketing because , i have not had some marketing data and every product is marketable . so purpose , as william already said , i would put it to simplify the interaction with t_v _ to make it as simple as possible . and to summarise i would say it is it should be user - friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . but we are to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together . so what the concept is to have a flip - top model . the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip - top . so it is like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of audience and we can punch in new f features such as added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . findings most people prefer us user - friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year and they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it is not of no use of punching in the trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . as we saw we have to make a profit also so we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production by fifty million we said ? , with that we will be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . , that is so this is if you ask me personally , i would make flip - top with a trendy design and s maybe we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use usage and all that . so in overall a simple and user - friendly design . any comments like , if you want ?
project manager : we will chat about it at the end , so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , it is vibrating , that is strange .
user interface designer : you will have to
marketing executive : have i got to keep this here ?
user interface designer : you ca not
marketing executive : does it matter ?
user interface designer : it will have to this ca not be pulled .
marketing executive : i will have t i will have to move it wo not i ?
project manager : we just do the best we can .
marketing executive : whoops .
user interface designer : you will have to push it a bit more .
marketing executive : will it manage ? bit more , dear .
user interface designer : this is more than enough .
industrial designer : there we go , i have got a bit more of the cable .
marketing executive : is that ?
user interface designer : you can pull it out now .
marketing executive : just pull it closer a little bit .
industrial designer : you should be able to and
project manager : you might .
industrial designer : there you go .
marketing executive : get it right over , .
project manager : look at that .
marketing executive : i am going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and our starting point with marketing is always market research . , so that is where we started , we used our usability lab , the company is usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross - section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . our findings , lots of findings , i have just summarised some of them here . the overall thing which i have got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but that is quite a high proportion of our , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that is a bit nicer looking . , current remote controls do not match with the operating behaviour of the user overall . , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , so you have got your person sunk back in the sofa channel - hopping . so again there is power implications there . , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we do not have so many functions actually on the remote control . the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier , remote controls are often lost in the room , it is a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , fifty percent were particularly frustrated by that . thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and that ties in with the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just ca not be bothered to learn about the other functions . , slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury . those small movements of the remote control can lead to shoulder and elbow problems . the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid in when they have lost the actual remote control , some speech recognition . something we did not put to them , but which i am thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . , that trend reverses in the older age groups . so thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it reverses , they are not so bothered with this . i had marvellous tables and things that i could show you , but i will just keep it simple , if there is any more information email you extra details ,
user interface designer : that is fine .
project manager : . right , we have new project requirements , we are not going to be using teletext , the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . our control is only going to be for t_v _ , it is not going to be a combined control , which limits all of the different things that it limits the cost for us , but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .
marketing executive :  , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?
project manager : it says for t_v _ only , so looks like it is just
marketing executive : just channel - hopping .
project manager : maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but i , what do you think ? it just said , for t_v _ only . but , general t_v _ controls do video as .
marketing executive : would that imply video use ?
industrial designer : t . i d the w if you have g
project manager : you bu som you get com you get combined t_v _ and videos do not you ?
industrial designer : . if
marketing executive :  , yes .
industrial designer : and if you got a sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the t_v _ anyway so on to like the t_v _ hard drive or so .
project manager : we assume that it is still got play and stop functions and programming .
user interface designer : anything about that on the market research like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?
marketing executive : yes . we did not really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about ten percent of the buttons ,
user interface designer : ten perc
marketing executive : th those do tend to be the basic channel - hopping things and on and off for the video , fast - forwarding , so on and it is general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare
industrial designer : ju just as an idea on the speech recognition thing that pr it would probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing
user interface designer : pens
industrial designer : and they are not that great anyway .
marketing executive : i have just called up that table there ,
industrial designer : alright , .
marketing executive : we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we did not differentiate . would you prefer an l_c_d _ screen , that is multi - function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? so you can see how the yes no varies across the age group there , and a substantial number of do not knows in the older age group , that is just general fear of new technology .
industrial designer : but on that again thought you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it will let off a loud noise to let where it is
project manager : bu
industrial designer : so that could be quite a
marketing executive : right .
project manager : we do have a budget limitation that we ca not control ourselves , so when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing because it is something i it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you do not lose , you were saying whistling ,
industrial designer : .
project manager : maybe on the t_v _ you could put like a pack on the t_v _ so you ca not see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the t_v _ and it beeps and you are like it is over there , something like that ,
marketing executive : that is a super idea .
project manager : but that is that sounds a lot cheaper to me . the third thing was that we have to make the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . so we want logo , we want fashionable , trendy , what you were talking about with the marketing . , people paying more for it to look good . , we need to focus on that as .
marketing executive : yes , further market research will be needed to focus on what that is , it is gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who is sixty and also across the world if we are aiming at the international market . what is attractive to a trendy new yorker and what is attractive to a retired south african , you get the idea . it is it is gonna vary around the world . at the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it is the user interface design that may and th the fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .
user interface designer : so are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ?
industrial designer : y you could have a number of different designs
user interface designer : alright .
industrial designer : inside they would be essentially exactly the same .
user interface designer : right . the features could be same and the body could look slightly different .
industrial designer : just , .
user interface designer : so
project manager : what about you were talking about the buttons , the controls that are coming out now have big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , we got to make it original , what about with the touch screen computers
industrial designer : that is what i was just .
project manager : ? so you it is like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which should not wear out as much either , not about the
industrial designer : you would not have to you do not actually have to press them you just
project manager : you do not have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it . , think that might appeal i am thinking japan , i am thinking young , office people ,
marketing executive : .
project manager : trendy a thing .
marketing executive : yes it will appeal to sections of the market def
project manager : but quite , easily labelled so that anyone can that is obvious what that is for and it is not daunting to maybe the older generations ,
marketing executive :  , .
industrial designer : but also er ergonomics as we are saying with the different designs , ergonomics there is physically different things if you have ever seen the x _ box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan would not buy it because the controller was physically to big
project manager : were too big .
industrial designer : because they are c just generally japanese people have smaller hands so they could not get round the controller which is so if you i what you can have bigger buttons for some countries and smaller ones for others .
user interface designer : maybe to as it was indicated that risk of repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that . so , a bigger b so y you are dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you are desi dividing it according to the countries also , the market . maybe for u_s _ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in japan and all you need to have a small , .
project manager : we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , .
marketing executive : th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , .
project manager : it is gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities , .
marketing executive : i am concerned , when you read the r_s_i _ issue again , repetitive strain injury , i do not think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , that is still a question mark issue how we deal with that . , r_s_i _ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements . i am j i really ca not get my head round this one , this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it is something we should think about .
industrial designer : i was just thinking about how you could combat that without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel
marketing executive : i know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes i know .
industrial designer : and it becomes
project manager : or a speech recognition ,
industrial designer : speech recognition ,
project manager : which is extremely expensive ,
industrial designer : but
project manager : that is the only way that you avoid that issue .
marketing executive : do we have to initially , looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . do we really have to go for everyone right away ?
user interface designer : we could focus on the biggest market . if say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?
industrial designer : ge
marketing executive : and when we have been throwing up our ideas we are automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people .
project manager : we are we are talking about the type of company that we are working for as . that they want it to be fashionable , they want it to be trendy and you would not automatically assume associate that with the older generations . now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people , but i do not think we are focusing on that , we are focusing on a mid - range , business class type people .
marketing executive : i am just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the broad scale marketing stage , we want to , not waste money , not be profligate and focus on where the idea will be taken up , first it is most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .
project manager : so the remote control functions . we have got the t_v _ , we have got the video , now there is i ca not remember what it is called , the little code at the end of programme details ,
industrial designer : video plus .
project manager : yes . we could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that i always found that really easy when i discovered it , because you have got your general record anyway so if you there is a programme on you want to put record on , that is fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you are not if you are going to , you put the number in
industrial designer : just whack in the number .
project manager : and it is just a number , it is not a date , it is not a time , it is not a channel , it is not when it finishes , it is not anything like that ,
industrial designer : and you w
project manager : it is just a number .
industrial designer : and you would not need a whole host of extra buttons for that ,
project manager : no .
industrial designer : you just need one you have already got all the numbers there anyway ,
project manager : you have already got the numbers for typing in anyway .
marketing executive : i have not come across that function but it sounds wonderful .
project manager : it is after if you look in the newspaper , t_v _ guide or any t_v _ guide there is a five , six digit number afterwards
industrial designer : it is not
project manager : and that is the number you put in and it is recorded that it is going to be on tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth so you do not have to worry about dates and you do not have to worry about times , and it has been around for quite a long time .
industrial designer : it is been around for a long time it is just it is not very advertised as to how to use it and things .
project manager : no it is not but if awareness was brought to the forefront about that
marketing executive : superb .
industrial designer : though if y if you have got something like sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it will record that programme when it is on and you press it on it twice and it will record the whole series .
marketing executive : excellent ,  .
industrial designer : so that . but just to have that function would be really good .
project manager : so
marketing executive : can run this past you while it occurs to me , i do not mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that is what led us on to comparing t_v _ remote controls with their design features , chain companies like carphone warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you have got any problems with it and they will fix it , they will phone the company , you can use their telephones . is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th , which button is it i press for this ? th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?
industrial designer : but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they the companies who you deal with have actually they have got an obligation to help you out and also it is fair enough to have some help service but i am not how much the cost would be of having
project manager : the functionality of it in the sense that you are sitting there , you are pressing this button and your t_v _ is not doing it . taking your t_v _ and your control and saying look this is what i am doing , it is not working , what should i do ?
marketing executive : alright . yes if it was something as simple as you could not change the channel , but for if there were any more or are we definite it is only gonna be for t_v _ and video ,
project manager : so .
industrial designer :
marketing executive : we are not gonna put any , just a thought .
industrial designer : instru instruction books i feel c i reckon can cover that .
project manager : instruction manuals . but they are there is customer service , there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to
industrial designer : department , .
project manager : and that way there is no call out charge , there is no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , .
user interface designer : it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .
industrial designer : and they are
marketing executive : not for such simple functions
industrial designer : they should be f .
marketing executive : because we are focusing on that ,
project manager : but we should focus on making the manual as user - friendly as possible
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : simple .
project manager : because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots of pages .
marketing executive : puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes .
project manager : it does ,
industrial designer : it is the
project manager : you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about . , what other functions ? we need i am not if we need a design decision now , but we should think about c you have got the dilemma between batteries , that is what i was thinking about . mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ?
industrial designer : they are specially made for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , you could bundle a charger in with it but
project manager : they la they last quite a long time ,
industrial designer :  .
project manager : and if you had when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you are not using it or t at night , but it does not really matter it never really runs out it lasts a long time once it is charged . , something like that should reduce the size of it .
industrial designer : and if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could
project manager : it could be on that , .
industrial designer : on that as so .
user interface designer : so are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?
project manager : s yes .
industrial designer : some docking station or
project manager : rechargeable with a docking station . so the rechargeable which would be your field .
industrial designer : th that would be fine , and also that would mean they would not have to go out buying batteries all the time .
project manager : yes , which it is cheaper in the long run as . , th the shape you got trendy . i do not wanna big box with lots of things , you do not want a tiny little thing either , because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple ,
marketing executive : and we do not w so many remote controls look identical ,
project manager : they do .
marketing executive : these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . we definitely an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we do not want that .
project manager : so we have got a flip - screen .
user interface designer : what i was thinking of a design which nokia h came up with almost six or seven years back . we have a flat one it looks like a box , like a chocolate . that is very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , and you do not have to you do not bend your thumb too much , so it is like you can say a banana shape thing , curled up like a boat .
marketing executive : slightly curved , curved .
user interface designer : g so what happens is you do not have to press your thumb too down like . so it is already curled up so your thumb does not
project manager : it is moulded to your hand anyway .
user interface designer : y so we can have a s like moulded according to your the way you h hold of it is semi - circular in the bottom , something like that . i would not say exactly semi - circular but smooth .
project manager : can you look into the company logo ? , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product .
user interface designer : current .
project manager : if it was a c _ like that , you could have it in a vague c _ shape that opens up like a shell ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite into the design , while also making it quite different from anything else that is there .
user interface designer : we could look in at that but . what we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea - shells ,
marketing executive : look at the mobile .
user interface designer : logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of the model , rather than , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like .
project manager : we need to think about how it is gonna look different .
marketing executive : that is that sounds a really attractive idea ,
user interface designer : a sea shell ?
marketing executive : i have not come across anything like that before , if it and that opens out into your flip - top . then it is t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you are having to actually insert in between the two covers , that is gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that i would think . it is a really idea
user interface designer : we could look in at that .
marketing executive : and plus you can get even though we are using plastic , you can still think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a conch shell or scallop shell exterior .
project manager : or you could do different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . you could have different casings . so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and
marketing executive : less chance of it being lost too , it is not like a chocolate brown lozenge that is gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a ornament they do not not gonna lose it so much either . it is easier to bit to handle .
user interface designer : maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , that could be the most common design . but we can like think of five , six designs .
project manager : right , we have to round it up ,
marketing executive : can quickly go over the new project requirements so that i have not missed anything . so it is no teletext , it is only for t_v _ and by implication video , our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , something about videoplus .
project manager : that was in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date
marketing executive : right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the l_c_d _ , a reminder about using videoplus ? so that they have a look at the guide and or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just that was an add - on feature ?
project manager : it is kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that .
marketing executive : right , so it is doing away with the programming feature ?
project manager : it could be it c it yes , it could be adv advertisement feature , rather than design feature , drawing attention to that . and it also paid lip service in the instruction manual , it is very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful .
marketing executive : and the rechargeable batteries . was there anything else there that we in the new project requirements ?
project manager : we have got the buttons but we will work through that with the design of it , .
marketing executive : that is not at the moment a requirement , it is something we are looking at ,
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like .
project manager : and we have talked about there being an alarm , a beeping for being lost , .
user interface designer : for detection , right .
project manager : learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . but there are not gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the i the instruction manual , i if we deal with that , . and different from what is out there .
user interface designer : true .
marketing executive : what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? or shall generally look the issues involved ?
project manager : you might get guidance , but i th instruction manuals , there tends to be a demonised thing , u , they are everyone is got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them .
marketing executive : whoops , questionnaire four .
user interface designer : we should f
project manager : yes , right .
user interface designer : it is time for us to get back to
marketing executive : we are at lunchtime now .
project manager : you can email me , if there is any more questions . and i will be able to not answer them .","the industrial designer gave his presentation on the basic functions of the remote . he presented the basic components that remotes share and suggested that smaller batteries be considered in the product design . the user interface designer presented his ideas for making the remote easy-to-use; he discussed using a simple design and hiding complicated features from the main interface . the marketing expert presented the findings from a lab study on user requirements for a remote control device , and discussed users' demand for a simple interface and advanced technology . the project manager presented the new requirements that the remote not include a teletext function , that it be used only to control television , and that it include the company image in its design . the group narrowed down their target marketing group to the youth market . they discussed the functions the remote will have , including video plus capability and rechargeable batteries . a customer service plan was suggested to make the remote seem more user-friendly , but it was decided that helpful manuals were more within the budget . the group then discussed the shell-like shape of the remote and including several different casing options to buyers . the marketing expert will research consumers' opinions on instruction manuals . it was decided that the group will produce one product design instead of creating alternate designs in an attempt to accomodate different users' preferences . the marketing will be focused towards a young , business-class buyer . the remote will feature video plus capabilities and a seashell-like shape to accomodate the lcd display and the flip screen . the remote will be bundled with a docking station to recharge the remote's batteries and a user-friendly instruction manual , and multiple casings will be made available . the limitations of the budget will restrict the development of some features; several of the features that the group wanted to include may have to be made simpler to decrease cost .
","the project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and briefed the team on some new requirements to abide by in designing the remote . the user interface designer presented two existing remote controls on the market and discussed what features the team should integrate into the design of the remote . the marketing expert discussed the results of trend watching reports which indicated a need for products which have a fruit and vegetable theme , are easy to use , are technologically innovative , are not flashy , have a fruit and vegetable theme , and are not targeted towards the elderly . the industrial designer presented options for batteries which would keep the remote powered all the time . the team then discussed how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the design of the remote . the industrial designer will work on the look and feel of the design . the user interface designer will work on the user interface design . the marketing expert will work on the product evaluation the remote will not contain a talk-back function . the remote will have an lcd screen . the remote will have a jog dial . the remote will have a power button . whether to include a talk-back function in the design of the remote . how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the design of the remote . whether to include a jog dial in the design of the remote .",,,,X,,,,,8.0,Pegasus-Baseline
10,"project manager : help . it is up there ? that screen is black . , that is fine .
marketing executive : god .
project manager : are we done ? right , this is our second meeting and i might be a bit all over the place . , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ?
marketing executive : no that is ,
project manager : i will go over what we decided last meeting ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , t_v _ , video equipment . , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . we decided it was important to reflect the company is image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , that s thing . , our budget would have to affect try not to reflect our budget , that we might have a bit of you can see it , . dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . we discussed a flip - open design , reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming , things like that . , three presentations , i have got written here so shall we hear from marketing first ?
marketing executive : is it if i postpone that til later , want to get access to a little bit more information ,
project manager : no that is fine , that is fine .
marketing executive : is that ?
industrial designer : i will go first . can i grab the
project manager : unplug me .
industrial designer : what do i have to press ?
project manager : f_n _ function f _ eight .
industrial designer : right , . maybe there we go . this is the working design , presented by me , the industrial designer extraordinaire . , this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so . what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design ? , a device which just sends the signal to the t_v _ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel or the volume , everything is just some signal to change the state of the t_v _ or other appliance that it is sending the signal to . , so i decided i would have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . but although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make that our design stands out and that was something that it was not really my area because i am dealing with the inside really . so , i ran out of time so i could not do this one as fun as the last one . and i found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t_v _ presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you do not need to send very much information . , most of them are powered by some form of battery . now our one , i am not whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a _ batteries but those can be quite bulky so i d i did not know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control .
marketing executive :  . could i interject to ask a question there ,
project manager :  .
marketing executive : is that appropriate ? you are saying the triple a _ batteries are small or the surrounding it ?
industrial designer : no , if you look at most remote controls they are quite chunky and that is because of the size of the batteries , they have to be this certain size to fit those batteries in .
marketing executive : right , the triple a_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?
industrial designer : the
project manager : they are .
industrial designer : you can get the circular round ones but i am just wondering about power consumption
marketing executive : i see .
industrial designer : and how much you need to send the data across . , and d which leads onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . , now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . now the main components i came up with were the power source for the batteries otherwise it is not gonna work , as i said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can discuss that later and then you need something to decode the information that you are putting in from the controller now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is suitable for anyone who is watching the t_v _ unless they are in a cinema , which not most people do so as we are applying to the most audience that should be fine . and then i was just had a quick look at the external design but i d i left that mostly to the interface designer . and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wanna do . it is not a proper circuit , i am not if it would work or not , i am not even confident that those are the real way you would wire it up but anyway , we have just got the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the u_i _ interface which would , when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i_r _ data which could be decoded by the t_v _ receiver , which means that we are gonna have to conform to whatever form of communication that the t_v_s are already using and since that is another use and reason to use that infrared because that is what all t_v_s use at the moment . and then finally , we want the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that i have put forward are low in cost so that should be good . it should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about , because they are small they are also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti - going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , i th that was just a general point there .
marketing executive : that is a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so refer to that , whenever you like me to present .
industrial designer : alright , and , that is what i came up with there ,
project manager : very much .
industrial designer : so if you wanna
project manager : would you like to continue on from that ?
user interface designer : it can be
project manager : or , maybe move the laptop over .
user interface designer : that is with me . why is it not working ? f _ eight , right ?
project manager : f _ function .
industrial designer : function f _ eight .
user interface designer : why is it in the right ?
marketing executive : no . the plug has not come out at the bottom , has it ?
user interface designer : it is connecting .
industrial designer : no , no it is just .
marketing executive : meter adjusting .
project manager : there .
user interface designer : . actually some of my points might overlap with what william is just mention , but my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which we will take a feedback from the marketing because , i have not had some marketing data and every product is marketable . so purpose , as william already said , i would put it to simplify the interaction with t_v _ to make it as simple as possible . and to summarise i would say it is it should be user - friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . but we are to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together . so what the concept is to have a flip - top model . the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip - top . so it is like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of audience and we can punch in new f features such as added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . findings most people prefer us user - friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year and they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it is not of no use of punching in the trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . as we saw we have to make a profit also so we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production by fifty million we said ? , with that we will be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . , that is so this is if you ask me personally , i would make flip - top with a trendy design and s maybe we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use usage and all that . so in overall a simple and user - friendly design . any comments like , if you want ?
project manager : we will chat about it at the end , so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , it is vibrating , that is strange .
user interface designer : you will have to
marketing executive : have i got to keep this here ?
user interface designer : you ca not
marketing executive : does it matter ?
user interface designer : it will have to this ca not be pulled .
marketing executive : i will have t i will have to move it wo not i ?
project manager : we just do the best we can .
marketing executive : whoops .
user interface designer : you will have to push it a bit more .
marketing executive : will it manage ? bit more , dear .
user interface designer : this is more than enough .
industrial designer : there we go , i have got a bit more of the cable .
marketing executive : is that ?
user interface designer : you can pull it out now .
marketing executive : just pull it closer a little bit .
industrial designer : you should be able to and
project manager : you might .
industrial designer : there you go .
marketing executive : get it right over , .
project manager : look at that .
marketing executive : i am going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and our starting point with marketing is always market research . , so that is where we started , we used our usability lab , the company is usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross - section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . our findings , lots of findings , i have just summarised some of them here . the overall thing which i have got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but that is quite a high proportion of our , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that is a bit nicer looking . , current remote controls do not match with the operating behaviour of the user overall . , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , so you have got your person sunk back in the sofa channel - hopping . so again there is power implications there . , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we do not have so many functions actually on the remote control . the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier , remote controls are often lost in the room , it is a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , fifty percent were particularly frustrated by that . thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and that ties in with the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just ca not be bothered to learn about the other functions . , slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury . those small movements of the remote control can lead to shoulder and elbow problems . the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid in when they have lost the actual remote control , some speech recognition . something we did not put to them , but which i am thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . , that trend reverses in the older age groups . so thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it reverses , they are not so bothered with this . i had marvellous tables and things that i could show you , but i will just keep it simple , if there is any more information email you extra details ,
user interface designer : that is fine .
project manager : . right , we have new project requirements , we are not going to be using teletext , the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . our control is only going to be for t_v _ , it is not going to be a combined control , which limits all of the different things that it limits the cost for us , but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .
marketing executive :  , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?
project manager : it says for t_v _ only , so looks like it is just
marketing executive : just channel - hopping .
project manager : maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but i , what do you think ? it just said , for t_v _ only . but , general t_v _ controls do video as .
marketing executive : would that imply video use ?
industrial designer : t . i d the w if you have g
project manager : you bu som you get com you get combined t_v _ and videos do not you ?
industrial designer : . if
marketing executive :  , yes .
industrial designer : and if you got a sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the t_v _ anyway so on to like the t_v _ hard drive or so .
project manager : we assume that it is still got play and stop functions and programming .
user interface designer : anything about that on the market research like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?
marketing executive : yes . we did not really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about ten percent of the buttons ,
user interface designer : ten perc
marketing executive : th those do tend to be the basic channel - hopping things and on and off for the video , fast - forwarding , so on and it is general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare
industrial designer : ju just as an idea on the speech recognition thing that pr it would probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing
user interface designer : pens
industrial designer : and they are not that great anyway .
marketing executive : i have just called up that table there ,
industrial designer : alright , .
marketing executive : we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we did not differentiate . would you prefer an l_c_d _ screen , that is multi - function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? so you can see how the yes no varies across the age group there , and a substantial number of do not knows in the older age group , that is just general fear of new technology .
industrial designer : but on that again thought you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it will let off a loud noise to let where it is
project manager : bu
industrial designer : so that could be quite a
marketing executive : right .
project manager : we do have a budget limitation that we ca not control ourselves , so when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing because it is something i it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you do not lose , you were saying whistling ,
industrial designer : .
project manager : maybe on the t_v _ you could put like a pack on the t_v _ so you ca not see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the t_v _ and it beeps and you are like it is over there , something like that ,
marketing executive : that is a super idea .
project manager : but that is that sounds a lot cheaper to me . the third thing was that we have to make the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . so we want logo , we want fashionable , trendy , what you were talking about with the marketing . , people paying more for it to look good . , we need to focus on that as .
marketing executive : yes , further market research will be needed to focus on what that is , it is gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who is sixty and also across the world if we are aiming at the international market . what is attractive to a trendy new yorker and what is attractive to a retired south african , you get the idea . it is it is gonna vary around the world . at the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it is the user interface design that may and th the fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .
user interface designer : so are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ?
industrial designer : y you could have a number of different designs
user interface designer : alright .
industrial designer : inside they would be essentially exactly the same .
user interface designer : right . the features could be same and the body could look slightly different .
industrial designer : just , .
user interface designer : so
project manager : what about you were talking about the buttons , the controls that are coming out now have big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , we got to make it original , what about with the touch screen computers
industrial designer : that is what i was just .
project manager : ? so you it is like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which should not wear out as much either , not about the
industrial designer : you would not have to you do not actually have to press them you just
project manager : you do not have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it . , think that might appeal i am thinking japan , i am thinking young , office people ,
marketing executive : .
project manager : trendy a thing .
marketing executive : yes it will appeal to sections of the market def
project manager : but quite , easily labelled so that anyone can that is obvious what that is for and it is not daunting to maybe the older generations ,
marketing executive :  , .
industrial designer : but also er ergonomics as we are saying with the different designs , ergonomics there is physically different things if you have ever seen the x _ box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan would not buy it because the controller was physically to big
project manager : were too big .
industrial designer : because they are c just generally japanese people have smaller hands so they could not get round the controller which is so if you i what you can have bigger buttons for some countries and smaller ones for others .
user interface designer : maybe to as it was indicated that risk of repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that . so , a bigger b so y you are dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you are desi dividing it according to the countries also , the market . maybe for u_s _ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in japan and all you need to have a small , .
project manager : we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , .
marketing executive : th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , .
project manager : it is gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities , .
marketing executive : i am concerned , when you read the r_s_i _ issue again , repetitive strain injury , i do not think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , that is still a question mark issue how we deal with that . , r_s_i _ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements . i am j i really ca not get my head round this one , this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it is something we should think about .
industrial designer : i was just thinking about how you could combat that without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel
marketing executive : i know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes i know .
industrial designer : and it becomes
project manager : or a speech recognition ,
industrial designer : speech recognition ,
project manager : which is extremely expensive ,
industrial designer : but
project manager : that is the only way that you avoid that issue .
marketing executive : do we have to initially , looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . do we really have to go for everyone right away ?
user interface designer : we could focus on the biggest market . if say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?
industrial designer : ge
marketing executive : and when we have been throwing up our ideas we are automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people .
project manager : we are we are talking about the type of company that we are working for as . that they want it to be fashionable , they want it to be trendy and you would not automatically assume associate that with the older generations . now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people , but i do not think we are focusing on that , we are focusing on a mid - range , business class type people .
marketing executive : i am just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the broad scale marketing stage , we want to , not waste money , not be profligate and focus on where the idea will be taken up , first it is most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .
project manager : so the remote control functions . we have got the t_v _ , we have got the video , now there is i ca not remember what it is called , the little code at the end of programme details ,
industrial designer : video plus .
project manager : yes . we could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that i always found that really easy when i discovered it , because you have got your general record anyway so if you there is a programme on you want to put record on , that is fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you are not if you are going to , you put the number in
industrial designer : just whack in the number .
project manager : and it is just a number , it is not a date , it is not a time , it is not a channel , it is not when it finishes , it is not anything like that ,
industrial designer : and you w
project manager : it is just a number .
industrial designer : and you would not need a whole host of extra buttons for that ,
project manager : no .
industrial designer : you just need one you have already got all the numbers there anyway ,
project manager : you have already got the numbers for typing in anyway .
marketing executive : i have not come across that function but it sounds wonderful .
project manager : it is after if you look in the newspaper , t_v _ guide or any t_v _ guide there is a five , six digit number afterwards
industrial designer : it is not
project manager : and that is the number you put in and it is recorded that it is going to be on tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth so you do not have to worry about dates and you do not have to worry about times , and it has been around for quite a long time .
industrial designer : it is been around for a long time it is just it is not very advertised as to how to use it and things .
project manager : no it is not but if awareness was brought to the forefront about that
marketing executive : superb .
industrial designer : though if y if you have got something like sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it will record that programme when it is on and you press it on it twice and it will record the whole series .
marketing executive : excellent ,  .
industrial designer : so that . but just to have that function would be really good .
project manager : so
marketing executive : can run this past you while it occurs to me , i do not mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that is what led us on to comparing t_v _ remote controls with their design features , chain companies like carphone warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you have got any problems with it and they will fix it , they will phone the company , you can use their telephones . is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th , which button is it i press for this ? th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?
industrial designer : but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they the companies who you deal with have actually they have got an obligation to help you out and also it is fair enough to have some help service but i am not how much the cost would be of having
project manager : the functionality of it in the sense that you are sitting there , you are pressing this button and your t_v _ is not doing it . taking your t_v _ and your control and saying look this is what i am doing , it is not working , what should i do ?
marketing executive : alright . yes if it was something as simple as you could not change the channel , but for if there were any more or are we definite it is only gonna be for t_v _ and video ,
project manager : so .
industrial designer :
marketing executive : we are not gonna put any , just a thought .
industrial designer : instru instruction books i feel c i reckon can cover that .
project manager : instruction manuals . but they are there is customer service , there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to
industrial designer : department , .
project manager : and that way there is no call out charge , there is no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , .
user interface designer : it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .
industrial designer : and they are
marketing executive : not for such simple functions
industrial designer : they should be f .
marketing executive : because we are focusing on that ,
project manager : but we should focus on making the manual as user - friendly as possible
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : simple .
project manager : because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots of pages .
marketing executive : puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes .
project manager : it does ,
industrial designer : it is the
project manager : you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about . , what other functions ? we need i am not if we need a design decision now , but we should think about c you have got the dilemma between batteries , that is what i was thinking about . mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ?
industrial designer : they are specially made for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , you could bundle a charger in with it but
project manager : they la they last quite a long time ,
industrial designer :  .
project manager : and if you had when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you are not using it or t at night , but it does not really matter it never really runs out it lasts a long time once it is charged . , something like that should reduce the size of it .
industrial designer : and if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could
project manager : it could be on that , .
industrial designer : on that as so .
user interface designer : so are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?
project manager : s yes .
industrial designer : some docking station or
project manager : rechargeable with a docking station . so the rechargeable which would be your field .
industrial designer : th that would be fine , and also that would mean they would not have to go out buying batteries all the time .
project manager : yes , which it is cheaper in the long run as . , th the shape you got trendy . i do not wanna big box with lots of things , you do not want a tiny little thing either , because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple ,
marketing executive : and we do not w so many remote controls look identical ,
project manager : they do .
marketing executive : these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . we definitely an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we do not want that .
project manager : so we have got a flip - screen .
user interface designer : what i was thinking of a design which nokia h came up with almost six or seven years back . we have a flat one it looks like a box , like a chocolate . that is very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , and you do not have to you do not bend your thumb too much , so it is like you can say a banana shape thing , curled up like a boat .
marketing executive : slightly curved , curved .
user interface designer : g so what happens is you do not have to press your thumb too down like . so it is already curled up so your thumb does not
project manager : it is moulded to your hand anyway .
user interface designer : y so we can have a s like moulded according to your the way you h hold of it is semi - circular in the bottom , something like that . i would not say exactly semi - circular but smooth .
project manager : can you look into the company logo ? , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product .
user interface designer : current .
project manager : if it was a c _ like that , you could have it in a vague c _ shape that opens up like a shell ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite into the design , while also making it quite different from anything else that is there .
user interface designer : we could look in at that but . what we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea - shells ,
marketing executive : look at the mobile .
user interface designer : logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of the model , rather than , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like .
project manager : we need to think about how it is gonna look different .
marketing executive : that is that sounds a really attractive idea ,
user interface designer : a sea shell ?
marketing executive : i have not come across anything like that before , if it and that opens out into your flip - top . then it is t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you are having to actually insert in between the two covers , that is gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that i would think . it is a really idea
user interface designer : we could look in at that .
marketing executive : and plus you can get even though we are using plastic , you can still think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a conch shell or scallop shell exterior .
project manager : or you could do different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . you could have different casings . so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and
marketing executive : less chance of it being lost too , it is not like a chocolate brown lozenge that is gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a ornament they do not not gonna lose it so much either . it is easier to bit to handle .
user interface designer : maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , that could be the most common design . but we can like think of five , six designs .
project manager : right , we have to round it up ,
marketing executive : can quickly go over the new project requirements so that i have not missed anything . so it is no teletext , it is only for t_v _ and by implication video , our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , something about videoplus .
project manager : that was in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date
marketing executive : right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the l_c_d _ , a reminder about using videoplus ? so that they have a look at the guide and or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just that was an add - on feature ?
project manager : it is kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that .
marketing executive : right , so it is doing away with the programming feature ?
project manager : it could be it c it yes , it could be adv advertisement feature , rather than design feature , drawing attention to that . and it also paid lip service in the instruction manual , it is very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful .
marketing executive : and the rechargeable batteries . was there anything else there that we in the new project requirements ?
project manager : we have got the buttons but we will work through that with the design of it , .
marketing executive : that is not at the moment a requirement , it is something we are looking at ,
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like .
project manager : and we have talked about there being an alarm , a beeping for being lost , .
user interface designer : for detection , right .
project manager : learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . but there are not gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the i the instruction manual , i if we deal with that , . and different from what is out there .
user interface designer : true .
marketing executive : what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? or shall generally look the issues involved ?
project manager : you might get guidance , but i th instruction manuals , there tends to be a demonised thing , u , they are everyone is got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them .
marketing executive : whoops , questionnaire four .
user interface designer : we should f
project manager : yes , right .
user interface designer : it is time for us to get back to
marketing executive : we are at lunchtime now .
project manager : you can email me , if there is any more questions . and i will be able to not answer them .","the industrial designer gave his presentation on the basic functions of the remote . he presented the basic components that remotes share and suggested that smaller batteries be considered in the product design . the user interface designer presented his ideas for making the remote easy-to-use; he discussed using a simple design and hiding complicated features from the main interface . the marketing expert presented the findings from a lab study on user requirements for a remote control device , and discussed users' demand for a simple interface and advanced technology . the project manager presented the new requirements that the remote not include a teletext function , that it be used only to control television , and that it include the company image in its design . the group narrowed down their target marketing group to the youth market . they discussed the functions the remote will have , including video plus capability and rechargeable batteries . a customer service plan was suggested to make the remote seem more user-friendly , but it was decided that helpful manuals were more within the budget . the group then discussed the shell-like shape of the remote and including several different casing options to buyers . the marketing expert will research consumers' opinions on instruction manuals . it was decided that the group will produce one product design instead of creating alternate designs in an attempt to accomodate different users' preferences . the marketing will be focused towards a young , business-class buyer . the remote will feature video plus capabilities and a seashell-like shape to accomodate the lcd display and the flip screen . the remote will be bundled with a docking station to recharge the remote's batteries and a user-friendly instruction manual , and multiple casings will be made available . the limitations of the budget will restrict the development of some features; several of the features that the group wanted to include may have to be made simpler to decrease cost .
","the project manager reviewed the decisions made in the previous meeting . the industrial designer presented the working design of the remote and discussed various options for batteries . he discussed using infrared , flip-open design , and adding an electronic panel for further features . she also discussed using a circular battery to reduce the size of the control , as well as reducing the power consumption of the device . they discussed including an lcd screen for easier reading of the menus on the remote , a programmable remote and incorporating a screen for programming options . there was a discussion of the project budget , the marketing expert discussed trends in the industry , trend watching the company image in the product , fashion in the company logo , accessibility , age range , reflecting the company's image , aesthetic appeal to young and to older consumers .",,,,X,,,,,8.0,T5-Baseline
11,"project manager : help . it is up there ? that screen is black . , that is fine .
marketing executive : god .
project manager : are we done ? right , this is our second meeting and i might be a bit all over the place . , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ?
marketing executive : no that is ,
project manager : i will go over what we decided last meeting ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , t_v _ , video equipment . , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . we decided it was important to reflect the company is image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , that s thing . , our budget would have to affect try not to reflect our budget , that we might have a bit of you can see it , . dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . we discussed a flip - open design , reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming , things like that . , three presentations , i have got written here so shall we hear from marketing first ?
marketing executive : is it if i postpone that til later , want to get access to a little bit more information ,
project manager : no that is fine , that is fine .
marketing executive : is that ?
industrial designer : i will go first . can i grab the
project manager : unplug me .
industrial designer : what do i have to press ?
project manager : f_n _ function f _ eight .
industrial designer : right , . maybe there we go . this is the working design , presented by me , the industrial designer extraordinaire . , this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so . what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design ? , a device which just sends the signal to the t_v _ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel or the volume , everything is just some signal to change the state of the t_v _ or other appliance that it is sending the signal to . , so i decided i would have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . but although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make that our design stands out and that was something that it was not really my area because i am dealing with the inside really . so , i ran out of time so i could not do this one as fun as the last one . and i found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t_v _ presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you do not need to send very much information . , most of them are powered by some form of battery . now our one , i am not whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a _ batteries but those can be quite bulky so i d i did not know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control .
marketing executive :  . could i interject to ask a question there ,
project manager :  .
marketing executive : is that appropriate ? you are saying the triple a _ batteries are small or the surrounding it ?
industrial designer : no , if you look at most remote controls they are quite chunky and that is because of the size of the batteries , they have to be this certain size to fit those batteries in .
marketing executive : right , the triple a_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?
industrial designer : the
project manager : they are .
industrial designer : you can get the circular round ones but i am just wondering about power consumption
marketing executive : i see .
industrial designer : and how much you need to send the data across . , and d which leads onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . , now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . now the main components i came up with were the power source for the batteries otherwise it is not gonna work , as i said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can discuss that later and then you need something to decode the information that you are putting in from the controller now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is suitable for anyone who is watching the t_v _ unless they are in a cinema , which not most people do so as we are applying to the most audience that should be fine . and then i was just had a quick look at the external design but i d i left that mostly to the interface designer . and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wanna do . it is not a proper circuit , i am not if it would work or not , i am not even confident that those are the real way you would wire it up but anyway , we have just got the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the u_i _ interface which would , when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i_r _ data which could be decoded by the t_v _ receiver , which means that we are gonna have to conform to whatever form of communication that the t_v_s are already using and since that is another use and reason to use that infrared because that is what all t_v_s use at the moment . and then finally , we want the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that i have put forward are low in cost so that should be good . it should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about , because they are small they are also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti - going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , i th that was just a general point there .
marketing executive : that is a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so refer to that , whenever you like me to present .
industrial designer : alright , and , that is what i came up with there ,
project manager : very much .
industrial designer : so if you wanna
project manager : would you like to continue on from that ?
user interface designer : it can be
project manager : or , maybe move the laptop over .
user interface designer : that is with me . why is it not working ? f _ eight , right ?
project manager : f _ function .
industrial designer : function f _ eight .
user interface designer : why is it in the right ?
marketing executive : no . the plug has not come out at the bottom , has it ?
user interface designer : it is connecting .
industrial designer : no , no it is just .
marketing executive : meter adjusting .
project manager : there .
user interface designer : . actually some of my points might overlap with what william is just mention , but my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which we will take a feedback from the marketing because , i have not had some marketing data and every product is marketable . so purpose , as william already said , i would put it to simplify the interaction with t_v _ to make it as simple as possible . and to summarise i would say it is it should be user - friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . but we are to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together . so what the concept is to have a flip - top model . the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip - top . so it is like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of audience and we can punch in new f features such as added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . findings most people prefer us user - friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year and they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it is not of no use of punching in the trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . as we saw we have to make a profit also so we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production by fifty million we said ? , with that we will be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . , that is so this is if you ask me personally , i would make flip - top with a trendy design and s maybe we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use usage and all that . so in overall a simple and user - friendly design . any comments like , if you want ?
project manager : we will chat about it at the end , so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , it is vibrating , that is strange .
user interface designer : you will have to
marketing executive : have i got to keep this here ?
user interface designer : you ca not
marketing executive : does it matter ?
user interface designer : it will have to this ca not be pulled .
marketing executive : i will have t i will have to move it wo not i ?
project manager : we just do the best we can .
marketing executive : whoops .
user interface designer : you will have to push it a bit more .
marketing executive : will it manage ? bit more , dear .
user interface designer : this is more than enough .
industrial designer : there we go , i have got a bit more of the cable .
marketing executive : is that ?
user interface designer : you can pull it out now .
marketing executive : just pull it closer a little bit .
industrial designer : you should be able to and
project manager : you might .
industrial designer : there you go .
marketing executive : get it right over , .
project manager : look at that .
marketing executive : i am going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and our starting point with marketing is always market research . , so that is where we started , we used our usability lab , the company is usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross - section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . our findings , lots of findings , i have just summarised some of them here . the overall thing which i have got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but that is quite a high proportion of our , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that is a bit nicer looking . , current remote controls do not match with the operating behaviour of the user overall . , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , so you have got your person sunk back in the sofa channel - hopping . so again there is power implications there . , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we do not have so many functions actually on the remote control . the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier , remote controls are often lost in the room , it is a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , fifty percent were particularly frustrated by that . thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and that ties in with the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just ca not be bothered to learn about the other functions . , slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury . those small movements of the remote control can lead to shoulder and elbow problems . the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid in when they have lost the actual remote control , some speech recognition . something we did not put to them , but which i am thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . , that trend reverses in the older age groups . so thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it reverses , they are not so bothered with this . i had marvellous tables and things that i could show you , but i will just keep it simple , if there is any more information email you extra details ,
user interface designer : that is fine .
project manager : . right , we have new project requirements , we are not going to be using teletext , the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . our control is only going to be for t_v _ , it is not going to be a combined control , which limits all of the different things that it limits the cost for us , but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .
marketing executive :  , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?
project manager : it says for t_v _ only , so looks like it is just
marketing executive : just channel - hopping .
project manager : maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but i , what do you think ? it just said , for t_v _ only . but , general t_v _ controls do video as .
marketing executive : would that imply video use ?
industrial designer : t . i d the w if you have g
project manager : you bu som you get com you get combined t_v _ and videos do not you ?
industrial designer : . if
marketing executive :  , yes .
industrial designer : and if you got a sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the t_v _ anyway so on to like the t_v _ hard drive or so .
project manager : we assume that it is still got play and stop functions and programming .
user interface designer : anything about that on the market research like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?
marketing executive : yes . we did not really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about ten percent of the buttons ,
user interface designer : ten perc
marketing executive : th those do tend to be the basic channel - hopping things and on and off for the video , fast - forwarding , so on and it is general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare
industrial designer : ju just as an idea on the speech recognition thing that pr it would probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing
user interface designer : pens
industrial designer : and they are not that great anyway .
marketing executive : i have just called up that table there ,
industrial designer : alright , .
marketing executive : we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we did not differentiate . would you prefer an l_c_d _ screen , that is multi - function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? so you can see how the yes no varies across the age group there , and a substantial number of do not knows in the older age group , that is just general fear of new technology .
industrial designer : but on that again thought you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it will let off a loud noise to let where it is
project manager : bu
industrial designer : so that could be quite a
marketing executive : right .
project manager : we do have a budget limitation that we ca not control ourselves , so when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing because it is something i it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you do not lose , you were saying whistling ,
industrial designer : .
project manager : maybe on the t_v _ you could put like a pack on the t_v _ so you ca not see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the t_v _ and it beeps and you are like it is over there , something like that ,
marketing executive : that is a super idea .
project manager : but that is that sounds a lot cheaper to me . the third thing was that we have to make the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . so we want logo , we want fashionable , trendy , what you were talking about with the marketing . , people paying more for it to look good . , we need to focus on that as .
marketing executive : yes , further market research will be needed to focus on what that is , it is gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who is sixty and also across the world if we are aiming at the international market . what is attractive to a trendy new yorker and what is attractive to a retired south african , you get the idea . it is it is gonna vary around the world . at the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it is the user interface design that may and th the fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .
user interface designer : so are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ?
industrial designer : y you could have a number of different designs
user interface designer : alright .
industrial designer : inside they would be essentially exactly the same .
user interface designer : right . the features could be same and the body could look slightly different .
industrial designer : just , .
user interface designer : so
project manager : what about you were talking about the buttons , the controls that are coming out now have big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , we got to make it original , what about with the touch screen computers
industrial designer : that is what i was just .
project manager : ? so you it is like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which should not wear out as much either , not about the
industrial designer : you would not have to you do not actually have to press them you just
project manager : you do not have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it . , think that might appeal i am thinking japan , i am thinking young , office people ,
marketing executive : .
project manager : trendy a thing .
marketing executive : yes it will appeal to sections of the market def
project manager : but quite , easily labelled so that anyone can that is obvious what that is for and it is not daunting to maybe the older generations ,
marketing executive :  , .
industrial designer : but also er ergonomics as we are saying with the different designs , ergonomics there is physically different things if you have ever seen the x _ box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan would not buy it because the controller was physically to big
project manager : were too big .
industrial designer : because they are c just generally japanese people have smaller hands so they could not get round the controller which is so if you i what you can have bigger buttons for some countries and smaller ones for others .
user interface designer : maybe to as it was indicated that risk of repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that . so , a bigger b so y you are dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you are desi dividing it according to the countries also , the market . maybe for u_s _ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in japan and all you need to have a small , .
project manager : we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , .
marketing executive : th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , .
project manager : it is gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities , .
marketing executive : i am concerned , when you read the r_s_i _ issue again , repetitive strain injury , i do not think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , that is still a question mark issue how we deal with that . , r_s_i _ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements . i am j i really ca not get my head round this one , this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it is something we should think about .
industrial designer : i was just thinking about how you could combat that without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel
marketing executive : i know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes i know .
industrial designer : and it becomes
project manager : or a speech recognition ,
industrial designer : speech recognition ,
project manager : which is extremely expensive ,
industrial designer : but
project manager : that is the only way that you avoid that issue .
marketing executive : do we have to initially , looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . do we really have to go for everyone right away ?
user interface designer : we could focus on the biggest market . if say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?
industrial designer : ge
marketing executive : and when we have been throwing up our ideas we are automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people .
project manager : we are we are talking about the type of company that we are working for as . that they want it to be fashionable , they want it to be trendy and you would not automatically assume associate that with the older generations . now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people , but i do not think we are focusing on that , we are focusing on a mid - range , business class type people .
marketing executive : i am just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the broad scale marketing stage , we want to , not waste money , not be profligate and focus on where the idea will be taken up , first it is most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .
project manager : so the remote control functions . we have got the t_v _ , we have got the video , now there is i ca not remember what it is called , the little code at the end of programme details ,
industrial designer : video plus .
project manager : yes . we could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that i always found that really easy when i discovered it , because you have got your general record anyway so if you there is a programme on you want to put record on , that is fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you are not if you are going to , you put the number in
industrial designer : just whack in the number .
project manager : and it is just a number , it is not a date , it is not a time , it is not a channel , it is not when it finishes , it is not anything like that ,
industrial designer : and you w
project manager : it is just a number .
industrial designer : and you would not need a whole host of extra buttons for that ,
project manager : no .
industrial designer : you just need one you have already got all the numbers there anyway ,
project manager : you have already got the numbers for typing in anyway .
marketing executive : i have not come across that function but it sounds wonderful .
project manager : it is after if you look in the newspaper , t_v _ guide or any t_v _ guide there is a five , six digit number afterwards
industrial designer : it is not
project manager : and that is the number you put in and it is recorded that it is going to be on tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth so you do not have to worry about dates and you do not have to worry about times , and it has been around for quite a long time .
industrial designer : it is been around for a long time it is just it is not very advertised as to how to use it and things .
project manager : no it is not but if awareness was brought to the forefront about that
marketing executive : superb .
industrial designer : though if y if you have got something like sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it will record that programme when it is on and you press it on it twice and it will record the whole series .
marketing executive : excellent ,  .
industrial designer : so that . but just to have that function would be really good .
project manager : so
marketing executive : can run this past you while it occurs to me , i do not mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that is what led us on to comparing t_v _ remote controls with their design features , chain companies like carphone warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you have got any problems with it and they will fix it , they will phone the company , you can use their telephones . is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th , which button is it i press for this ? th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?
industrial designer : but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they the companies who you deal with have actually they have got an obligation to help you out and also it is fair enough to have some help service but i am not how much the cost would be of having
project manager : the functionality of it in the sense that you are sitting there , you are pressing this button and your t_v _ is not doing it . taking your t_v _ and your control and saying look this is what i am doing , it is not working , what should i do ?
marketing executive : alright . yes if it was something as simple as you could not change the channel , but for if there were any more or are we definite it is only gonna be for t_v _ and video ,
project manager : so .
industrial designer :
marketing executive : we are not gonna put any , just a thought .
industrial designer : instru instruction books i feel c i reckon can cover that .
project manager : instruction manuals . but they are there is customer service , there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to
industrial designer : department , .
project manager : and that way there is no call out charge , there is no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , .
user interface designer : it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .
industrial designer : and they are
marketing executive : not for such simple functions
industrial designer : they should be f .
marketing executive : because we are focusing on that ,
project manager : but we should focus on making the manual as user - friendly as possible
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : simple .
project manager : because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots of pages .
marketing executive : puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes .
project manager : it does ,
industrial designer : it is the
project manager : you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about . , what other functions ? we need i am not if we need a design decision now , but we should think about c you have got the dilemma between batteries , that is what i was thinking about . mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ?
industrial designer : they are specially made for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , you could bundle a charger in with it but
project manager : they la they last quite a long time ,
industrial designer :  .
project manager : and if you had when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you are not using it or t at night , but it does not really matter it never really runs out it lasts a long time once it is charged . , something like that should reduce the size of it .
industrial designer : and if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could
project manager : it could be on that , .
industrial designer : on that as so .
user interface designer : so are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?
project manager : s yes .
industrial designer : some docking station or
project manager : rechargeable with a docking station . so the rechargeable which would be your field .
industrial designer : th that would be fine , and also that would mean they would not have to go out buying batteries all the time .
project manager : yes , which it is cheaper in the long run as . , th the shape you got trendy . i do not wanna big box with lots of things , you do not want a tiny little thing either , because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple ,
marketing executive : and we do not w so many remote controls look identical ,
project manager : they do .
marketing executive : these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . we definitely an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we do not want that .
project manager : so we have got a flip - screen .
user interface designer : what i was thinking of a design which nokia h came up with almost six or seven years back . we have a flat one it looks like a box , like a chocolate . that is very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , and you do not have to you do not bend your thumb too much , so it is like you can say a banana shape thing , curled up like a boat .
marketing executive : slightly curved , curved .
user interface designer : g so what happens is you do not have to press your thumb too down like . so it is already curled up so your thumb does not
project manager : it is moulded to your hand anyway .
user interface designer : y so we can have a s like moulded according to your the way you h hold of it is semi - circular in the bottom , something like that . i would not say exactly semi - circular but smooth .
project manager : can you look into the company logo ? , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product .
user interface designer : current .
project manager : if it was a c _ like that , you could have it in a vague c _ shape that opens up like a shell ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite into the design , while also making it quite different from anything else that is there .
user interface designer : we could look in at that but . what we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea - shells ,
marketing executive : look at the mobile .
user interface designer : logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of the model , rather than , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like .
project manager : we need to think about how it is gonna look different .
marketing executive : that is that sounds a really attractive idea ,
user interface designer : a sea shell ?
marketing executive : i have not come across anything like that before , if it and that opens out into your flip - top . then it is t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you are having to actually insert in between the two covers , that is gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that i would think . it is a really idea
user interface designer : we could look in at that .
marketing executive : and plus you can get even though we are using plastic , you can still think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a conch shell or scallop shell exterior .
project manager : or you could do different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . you could have different casings . so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and
marketing executive : less chance of it being lost too , it is not like a chocolate brown lozenge that is gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a ornament they do not not gonna lose it so much either . it is easier to bit to handle .
user interface designer : maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , that could be the most common design . but we can like think of five , six designs .
project manager : right , we have to round it up ,
marketing executive : can quickly go over the new project requirements so that i have not missed anything . so it is no teletext , it is only for t_v _ and by implication video , our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , something about videoplus .
project manager : that was in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date
marketing executive : right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the l_c_d _ , a reminder about using videoplus ? so that they have a look at the guide and or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just that was an add - on feature ?
project manager : it is kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that .
marketing executive : right , so it is doing away with the programming feature ?
project manager : it could be it c it yes , it could be adv advertisement feature , rather than design feature , drawing attention to that . and it also paid lip service in the instruction manual , it is very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful .
marketing executive : and the rechargeable batteries . was there anything else there that we in the new project requirements ?
project manager : we have got the buttons but we will work through that with the design of it , .
marketing executive : that is not at the moment a requirement , it is something we are looking at ,
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like .
project manager : and we have talked about there being an alarm , a beeping for being lost , .
user interface designer : for detection , right .
project manager : learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . but there are not gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the i the instruction manual , i if we deal with that , . and different from what is out there .
user interface designer : true .
marketing executive : what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? or shall generally look the issues involved ?
project manager : you might get guidance , but i th instruction manuals , there tends to be a demonised thing , u , they are everyone is got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them .
marketing executive : whoops , questionnaire four .
user interface designer : we should f
project manager : yes , right .
user interface designer : it is time for us to get back to
marketing executive : we are at lunchtime now .
project manager : you can email me , if there is any more questions . and i will be able to not answer them .","the industrial designer gave his presentation on the basic functions of the remote . he presented the basic components that remotes share and suggested that smaller batteries be considered in the product design . the user interface designer presented his ideas for making the remote easy-to-use; he discussed using a simple design and hiding complicated features from the main interface . the marketing expert presented the findings from a lab study on user requirements for a remote control device , and discussed users' demand for a simple interface and advanced technology . the project manager presented the new requirements that the remote not include a teletext function , that it be used only to control television , and that it include the company image in its design . the group narrowed down their target marketing group to the youth market . they discussed the functions the remote will have , including video plus capability and rechargeable batteries . a customer service plan was suggested to make the remote seem more user-friendly , but it was decided that helpful manuals were more within the budget . the group then discussed the shell-like shape of the remote and including several different casing options to buyers . the marketing expert will research consumers' opinions on instruction manuals . it was decided that the group will produce one product design instead of creating alternate designs in an attempt to accomodate different users' preferences . the marketing will be focused towards a young , business-class buyer . the remote will feature video plus capabilities and a seashell-like shape to accomodate the lcd display and the flip screen . the remote will be bundled with a docking station to recharge the remote's batteries and a user-friendly instruction manual , and multiple casings will be made available . the limitations of the budget will restrict the development of some features; several of the features that the group wanted to include may have to be made simpler to decrease cost .
","the marketing expert presented an analysis of existing remote controls to help decide what features to include in the prototype . the industrial designer presented options for reducing the size of the device and included information about the types of batteries commonly used . he discussed using an lcd screen to simplify the interface on the remote , and discussed using a flip-open design for easier use with the group. the user interface designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the options for adding features such as voice recognition , a menu for changing channel , or a lock button to access the menu on the television . this led to a discussion on the group's decision to include a scroll wheel for changing channels and volume settings . they discussed using triple a d screen for the remote and having a large capacity for the main interface , to use a circular battery for power source and using rechargeable battery type of battery to help keep the cost of components . after the project manager's closing , the group discussed their budget and working design , which had to wait for two more information . then the industrial specialist was instructed to prepare a prototype evaluation .",,,,,,X,,,10.0,T5-Cons
12,"project manager : hello everyone .
industrial designer : hi .
user interface designer : hi .
marketing executive : hi .
project manager : how we doing ?
industrial designer : good .
project manager : first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering i suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it is also an item that people lose a lot . so we should address that . and , it should be something s that is very simple to use . in addition to that to make it sell , the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive , or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that is a very important fact , if they say , i go home and think about it , that wo not work . also mentioned was it should be it should have a very short learning curve . and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan . our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip that has infra - red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip . therefore , messages will be controlled in the same manner . there should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep . if too many buttons are pressed , child lock and maybe a display clock so that people could you could see the time , what show they want to watch . also mentioned was maybe different shapes . so the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra - red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and maybe some a holder for the item . francino who is our
user interface designer : interface designer .
project manager : interface designer has mentioned that the that it , should have an on - off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock . particularly with maybe small children that they could not watch a channel that is undesirable . it should be compact . her personal favourite was it should be t - shaped . and maybe have an anar alarm - clock . and the material should possibly be not of non - allergic nature . the different systems that exist are infra - red or radio - waves . maybe it should have electri electrici electricity saving feature . and even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite program on th right from the remote .
user interface designer : yes .
project manager : are we all in agreement that is about what we discussed last time ?
marketing executive : that is it .
project manager : then we i am looking for three presentations . and i whether the order matters much , i do not , so whoever w wants
user interface designer : start first .
project manager : .
user interface designer : now my slide , .
project manager : your slides . , come on , close already . and that is number two , right ?
user interface designer : three .
project manager : three .
user interface designer : participant three . now as an interface designer , i would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers . now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television . this messages could be switch on - off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel , like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine .
project manager : nine what ? nine channel switches ?
user interface designer : pardon me ?
project manager : nine channel switches ?
user interface designer : yes , nine numbers . and then you have swapping of button
project manager :  .
user interface designer : by which using which you can swap the channels if you do not want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa . then it should have a next button , and next button channel by which you can keep on v scrolling the channels one by one .
industrial designer : going to the nex next .
user interface designer : next slide , . then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume . then , there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television . , if you are watching a french program and you would like to have a subtitles in english , then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the subtitles on the screen . then there should d there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture . now there should be a memory switch . there should be a mute button . suddenly if viewer he gets a telephone call , and if he want he does not want to switch off the t_v _ , but he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can while talking he can watch the t_v _ . now the most important feature i would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature . it is an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit . so a remote can be th can be designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , th now the , the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel . so the t_v _ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user is voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities . so this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have . so this is one of the interface which can be created . a very simple interface which has all the t important features . then , next slide . then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons . so sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that . so you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user - friendly . even a kid can use that . so can you go on t to the next slide . , so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser . and this has multi - purpose use , it can be used for t_v _ , it can be used for cable - satellite , it can be used for v_c_r _ , d_v_d_s and audio . and this has in - built voice recogniser . can you go on to the next slide ? , now this is an interface for a chil for a remote which a child can use . this is user - friendly , it is very attractive and children can use it as they can play with it . and this comes with different colours , different shapes . and this child interface has minimum buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small , compact , attractive child interface . now this is a big over - sized remote which can not be misplaced or it is impossible to misplace .
marketing executive : you me .
user interface designer : this .
marketing executive : i could lose that in a minute .
user interface designer : so this is no this is a very big , you can not misplace it anywhere . so this is a jumbo universal remote control and it is impossible to i m misplace or lose . this i this is one such interface which can be created . and the personal preference would be a spe to incorporate speech recognisers which will respond to user is voice for a particular function .
project manager : right .
user interface designer : that is
project manager : very much . any comments on her presentation ?
marketing executive : looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there .
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : what i am no suggestion is bad .
user interface designer : yes .
marketing executive : but we are gonna have to narrow it down a little more . i do not think that we can get the t - shape is good , the child one is good , the too big to misplace , it is just funny . i do not think that is gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter .
project manager : i th
marketing executive : it is it is gonna be a little bit too unwieldy .
project manager : no , the these are her presentations , but as far as the decision making we getting to that after
marketing executive :  . have to come back to that later .
user interface designer : we can .
project manager : but if wanted to know whether anybody had any anything to add to her presentation .
marketing executive : no , her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options .
project manager : right . ho who wants to go next ? ,
industrial designer : maybe .
project manager : and you
industrial designer : participant two . the next one , . it is it was the old one .
project manager : the components design .
industrial designer : components .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : this time i am going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design . , can you go on to the next slide , . i have just brief down few components which we require for the remote control construction . the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , it is like it can be a plastic one , hard plastic , so that it can be strong , even if you just , if you if it falls down , then it does not break . so it should be strong . and there are no harmful materials used in that . and it should be recyclable . and ,
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : and also using of colouring compon components like if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so we have to use some colouring compone components . and the second important thing is integrated circuit . which we can use a highly sophisticated one because it is like the heart of the remote controller . if it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be like the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one . and it should be resistant to high as low temperatures . suppose if it is thirty - eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should be able to re resist the temperature highs and high temperatures and low temperatures . and it should be with equipped with timer and alarm facility . and the other component we should we have in the remote controller is a resistor which is like i it is very much important for the electricity flow through the remote controller and also a capacitor which is a b which is a m it is like a battery , capacitor . can you go on to the next slide , ? a diode , a transistor , a resonator , these are all this technical electri electronic compons components which are which we have to use in a remote controller . a battery , i would like to suggest one thing if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , even if it is a low performance battery it ca it ca not l it ca not charge much . it it is not a high voltage battery . then also we can if it is a rechargeable one , then people can use it for a long time , so in that way we can cut the cost , but w that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one . and we have a circuit board in a remote controller . can you go to the next slide , . and how it works , how the remote controller works .
project manager : go away .
industrial designer : when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection that means when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , and then the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the chip will know that the number one button was pressed . it pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button . every button , every individual button , has its own morse code . suppose the user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the l_e_d _ which translates the signal into infrared light . like you have got a signal by pressing a button . that is a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit . now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor . that is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller . it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the l_e_d _ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . the sensor on the t_v _ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will know which what action it has to do . then it will do the appropriate action . so this is how the remote controller works .
user interface designer : it works .
industrial designer : i have few pictures . when you look at the remote controller it is it this is a normal remote controller . and to the next slide , . and where we had a few buttons and all . and if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins , and also a capac a capacitor , three resistors and also a resonator and di and a diode transistor . the electronic components all of the electronic components have all those things like a chip and d diode transistors an , di can y you can see the t_a _ double one eight three five labelled chip .
marketing executive : yes .
industrial designer : you can also see the green two green things are these are they are resistors , and just beside that you can see a transistor , and a cylinder shape , that one is a capacitor . and also there are resistors , ther there is a diode . can you go on to the next slide . so this is the circuit board . the green one is a circuit board . actually , building a circuit bo board is pretty easy and also it is a l inexpensive . it is it costs less than what you print on a paper , because when you are building some circuits and also wires , it is better to go for printing , because you can build these k circuit boards on a bulk and it is just printing , nothing like , you do not need to use wires and all . it is not exactly wires we are using . it is just printing something on a board . tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci circuits . so th that green thing is a circuit board , and also you can see there are b s like access for buttons , like when you press a button , the circuit under the button will be activated th it will he get some signals from it and it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the , integrated circuit .
user interface designer : transmit .
industrial designer : so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons . can you see the black , round marks ? they they are the circuits . and like we have designed before we have seen some few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls . b but a b a push - button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and k full a complete chip . and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious hard dynamo , a kinetic provision of energy , more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . so that also we can have in a battery , or we can use solar sells .
marketing executive : that is interesting .
industrial designer : the product can be de delivered into different cases . usually , the cases and card flat that w we see usually d a normal remote controller .
project manager : and you have more pictures . we have five minutes to the end of the meeting .
industrial designer : maybe d i have just one more slide , . like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we ca not use . and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular re or an advanced chip on the print , also infra it includes the infrared se sender . the for the movie just to j develop samples and so spe sample speaker . an , that is it . it is all for me now ,
project manager : any particular comments by anybody ?
marketing executive : on the scroll and the push - button , ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ?
industrial designer : no , no , th the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , which we used to do before ten years before , . now , nobody uses that because you need a k sophisticated chip and all . so it is better we go for ordinary buttons .
marketing executive : we will just go for push buttons
industrial designer : push - buttons .
user interface designer : push - buttons .
marketing executive : for in the interest of cost .
project manager : we do not have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision , and the marketing expert has to present her thing .
marketing executive : go right to my first my next slide . alright , my method is i am interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so i have really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . i s i spend a lot of time on the internet surfing around doing the same thing . and then when i am out in people is houses or at meetings or anything like that , i try to notice what remote controls people have , and if it is convenient in the conversation i ask about it . and i would encourage you all to do the same . and my findings from this is that , small is beautiful . people like something that really fits in their hand . simple is beautiful . they do not want to have to squint at small print , they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want as few buttons as possible , and they do not care for the mode thing . they want each button to do something . and eye - catching is important . it is got ta look cute , it is got ta look appealing . go ahead , i am trying to finish fast for you . and our preference is , as far as i am concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others , so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their christmas item . and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . if we try to tell people it has too many great features , the consumer just gets confused and we do not get anywhere . so we have got ta narrow our selection down to li two things , that we gonna say are really great about our new product . and i have been looking around at what designs every year different things are popular . and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . they are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them . so those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item .
project manager : that concludes the presentation of everyone . and what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote . and so what do we think on the concept of the remote ?
marketing executive : you wanna try to come back to yours , and limit yours a bit ?
project manager : y
user interface designer : yes , i would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser .
marketing executive : so speech recognition is most important as far as you are concerned ?
user interface designer : this could be one feature which could be sellable .
industrial designer : but w
marketing executive : h that could be our star feature .
project manager : that is
marketing executive : that that be really good , i agree with that .
industrial designer : but i what i am very much doubtful how far it will work , because a speech recogniser like i it has its own problems , issues .
marketing executive : distance problem ?
industrial designer : it is not distance problem it is recognising a person is voice , like maybe different people will be having different voices , so it like it is everything so i
project manager : you teach you have to teach
industrial designer : so to get a good recogni recognising system , it is a costly thing , .
user interface designer : no , it is like your recording of all a question already , and then you are expecting an answer from th , you have a t_v _ system , i am the user and my family members are the user , i will already record a question like , good morning ,
industrial designer : but
user interface designer : like around eight o'clock i want to see the news in the television . so i will say just good morning and the t_v _ will switch on . it will recognise my voice and will switch on .
project manager : before we get too far off here , the components of the concept is the energy . what energy do we foresee ?
marketing executive : battery ,
user interface designer : battery .
marketing executive : and we all on that . that that is gonna be most cost - effective and the best thing .
project manager : then chip on print . and we all agree on the case , we wanna have something maybe bright , colourful .
marketing executive : bright , colourful , trendy design , and strong .
user interface designer : and compact .
industrial designer : and also strong .
user interface designer : trendy design and compact .
industrial designer : trendy , .
project manager : trendy design , compact and strong . user interface concept , interface type , supplements that will be your area , right , jana .
industrial designer : like the switches , like we use buttons for user interface .
project manager : put k i for
industrial designer : push - buttons .
project manager : and not what they mean by supplements .
user interface designer : and supplements like different types of features buttons , like can have a f mute button or a swapping button .
marketing executive : that ,
project manager : like
marketing executive : or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement .
project manager : a what ?
marketing executive : her speech recognition feature would be a supplement .
project manager : right , right ,  .
user interface designer : recogniser .
marketing executive : so why do not we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is .
project manager : . our next meeting will be in thirty minutes , and the i_d _ is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , and the u_i_d _ is supposed to come up with the user interface design , and the marketing expert with the product evaluation . in this phase , the two of you , jana and francine , have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay , it says here . you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches . if you have any questions , you can always contact me or your coach , i suppose .
marketing executive : wherever they are hiding ?
project manager : so we conclude the meeting here and we come back in thirty minutes , according to our timetable here .","the project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting . the interface specialist begins her presentation by highlighting important remote functions and showing examples of remote interfaces . the group comments on her presentation , and then the industrial designer begins presenting . she talks about the technical electronic components of the remote , explains how a remote works , and shows a few pictures revealing the insides of a normal remote control . she suggests giving the remote a strong shell so it is durable , using a rechargable battery , and not adding a scroll wheel because it requires a sophisticated chip . the marketing expert presents , talking about user preferences for a small , simple , eye-catching , cute , appealing , and functional remote . fruit and vegetable shapes are popular this year , so a soft , spongy remote perhaps covered with cloth could make the item marketable . the group discusses the issues surrounding speech recognition , noting that if it is good quality it could be costly . they about the power source and review the objectives of the product . the project manager closes the meeting by telling each member what task she is to complete . the marketing expert will do the product evaluation . the industrial designer and interface specialist will work together on a prototype using modeling clay . the industrial designer will come up with a user interface design . their coaches will send specific instructions and answer questions . they decided that the product should be bright , colorful , trendy in design , strong , compact , have push buttons , and contain supplement features (possibly mute button , swapping button , voice recognition). the power source will be batteries because it is cost-effective . they will have the industrial engineer do more research on the cost of voice recognition before deciding whether to include that function . the group would like to include voice recognition as a feature , but they are not sure about how much it would cost . this will require further research by the industrial engineer .
","the project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting . the interface designer discussed the basic functions of a remote and suggested that a remote should have an on-off button , a switch to next channel , volume switch , mute and a number of buttons for changing channels . the marketing expert discussed the features that would make a desirable remote . she suggested that the remote should be small , be easy to use and not include too many buttons . the industrial designer presented options for energy sources , chips , case shapes and buttons , and programming options . the user interface designer then discussed voice recognition with the group . the group decided to use an infra-red chip to power the device . the remote will have a nine channel switch , and will feature a beeping noise when a user is trying to switch between channels . there will also be a small number pad for the remote which users can use to program their favorite programs . the programmable ""favorites"" button will be included on the remote . the size of the device will be 12.5 mm . the buttons will be normal colored , with one for volume control and another for channel selection . the display will be made of plastic with rubber grips . to add more features , the group discussed using rechargeable batteries , an rechargable stand , and a locator function . na .",X,,,,,,,,6.0,BART-Baseline
13,"project manager : hello everyone .
industrial designer : hi .
user interface designer : hi .
marketing executive : hi .
project manager : how we doing ?
industrial designer : good .
project manager : first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering i suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it is also an item that people lose a lot . so we should address that . and , it should be something s that is very simple to use . in addition to that to make it sell , the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive , or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that is a very important fact , if they say , i go home and think about it , that wo not work . also mentioned was it should be it should have a very short learning curve . and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan . our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip that has infra - red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip . therefore , messages will be controlled in the same manner . there should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep . if too many buttons are pressed , child lock and maybe a display clock so that people could you could see the time , what show they want to watch . also mentioned was maybe different shapes . so the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra - red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and maybe some a holder for the item . francino who is our
user interface designer : interface designer .
project manager : interface designer has mentioned that the that it , should have an on - off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock . particularly with maybe small children that they could not watch a channel that is undesirable . it should be compact . her personal favourite was it should be t - shaped . and maybe have an anar alarm - clock . and the material should possibly be not of non - allergic nature . the different systems that exist are infra - red or radio - waves . maybe it should have electri electrici electricity saving feature . and even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite program on th right from the remote .
user interface designer : yes .
project manager : are we all in agreement that is about what we discussed last time ?
marketing executive : that is it .
project manager : then we i am looking for three presentations . and i whether the order matters much , i do not , so whoever w wants
user interface designer : start first .
project manager : .
user interface designer : now my slide , .
project manager : your slides . , come on , close already . and that is number two , right ?
user interface designer : three .
project manager : three .
user interface designer : participant three . now as an interface designer , i would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers . now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television . this messages could be switch on - off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel , like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine .
project manager : nine what ? nine channel switches ?
user interface designer : pardon me ?
project manager : nine channel switches ?
user interface designer : yes , nine numbers . and then you have swapping of button
project manager :  .
user interface designer : by which using which you can swap the channels if you do not want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa . then it should have a next button , and next button channel by which you can keep on v scrolling the channels one by one .
industrial designer : going to the nex next .
user interface designer : next slide , . then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume . then , there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television . , if you are watching a french program and you would like to have a subtitles in english , then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the subtitles on the screen . then there should d there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture . now there should be a memory switch . there should be a mute button . suddenly if viewer he gets a telephone call , and if he want he does not want to switch off the t_v _ , but he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can while talking he can watch the t_v _ . now the most important feature i would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature . it is an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit . so a remote can be th can be designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , th now the , the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel . so the t_v _ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user is voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities . so this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have . so this is one of the interface which can be created . a very simple interface which has all the t important features . then , next slide . then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons . so sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that . so you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user - friendly . even a kid can use that . so can you go on t to the next slide . , so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser . and this has multi - purpose use , it can be used for t_v _ , it can be used for cable - satellite , it can be used for v_c_r _ , d_v_d_s and audio . and this has in - built voice recogniser . can you go on to the next slide ? , now this is an interface for a chil for a remote which a child can use . this is user - friendly , it is very attractive and children can use it as they can play with it . and this comes with different colours , different shapes . and this child interface has minimum buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small , compact , attractive child interface . now this is a big over - sized remote which can not be misplaced or it is impossible to misplace .
marketing executive : you me .
user interface designer : this .
marketing executive : i could lose that in a minute .
user interface designer : so this is no this is a very big , you can not misplace it anywhere . so this is a jumbo universal remote control and it is impossible to i m misplace or lose . this i this is one such interface which can be created . and the personal preference would be a spe to incorporate speech recognisers which will respond to user is voice for a particular function .
project manager : right .
user interface designer : that is
project manager : very much . any comments on her presentation ?
marketing executive : looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there .
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : what i am no suggestion is bad .
user interface designer : yes .
marketing executive : but we are gonna have to narrow it down a little more . i do not think that we can get the t - shape is good , the child one is good , the too big to misplace , it is just funny . i do not think that is gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter .
project manager : i th
marketing executive : it is it is gonna be a little bit too unwieldy .
project manager : no , the these are her presentations , but as far as the decision making we getting to that after
marketing executive :  . have to come back to that later .
user interface designer : we can .
project manager : but if wanted to know whether anybody had any anything to add to her presentation .
marketing executive : no , her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options .
project manager : right . ho who wants to go next ? ,
industrial designer : maybe .
project manager : and you
industrial designer : participant two . the next one , . it is it was the old one .
project manager : the components design .
industrial designer : components .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : this time i am going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design . , can you go on to the next slide , . i have just brief down few components which we require for the remote control construction . the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , it is like it can be a plastic one , hard plastic , so that it can be strong , even if you just , if you if it falls down , then it does not break . so it should be strong . and there are no harmful materials used in that . and it should be recyclable . and ,
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : and also using of colouring compon components like if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so we have to use some colouring compone components . and the second important thing is integrated circuit . which we can use a highly sophisticated one because it is like the heart of the remote controller . if it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be like the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one . and it should be resistant to high as low temperatures . suppose if it is thirty - eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should be able to re resist the temperature highs and high temperatures and low temperatures . and it should be with equipped with timer and alarm facility . and the other component we should we have in the remote controller is a resistor which is like i it is very much important for the electricity flow through the remote controller and also a capacitor which is a b which is a m it is like a battery , capacitor . can you go on to the next slide , ? a diode , a transistor , a resonator , these are all this technical electri electronic compons components which are which we have to use in a remote controller . a battery , i would like to suggest one thing if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , even if it is a low performance battery it ca it ca not l it ca not charge much . it it is not a high voltage battery . then also we can if it is a rechargeable one , then people can use it for a long time , so in that way we can cut the cost , but w that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one . and we have a circuit board in a remote controller . can you go to the next slide , . and how it works , how the remote controller works .
project manager : go away .
industrial designer : when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection that means when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , and then the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the chip will know that the number one button was pressed . it pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button . every button , every individual button , has its own morse code . suppose the user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the l_e_d _ which translates the signal into infrared light . like you have got a signal by pressing a button . that is a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit . now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor . that is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller . it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the l_e_d _ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . the sensor on the t_v _ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will know which what action it has to do . then it will do the appropriate action . so this is how the remote controller works .
user interface designer : it works .
industrial designer : i have few pictures . when you look at the remote controller it is it this is a normal remote controller . and to the next slide , . and where we had a few buttons and all . and if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins , and also a capac a capacitor , three resistors and also a resonator and di and a diode transistor . the electronic components all of the electronic components have all those things like a chip and d diode transistors an , di can y you can see the t_a _ double one eight three five labelled chip .
marketing executive : yes .
industrial designer : you can also see the green two green things are these are they are resistors , and just beside that you can see a transistor , and a cylinder shape , that one is a capacitor . and also there are resistors , ther there is a diode . can you go on to the next slide . so this is the circuit board . the green one is a circuit board . actually , building a circuit bo board is pretty easy and also it is a l inexpensive . it is it costs less than what you print on a paper , because when you are building some circuits and also wires , it is better to go for printing , because you can build these k circuit boards on a bulk and it is just printing , nothing like , you do not need to use wires and all . it is not exactly wires we are using . it is just printing something on a board . tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci circuits . so th that green thing is a circuit board , and also you can see there are b s like access for buttons , like when you press a button , the circuit under the button will be activated th it will he get some signals from it and it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the , integrated circuit .
user interface designer : transmit .
industrial designer : so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons . can you see the black , round marks ? they they are the circuits . and like we have designed before we have seen some few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls . b but a b a push - button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and k full a complete chip . and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious hard dynamo , a kinetic provision of energy , more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . so that also we can have in a battery , or we can use solar sells .
marketing executive : that is interesting .
industrial designer : the product can be de delivered into different cases . usually , the cases and card flat that w we see usually d a normal remote controller .
project manager : and you have more pictures . we have five minutes to the end of the meeting .
industrial designer : maybe d i have just one more slide , . like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we ca not use . and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular re or an advanced chip on the print , also infra it includes the infrared se sender . the for the movie just to j develop samples and so spe sample speaker . an , that is it . it is all for me now ,
project manager : any particular comments by anybody ?
marketing executive : on the scroll and the push - button , ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ?
industrial designer : no , no , th the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , which we used to do before ten years before , . now , nobody uses that because you need a k sophisticated chip and all . so it is better we go for ordinary buttons .

project manager : in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering i suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it is also an item that people lose a lot . so we should address that . and , it should be something s that is very simple to use . in addition to that to make it sell , the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive , or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that is a very important fact , if they say , i go home and think about it , that wo not work . also mentioned was it should be it should have a very short learning curve . and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan . our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip that has infra - red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip . therefore , messages will be controlled in the same manner . there should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep . if too many buttons are pressed , child lock and maybe a display clock so that people could you could see the time , what show they want to watch . also mentioned was maybe different shapes . so the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra - red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and maybe some a holder for the item . francino who is our
user interface designer : interface designer .
project manager : interface designer has mentioned that the that it , should have an on - off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock . particularly with maybe small children that they could not watch a channel that is undesirable . it should be compact . her personal favourite was it should be t - shaped . and maybe have an anar alarm - clock . and the material should possibly be not of non - allergic nature . the different systems that exist are infra - red or radio - waves . maybe it should have electri electrici electricity saving feature . and even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite program on th right from the remote .
user interface designer : yes .
project manager : are we all in agreement that is about what we discussed last time ?
marketing executive : that is it .
project manager : then we i am looking for three presentations . and i whether the order matters much , i do not , so whoever w wants
user interface designer : start first .
project manager : .
user interface designer : now my slide , .
project manager : your slides . , come on , close already . and that is number two , right ?
user interface designer : three .
project manager : three .
user interface designer : participant three . now as an interface designer , i would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers . now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television . this messages could be switch on - off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel , like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine .
project manager : nine what ? nine channel switches ?
user interface designer : pardon me ?
project manager : nine channel switches ?
user interface designer : yes , nine numbers . and then you have swapping of button
project manager :  .
user interface designer : by which using which you can swap the channels if you do not want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa . then it should have a next button , and next button channel by which you can keep on v scrolling the channels one by one .
industrial designer : going to the nex next .
user interface designer : next slide , . then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume . then , there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television . , if you are watching a french program and you would like to have a subtitles in english , then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the subtitles on the screen . then there should d there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture . now there should be a memory switch . there should be a mute button . suddenly if viewer he gets a telephone call , and if he want he does not want to switch off the t_v _ , but he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can while talking he can watch the t_v _ . now the most important feature i would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature . it is an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit . so a remote can be th can be designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , th now the , the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel . so the t_v _ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user is voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities . so this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have . so this is one of the interface which can be created . a very simple interface which has all the t important features . then , next slide . then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons . so sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that . so you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user - friendly . even a kid can use that . so can you go on t to the next slide . , so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser . and this has multi - purpose use , it can be used for t_v _ , it can be used for cable - satellite , it can be used for v_c_r _ , d_v_d_s and audio . and this has in - built voice recogniser . can you go on to the next slide ? , now this is an interface for a chil for a remote which a child can use . this is user - friendly , it is very attractive and children can use it as they can play with it . and this comes with different colours , different shapes . and this child interface has minimum buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small , compact , attractive child interface . now this is a big over - sized remote which can not be misplaced or it is impossible to misplace .
marketing executive : you me .
user interface designer : this .
marketing executive : i could lose that in a minute .
user interface designer : so this is no this is a very big , you can not misplace it anywhere . so this is a jumbo universal remote control and it is impossible to i m misplace or lose . this i this is one such interface which can be created . and the personal preference would be a spe to incorporate speech recognisers which will respond to user is voice for a particular function .
project manager : right .
user interface designer : that is
project manager : very much . any comments on her presentation ?
marketing executive : looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there .
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : what i am no suggestion is bad .
user interface designer : yes .
marketing executive : but we are gonna have to narrow it down a little more . i do not think that we can get the t - shape is good , the child one is good , the too big to misplace , it is just funny . i do not think that is gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter .
project manager : i th
marketing executive : it is it is gonna be a little bit too unwieldy .
project manager : no , the these are her presentations , but as far as the decision making we getting to that after
marketing executive :  . have to come back to that later .
user interface designer : we can .
project manager : but if wanted to know whether anybody had any anything to add to her presentation .
marketing executive : no , her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options .
project manager : right . ho who wants to go next ? ,
industrial designer : maybe .
project manager : and you
industrial designer : participant two . the next one , . it is it was the old one .
project manager : the components design .
industrial designer : components .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : this time i am going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design . , can you go on to the next slide , . i have just brief down few components which we require for the remote control construction . the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , it is like it can be a plastic one , hard plastic , so that it can be strong , even if you just , if you if it falls down , then it does not break . so it should be strong . and there are no harmful materials used in that . and it should be recyclable . and ,
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : and also using of colouring compon components like if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so we have to use some colouring compone components . and the second important thing is integrated circuit . which we can use a highly sophisticated one because it is like the heart of the remote controller . if it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be like the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one . and it should be resistant to high as low temperatures . suppose if it is thirty - eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should be able to re resist the temperature highs and high temperatures and low temperatures . and it should be with equipped with timer and alarm facility . and the other component we should we have in the remote controller is a resistor which is like i it is very much important for the electricity flow through the remote controller and also a capacitor which is a b which is a m it is like a battery , capacitor . can you go on to the next slide , ? a diode , a transistor , a resonator , these are all this technical electri electronic compons components which are which we have to use in a remote controller . a battery , i would like to suggest one thing if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , even if it is a low performance battery it ca it ca not l it ca not charge much . it it is not a high voltage battery . then also we can if it is a rechargeable one , then people can use it for a long time , so in that way we can cut the cost , but w that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one . and we have a circuit board in a remote controller . can you go to the next slide , . and how it works , how the remote controller works .
project manager : go away .
industrial designer : when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection that means when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , and then the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the chip will know that the number one button was pressed . it pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button . every button , every individual button , has its own morse code . suppose the user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the l_e_d _ which translates the signal into infrared light . like you have got a signal by pressing a button . that is a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit . now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor . that is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller . it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the l_e_d _ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . the sensor on the t_v _ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will know which what action it has to do . then it will do the appropriate action . so this is how the remote controller works .
user interface designer : it works .
industrial designer : i have few pictures . when you look at the remote controller it is it this is a normal remote controller . and to the next slide , . and where we had a few buttons and all . and if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins , and also a capac a capacitor , three resistors and also a resonator and di and a diode transistor . the electronic components all of the electronic components have all those things like a chip and d diode transistors an , di can y you can see the t_a _ double one eight three five labelled chip .
marketing executive : yes .
industrial designer : you can also see the green two green things are these are they are resistors , and just beside that you can see a transistor , and a cylinder shape , that one is a capacitor . and also there are resistors , ther there is a diode . can you go on to the next slide . so this is the circuit board . the green one is a circuit board . actually , building a circuit bo board is pretty easy and also it is a l inexpensive . it is it costs less than what you print on a paper , because when you are building some circuits and also wires , it is better to go for printing , because you can build these k circuit boards on a bulk and it is just printing , nothing like , you do not need to use wires and all . it is not exactly wires we are using . it is just printing something on a board . tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci circuits . so th that green thing is a circuit board , and also you can see there are b s like access for buttons , like when you press a button , the circuit under the button will be activated th it will he get some signals from it and it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the , integrated circuit .
user interface designer : transmit .
industrial designer : so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons . can you see the black , round marks ? they they are the circuits . and like we have designed before we have seen some few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls . b but a b a push - button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and k full a complete chip . and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious hard dynamo , a kinetic provision of energy , more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . so that also we can have in a battery , or we can use solar sells .
marketing executive : that is interesting .
industrial designer : the product can be de delivered into different cases . usually , the cases and card flat that w we see usually d a normal remote controller .
project manager : and you have more pictures . we have five minutes to the end of the meeting .
industrial designer : maybe d i have just one more slide , . like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we ca not use . and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular re or an advanced chip on the print , also infra it includes the infrared se sender . the for the movie just to j develop samples and so spe sample speaker . an , that is it . it is all for me now ,
project manager : any particular comments by anybody ?
marketing executive : on the scroll and the push - button , ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ?
industrial designer : no , no , th the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , which we used to do before ten years before , . now , nobody uses that because you need a k sophisticated chip and all . so it is better we go for ordinary buttons .
marketing executive : we will just go for push buttons
industrial designer : push - buttons .
user interface designer : push - buttons .
marketing executive : for in the interest of cost .
project manager : we do not have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision , and the marketing expert has to present her thing .
marketing executive : go right to my first my next slide . alright , my method is i am interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so i have really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . i s i spend a lot of time on the internet surfing around doing the same thing . and then when i am out in people is houses or at meetings or anything like that , i try to notice what remote controls people have , and if it is convenient in the conversation i ask about it . and i would encourage you all to do the same . and my findings from this is that , small is beautiful . people like something that really fits in their hand . simple is beautiful . they do not want to have to squint at small print , they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want as few buttons as possible , and they do not care for the mode thing . they want each button to do something . and eye - catching is important . it is got ta look cute , it is got ta look appealing . go ahead , i am trying to finish fast for you . and our preference is , as far as i am concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others , so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their christmas item . and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . if we try to tell people it has too many great features , the consumer just gets confused and we do not get anywhere . so we have got ta narrow our selection down to li two things , that we gonna say are really great about our new product . and i have been looking around at what designs every year different things are popular . and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . they are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them . so those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item .
project manager : that concludes the presentation of everyone . and what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote . and so what do we think on the concept of the remote ?
marketing executive : you wanna try to come back to yours , and limit yours a bit ?
project manager : y
user interface designer : yes , i would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser .
marketing executive : so speech recognition is most important as far as you are concerned ?
user interface designer : this could be one feature which could be sellable .
industrial designer : but w
marketing executive : h that could be our star feature .
project manager : that is
marketing executive : that that be really good , i agree with that .
industrial designer : but i what i am very much doubtful how far it will work , because a speech recogniser like i it has its own problems , issues .
marketing executive : distance problem ?
industrial designer : it is not distance problem it is recognising a person is voice , like maybe different people will be having different voices , so it like it is everything so i
project manager : you teach you have to teach
industrial designer : so to get a good recogni recognising system , it is a costly thing , .
user interface designer : no , it is like your recording of all a question already , and then you are expecting an answer from th , you have a t_v _ system , i am the user and my family members are the user , i will already record a question like , good morning ,
industrial designer : but
user interface designer : like around eight o'clock i want to see the news in the television . so i will say just good morning and the t_v _ will switch on . it will recognise my voice and will switch on .
project manager : before we get too far off here , the components of the concept is the energy . what energy do we foresee ?
marketing executive : battery ,
user interface designer : battery .
marketing executive : and we all on that . that that is gonna be most cost - effective and the best thing .
project manager : then chip on print . and we all agree on the case , we wanna have something maybe bright , colourful .
marketing executive : bright , colourful , trendy design , and strong .
user interface designer : and compact .
industrial designer : and also strong .
user interface designer : trendy design and compact .
industrial designer : trendy , .
project manager : trendy design , compact and strong . user interface concept , interface type , supplements that will be your area , right , jana .
industrial designer : like the switches , like we use buttons for user interface .
project manager : put k i for
industrial designer : push - buttons .
project manager : and not what they mean by supplements .
user interface designer : and supplements like different types of features buttons , like can have a f mute button or a swapping button .
marketing executive : that ,
project manager : like
marketing executive : or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement .
project manager : a what ?
marketing executive : her speech recognition feature would be a supplement .
project manager : right , right ,  .
user interface designer : recogniser .
marketing executive : so why do not we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is .
project manager : . our next meeting will be in thirty minutes , and the i_d _ is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , and the u_i_d _ is supposed to come up with the user interface design , and the marketing expert with the product evaluation . in this phase , the two of you , jana and francine , have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay , it says here . you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches . if you have any questions , you can always contact me or your coach , i suppose .
marketing executive : wherever they are hiding ?
project manager : so we conclude the meeting here and we come back in thirty minutes , according to our timetable here .","the project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting . the interface specialist begins her presentation by highlighting important remote functions and showing examples of remote interfaces . the group comments on her presentation , and then the industrial designer begins presenting . she talks about the technical electronic components of the remote , explains how a remote works , and shows a few pictures revealing the insides of a normal remote control . she suggests giving the remote a strong shell so it is durable , using a rechargable battery , and not adding a scroll wheel because it requires a sophisticated chip . the marketing expert presents , talking about user preferences for a small , simple , eye-catching , cute , appealing , and functional remote . fruit and vegetable shapes are popular this year , so a soft , spongy remote perhaps covered with cloth could make the item marketable . the group discusses the issues surrounding speech recognition , noting that if it is good quality it could be costly . they about the power source and review the objectives of the product . the project manager closes the meeting by telling each member what task she is to complete . the marketing expert will do the product evaluation . the industrial designer and interface specialist will work together on a prototype using modeling clay . the industrial designer will come up with a user interface design . their coaches will send specific instructions and answer questions . they decided that the product should be bright , colorful , trendy in design , strong , compact , have push buttons , and contain supplement features (possibly mute button , swapping button , voice recognition). the power source will be batteries because it is cost-effective . they will have the industrial engineer do more research on the cost of voice recognition before deciding whether to include that function . the group would like to include voice recognition as a feature , but they are not sure about how much it would cost . this will require further research by the industrial engineer .
","the project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting . the user interface designer discussed the functions of the remote and suggested that the remote should have an on-off button , channel switch , volume switch , and a small number of buttons for changing channels . the marketing expert discussed the features that a desirable remote would have . the interface designer stressed the need for the remote to be attractive and to be easy to use . the industrial designer presented possible components for the device , discussed the energy sources that would be used , and discussed the shape and color of the device . the program specialist gave a presentation on trend watching and emphasized that products should be innovative , useful , beautiful , functional , solar-powered , have a locator function , and be compatible with all television brands . the group discussed integrating a solar cell into the design . the materials that will be used will be plastic and rubber . the remote will have buttons for power , channel selection , volume control , mute and channel up/down , and nine numbered channel buttons . the device will feature an infra-red chip . the processor will be powered by solar cells . the case will be made of plastic with rubber grips . meeting the target cost . whether to include a child lock component .",X,,,,,X,X,,7.0,BART-Cons

industrial designer : and also using of colouring compon components like if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so we have to use some colouring compone components . and the second important thing is integrated circuit . which we can use a highly sophisticated one because it is like the heart of the remote controller . if it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be like the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one . and it should be resistant to high as low temperatures . suppose if it is thirty - eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should be able to re resist the temperature highs and high temperatures and low temperatures . and it should be with equipped with timer and alarm facility . and the other component we should we have in the remote controller is a resistor which is like i it is very much important for the electricity flow through the remote controller and also a capacitor which is a b which is a m it is like a battery , capacitor . can you go on to the next slide , ? a diode , a transistor , a resonator , these are all this technical electri electronic compons components which are which we have to use in a remote controller . a battery , i would like to suggest one thing if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , even if it is a low performance battery it ca it ca not l it ca not charge much . it it is not a high voltage battery . then also we can if it is a rechargeable one , then people can use it for a long time , so in that way we can cut the cost , but w that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one . and we have a circuit board in a remote controller . can you go to the next slide , . and how it works , how the remote controller works .
project manager : go away .
industrial designer : when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection that means when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , and then the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the chip will know that the number one button was pressed . it pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button . every button , every individual button , has its own morse code . suppose the user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the l_e_d _ which translates the signal into infrared light . like you have got a signal by pressing a button . that is a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit . now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor . that is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller . it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the l_e_d _ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . the sensor on the t_v _ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will know which what action it has to do . then it will do the appropriate action . so this is how the remote controller works .
user interface designer : it works .
industrial designer : i have few pictures . when you look at the remote controller it is it this is a normal remote controller . and to the next slide , . and where we had a few buttons and all . and if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins , and also a capac a capacitor , three resistors and also a resonator and di and a diode transistor . the electronic components all of the electronic components have all those things like a chip and d diode transistors an , di can y you can see the t_a _ double one eight three five labelled chip .
marketing executive : yes .
industrial designer : you can also see the green two green things are these are they are resistors , and just beside that you can see a transistor , and a cylinder shape , that one is a capacitor . and also there are resistors , ther there is a diode . can you go on to the next slide . so this is the circuit board . the green one is a circuit board . actually , building a circuit bo board is pretty easy and also it is a l inexpensive . it is it costs less than what you print on a paper , because when you are building some circuits and also wires , it is better to go for printing , because you can build these k circuit boards on a bulk and it is just printing , nothing like , you do not need to use wires and all . it is not exactly wires we are using . it is just printing something on a board . tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci circuits . so th that green thing is a circuit board , and also you can see there are b s like access for buttons , like when you press a button , the circuit under the button will be activated th it will he get some signals from it and it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the , integrated circuit .
user interface designer : transmit .
industrial designer : so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons . can you see the black , round marks ? they they are the circuits . and like we have designed before we have seen some few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls . b but a b a push - button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and k full a complete chip . and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious hard dynamo , a kinetic provision of energy , more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . so that also we can have in a battery , or we can use solar sells .
marketing executive : that is interesting .
industrial designer : the product can be de delivered into different cases . usually , the cases and card flat that w we see usually d a normal remote controller .
project manager : and you have more pictures . we have five minutes to the end of the meeting .
industrial designer : maybe d i have just one more slide , . like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we ca not use . and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular re or an advanced chip on the print , also infra it includes the infrared se sender . the for the movie just to j develop samples and so spe sample speaker . an , that is it . it is all for me now ,
project manager : any particular comments by anybody ?
marketing executive : on the scroll and the push - button , ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ?
industrial designer : no , no , th the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , which we used to do before ten years before , . now , nobody uses that because you need a k sophisticated chip and all . so it is better we go for ordinary buttons .
marketing executive : we will just go for push buttons
industrial designer : push - buttons .
user interface designer : push - buttons .
marketing executive : for in the interest of cost .
project manager : we do not have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision , and the marketing expert has to present her thing .
marketing executive : go right to my first my next slide . alright , my method is i am interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so i have really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . i s i spend a lot of time on the internet surfing around doing the same thing . and then when i am out in people is houses or at meetings or anything like that , i try to notice what remote controls people have , and if it is convenient in the conversation i ask about it . and i would encourage you all to do the same . and my findings from this is that , small is beautiful . people like something that really fits in their hand . simple is beautiful . they do not want to have to squint at small print , they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want as few buttons as possible , and they do not care for the mode thing . they want each button to do something . and eye - catching is important . it is got ta look cute , it is got ta look appealing . go ahead , i am trying to finish fast for you . and our preference is , as far as i am concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others , so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their christmas item . and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . if we try to tell people it has too many great features , the consumer just gets confused and we do not get anywhere . so we have got ta narrow our selection down to li two things , that we gonna say are really great about our new product . and i have been looking around at what designs every year different things are popular . and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . they are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them . so those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item .
project manager : that concludes the presentation of everyone . and what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote . and so what do we think on the concept of the remote ?
marketing executive : you wanna try to come back to yours , and limit yours a bit ?
project manager : y
user interface designer : yes , i would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser .
marketing executive : so speech recognition is most important as far as you are concerned ?
user interface designer : this could be one feature which could be sellable .
industrial designer : but w
marketing executive : h that could be our star feature .
project manager : that is
marketing executive : that that be really good , i agree with that .
industrial designer : but i what i am very much doubtful how far it will work , because a speech recogniser like i it has its own problems , issues .
marketing executive : distance problem ?
industrial designer : it is not distance problem it is recognising a person is voice , like maybe different people will be having different voices , so it like it is everything so i
project manager : you teach you have to teach
industrial designer : so to get a good recogni recognising system , it is a costly thing , .
user interface designer : no , it is like your recording of all a question already , and then you are expecting an answer from th , you have a t_v _ system , i am the user and my family members are the user , i will already record a question like , good morning ,
industrial designer : but
user interface designer : like around eight o'clock i want to see the news in the television . so i will say just good morning and the t_v _ will switch on . it will recognise my voice and will switch on .
project manager : before we get too far off here , the components of the concept is the energy . what energy do we foresee ?
marketing executive : battery ,
user interface designer : battery .
marketing executive : and we all on that . that that is gonna be most cost - effective and the best thing .
project manager : then chip on print . and we all agree on the case , we wanna have something maybe bright , colourful .
marketing executive : bright , colourful , trendy design , and strong .
user interface designer : and compact .
industrial designer : and also strong .
user interface designer : trendy design and compact .
industrial designer : trendy , .
project manager : trendy design , compact and strong . user interface concept , interface type , supplements that will be your area , right , jana .
industrial designer : like the switches , like we use buttons for user interface .
project manager : put k i for
industrial designer : push - buttons .
project manager : and not what they mean by supplements .
user interface designer : and supplements like different types of features buttons , like can have a f mute button or a swapping button .
marketing executive : that ,
project manager : like
marketing executive : or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement .
project manager : a what ?
marketing executive : her speech recognition feature would be a supplement .
project manager : right , right ,  .
user interface designer : recogniser .
marketing executive : so why do not we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is .
project manager : . our next meeting will be in thirty minutes , and the i_d _ is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , and the u_i_d _ is supposed to come up with the user interface design , and the marketing expert with the product evaluation . in this phase , the two of you , jana and francine , have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay , it says here . you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches . if you have any questions , you can always contact me or your coach , i suppose .
marketing executive : wherever they are hiding ?
project manager : so we conclude the meeting here and we come back in thirty minutes , according to our timetable here .","the project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting . the interface specialist begins her presentation by highlighting important remote functions and showing examples of remote interfaces . the group comments on her presentation , and then the industrial designer begins presenting . she talks about the technical electronic components of the remote , explains how a remote works , and shows a few pictures revealing the insides of a normal remote control . she suggests giving the remote a strong shell so it is durable , using a rechargable battery , and not adding a scroll wheel because it requires a sophisticated chip . the marketing expert presents , talking about user preferences for a small , simple , eye-catching , cute , appealing , and functional remote . fruit and vegetable shapes are popular this year , so a soft , spongy remote perhaps covered with cloth could make the item marketable . the group discusses the issues surrounding speech recognition , noting that if it is good quality it could be costly . they about the power source and review the objectives of the product . the project manager closes the meeting by telling each member what task she is to complete . the marketing expert will do the product evaluation . the industrial designer and interface specialist will work together on a prototype using modeling clay . the industrial designer will come up with a user interface design . their coaches will send specific instructions and answer questions . they decided that the product should be bright , colorful , trendy in design , strong , compact , have push buttons , and contain supplement features (possibly mute button , swapping button , voice recognition). the power source will be batteries because it is cost-effective . they will have the industrial engineer do more research on the cost of voice recognition before deciding whether to include that function . the group would like to include voice recognition as a feature , but they are not sure about how much it would cost . this will require further research by the industrial engineer .
","the project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting . the user interface designer presented more details about the interface of a remote and stressed the need for a product that is attractive , simple to use , contains infra-red technology , is small , compact , has a short learning curve , and is not difficult to misplace . she also suggested that the remote should be shaped like a tennis ball and be able to be misplaced and should not have a back-up button , while the marketing expert gave a presentation on the role of the team then discussed the option to include a club membership card in the product and the features that were discussed in the team's design , including the color scheme and the menu option to switch between two channels , to keep on/off , channel switching , switchable through either through the menu or by pressing one of the channel . this included a menu for changing channel , swapping between two or three buttons , which are shaped , in a t-shaped device , with a button for channel switching between two , three or four , depending on the user's preference . in addition a case , the remote could also contain a memory card . there was a discussion of what features the remote would include , how to make the remote sell for twenty-five euros , plus a timer with the option of using an expensive chip",,,,X,,,,,8.0,T5-Cons
16,"project manager : hello everyone .
industrial designer : hi .
user interface designer : hi .
marketing executive : hi .
project manager : how we doing ?
industrial designer : good .
project manager : first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering i suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it is also an item that people lose a lot . so we should address that . and , it should be something s that is very simple to use . in addition to that to make it sell , the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive , or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that is a very important fact , if they say , i go home and think about it , that wo not work . also mentioned was it should be it should have a very short learning curve . and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan . our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip that has infra - red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip . therefore , messages will be controlled in the same manner . there should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep . if too many buttons are pressed , child lock and maybe a display clock so that people could you could see the time , what show they want to watch . also mentioned was maybe different shapes . so the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra - red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and maybe some a holder for the item . francino who is our
user interface designer : interface designer .
project manager : interface designer has mentioned that the that it , should have an on - off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock . particularly with maybe small children that they could not watch a channel that is undesirable . it should be compact . her personal favourite was it should be t - shaped . and maybe have an anar alarm - clock . and the material should possibly be not of non - allergic nature . the different systems that exist are infra - red or radio - waves . maybe it should have electri electrici electricity saving feature . and even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite program on th right from the remote .
user interface designer : yes .
project manager : are we all in agreement that is about what we discussed last time ?
marketing executive : that is it .
project manager : then we i am looking for three presentations . and i whether the order matters much , i do not , so whoever w wants
user interface designer : start first .
project manager : .
user interface designer : now my slide , .
project manager : your slides . , come on , close already . and that is number two , right ?
user interface designer : three .
project manager : three .
user interface designer : participant three . now as an interface designer , i would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers . now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television . this messages could be switch on - off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel , like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine .
project manager : nine what ? nine channel switches ?
user interface designer : pardon me ?
project manager : nine channel switches ?
user interface designer : yes , nine numbers . and then you have swapping of button
project manager :  .
user interface designer : by which using which you can swap the channels if you do not want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa . then it should have a next button , and next button channel by which you can keep on v scrolling the channels one by one .
industrial designer : going to the nex next .
user interface designer : next slide , . then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume . then , there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television . , if you are watching a french program and you would like to have a subtitles in english , then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the subtitles on the screen . then there should d there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture . now there should be a memory switch . there should be a mute button . suddenly if viewer he gets a telephone call , and if he want he does not want to switch off the t_v _ , but he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can while talking he can watch the t_v _ . now the most important feature i would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature . it is an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit . so a remote can be th can be designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , th now the , the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel . so the t_v _ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user is voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities . so this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have . so this is one of the interface which can be created . a very simple interface which has all the t important features . then , next slide . then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons . so sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that . so you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user - friendly . even a kid can use that . so can you go on t to the next slide . , so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser . and this has multi - purpose use , it can be used for t_v _ , it can be used for cable - satellite , it can be used for v_c_r _ , d_v_d_s and audio . and this has in - built voice recogniser . can you go on to the next slide ? , now this is an interface for a chil for a remote which a child can use . this is user - friendly , it is very attractive and children can use it as they can play with it . and this comes with different colours , different shapes . and this child interface has minimum buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small , compact , attractive child interface . now this is a big over - sized remote which can not be misplaced or it is impossible to misplace .
marketing executive : you me .
user interface designer : this .
marketing executive : i could lose that in a minute .
user interface designer : so this is no this is a very big , you can not misplace it anywhere . so this is a jumbo universal remote control and it is impossible to i m misplace or lose . this i this is one such interface which can be created . and the personal preference would be a spe to incorporate speech recognisers which will respond to user is voice for a particular function .
project manager : right .
user interface designer : that is
project manager : very much . any comments on her presentation ?
marketing executive : looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there .
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : what i am no suggestion is bad .
user interface designer : yes .
marketing executive : but we are gonna have to narrow it down a little more . i do not think that we can get the t - shape is good , the child one is good , the too big to misplace , it is just funny . i do not think that is gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter .
project manager : i th
marketing executive : it is it is gonna be a little bit too unwieldy .
project manager : no , the these are her presentations , but as far as the decision making we getting to that after
marketing executive :  . have to come back to that later .
user interface designer : we can .
project manager : but if wanted to know whether anybody had any anything to add to her presentation .
marketing executive : no , her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options .
project manager : right . ho who wants to go next ? ,
industrial designer : maybe .
project manager : and you
industrial designer : participant two . the next one , . it is it was the old one .
project manager : the components design .
industrial designer : components .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : this time i am going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design . , can you go on to the next slide , . i have just brief down few components which we require for the remote control construction . the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , it is like it can be a plastic one , hard plastic , so that it can be strong , even if you just , if you if it falls down , then it does not break . so it should be strong . and there are no harmful materials used in that . and it should be recyclable . and ,

marketing executive : that is interesting .
industrial designer : the product can be de delivered into different cases . usually , the cases and card flat that w we see usually d a normal remote controller .
project manager : and you have more pictures . we have five minutes to the end of the meeting .
industrial designer : maybe d i have just one more slide , . like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we ca not use . and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular re or an advanced chip on the print , also infra it includes the infrared se sender . the for the movie just to j develop samples and so spe sample speaker . an , that is it . it is all for me now ,

industrial designer : but i what i am very much doubtful how far it will work , because a speech recogniser like i it has its own problems , issues .
marketing executive : distance problem ?
industrial designer : it is not distance problem it is recognising a person is voice , like maybe different people will be having different voices , so it like it is everything so i
project manager : you teach you have to teach
industrial designer : so to get a good recogni recognising system , it is a costly thing , .
user interface designer : no , it is like your recording of all a question already , and then you are expecting an answer from th , you have a t_v _ system , i am the user and my family members are the user , i will already record a question like , good morning ,
industrial designer : but
user interface designer : like around eight o'clock i want to see the news in the television . so i will say just good morning and the t_v _ will switch on . it will recognise my voice and will switch on .
project manager : before we get too far off here , the components of the concept is the energy . what energy do we foresee ?
marketing executive : battery ,
user interface designer : battery .
marketing executive : and we all on that . that that is gonna be most cost - effective and the best thing .
project manager : then chip on print . and we all agree on the case , we wanna have something maybe bright , colourful .
marketing executive : bright , colourful , trendy design , and strong .
user interface designer : and compact .
industrial designer : and also strong .
user interface designer : trendy design and compact .
industrial designer : trendy , .
project manager : trendy design , compact and strong . user interface concept , interface type , supplements that will be your area , right , jana .
industrial designer : like the switches , like we use buttons for user interface .
project manager : put k i for
industrial designer : push - buttons .
project manager : and not what they mean by supplements .
user interface designer : and supplements like different types of features buttons , like can have a f mute button or a swapping button .
marketing executive : that ,
project manager : like
marketing executive : or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement .
project manager : a what ?
marketing executive : her speech recognition feature would be a supplement .
project manager : right , right ,  .
user interface designer : recogniser .
marketing executive : so why do not we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is .
project manager : . our next meeting will be in thirty minutes , and the i_d _ is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , and the u_i_d _ is supposed to come up with the user interface design , and the marketing expert with the product evaluation . in this phase , the two of you , jana and francine , have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay , it says here . you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches . if you have any questions , you can always contact me or your coach , i suppose .
marketing executive : wherever they are hiding ?

17,"project manager : hello everyone .
industrial designer : hi .
user interface designer : hi .
marketing executive : hi .
project manager : how we doing ?
industrial designer : good .
project manager : first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering i suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it is also an item that people lose a lot . so we should address that . and , it should be something s that is very simple to use . in addition to that to make it sell , the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive , or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that is a very important fact , if they say , i go home and think about it , that wo not work . also mentioned was it should be it should have a very short learning curve . and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan . our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip that has infra - red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip . therefore , messages will be controlled in the same manner . there should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep . if too many buttons are pressed , child lock and maybe a display clock so that people could you could see the time , what show they want to watch . also mentioned was maybe different shapes . so the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra - red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and maybe some a holder for the item . francino who is our
user interface designer : interface designer .
project manager : interface designer has mentioned that the that it , should have an on - off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock . particularly with maybe small children that they could not watch a channel that is undesirable . it should be compact . her personal favourite was it should be t - shaped . and maybe have an anar alarm - clock . and the material should possibly be not of non - allergic nature . the different systems that exist are infra - red or radio - waves . maybe it should have electri electrici electricity saving feature . and even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite program on th right from the remote .
user interface designer : yes .
project manager : are we all in agreement that is about what we discussed last time ?
marketing executive : that is it .
project manager : then we i am looking for three presentations . and i whether the order matters much , i do not , so whoever w wants
user interface designer : start first .
project manager : .
user interface designer : now my slide , .
project manager : your slides . , come on , close already . and that is number two , right ?
user interface designer : three .
project manager : three .
user interface designer : participant three . now as an interface designer , i would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers . now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television . this messages could be switch on - off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel , like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine .
project manager : nine what ? nine channel switches ?
user interface designer : pardon me ?
project manager : nine channel switches ?
user interface designer : yes , nine numbers . and then you have swapping of button
project manager :  .
user interface designer : by which using which you can swap the channels if you do not want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa . then it should have a next button , and next button channel by which you can keep on v scrolling the channels one by one .
industrial designer : going to the nex next .
user interface designer : next slide , . then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume . then , there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television . , if you are watching a french program and you would like to have a subtitles in english , then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the subtitles on the screen . then there should d there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture . now there should be a memory switch . there should be a mute button . suddenly if viewer he gets a telephone call , and if he want he does not want to switch off the t_v _ , but he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can while talking he can watch the t_v _ . now the most important feature i would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature . it is an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit . so a remote can be th can be designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , th now the , the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel . so the t_v _ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user is voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities . so this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have . so this is one of the interface which can be created . a very simple interface which has all the t important features . then , next slide . then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons . so sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that . so you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user - friendly . even a kid can use that . so can you go on t to the next slide . , so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser . and this has multi - purpose use , it can be used for t_v _ , it can be used for cable - satellite , it can be used for v_c_r _ , d_v_d_s and audio . and this has in - built voice recogniser . can you go on to the next slide ? , now this is an interface for a chil for a remote which a child can use . this is user - friendly , it is very attractive and children can use it as they can play with it . and this comes with different colours , different shapes . and this child interface has minimum buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small , compact , attractive child interface . now this is a big over - sized remote which can not be misplaced or it is impossible to misplace .
marketing executive : you me .
user interface designer : this .
marketing executive : i could lose that in a minute .
user interface designer : so this is no this is a very big , you can not misplace it anywhere . so this is a jumbo universal remote control and it is impossible to i m misplace or lose . this i this is one such interface which can be created . and the personal preference would be a spe to incorporate speech recognisers which will respond to user is voice for a particular function .
project manager : right .
user interface designer : that is
project manager : very much . any comments on her presentation ?
marketing executive : looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there .
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : what i am no suggestion is bad .
user interface designer : yes .
marketing executive : but we are gonna have to narrow it down a little more . i do not think that we can get the t - shape is good , the child one is good , the too big to misplace , it is just funny . i do not think that is gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter .
project manager : i th
marketing executive : it is it is gonna be a little bit too unwieldy .
project manager : no , the these are her presentations , but as far as the decision making we getting to that after
marketing executive :  . have to come back to that later .
user interface designer : we can .
project manager : but if wanted to know whether anybody had any anything to add to her presentation .
marketing executive : no , her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options .
project manager : right . ho who wants to go next ? ,
industrial designer : maybe .
project manager : and you
industrial designer : participant two . the next one , . it is it was the old one .
project manager : the components design .
industrial designer : components .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : this time i am going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design . , can you go on to the next slide , . i have just brief down few components which we require for the remote control construction . the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , it is like it can be a plastic one , hard plastic , so that it can be strong , even if you just , if you if it falls down , then it does not break . so it should be strong . and there are no harmful materials used in that . and it should be recyclable . and ,
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : and also using of colouring compon components like if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so we have to use some colouring compone components . and the second important thing is integrated circuit . which we can use a highly sophisticated one because it is like the heart of the remote controller . if it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be like the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one . and it should be resistant to high as low temperatures . suppose if it is thirty - eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should be able to re resist the temperature highs and high temperatures and low temperatures . and it should be with equipped with timer and alarm facility . and the other component we should we have in the remote controller is a resistor which is like i it is very much important for the electricity flow through the remote controller and also a capacitor which is a b which is a m it is like a battery , capacitor . can you go on to the next slide , ? a diode , a transistor , a resonator , these are all this technical electri electronic compons components which are which we have to use in a remote controller . a battery , i would like to suggest one thing if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , even if it is a low performance battery it ca it ca not l it ca not charge much . it it is not a high voltage battery . then also we can if it is a rechargeable one , then people can use it for a long time , so in that way we can cut the cost , but w that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one . and we have a circuit board in a remote controller . can you go to the next slide , . and how it works , how the remote controller works .
project manager : go away .
industrial designer : when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection that means when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , and then the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the chip will know that the number one button was pressed . it pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button . every button , every individual button , has its own morse code . suppose the user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the l_e_d _ which translates the signal into infrared light . like you have got a signal by pressing a button . that is a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit . now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor . that is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller . it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the l_e_d _ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . the sensor on the t_v _ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will know which what action it has to do . then it will do the appropriate action . so this is how the remote controller works .
user interface designer : it works .
industrial designer : i have few pictures . when you look at the remote controller it is it this is a normal remote controller . and to the next slide , . and where we had a few buttons and all . and if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins , and also a capac a capacitor , three resistors and also a resonator and di and a diode transistor . the electronic components all of the electronic components have all those things like a chip and d diode transistors an , di can y you can see the t_a _ double one eight three five labelled chip .
marketing executive : yes .
industrial designer : you can also see the green two green things are these are they are resistors , and just beside that you can see a transistor , and a cylinder shape , that one is a capacitor . and also there are resistors , ther there is a diode . can you go on to the next slide . so this is the circuit board . the green one is a circuit board . actually , building a circuit bo board is pretty easy and also it is a l inexpensive . it is it costs less than what you print on a paper , because when you are building some circuits and also wires , it is better to go for printing , because you can build these k circuit boards on a bulk and it is just printing , nothing like , you do not need to use wires and all . it is not exactly wires we are using . it is just printing something on a board . tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci circuits . so th that green thing is a circuit board , and also you can see there are b s like access for buttons , like when you press a button , the circuit under the button will be activated th it will he get some signals from it and it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the , integrated circuit .
user interface designer : transmit .
industrial designer : so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons . can you see the black , round marks ? they they are the circuits . and like we have designed before we have seen some few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls . b but a b a push - button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and k full a complete chip . and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious hard dynamo , a kinetic provision of energy , more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . so that also we can have in a battery , or we can use solar sells .
marketing executive : that is interesting .
industrial designer : the product can be de delivered into different cases . usually , the cases and card flat that w we see usually d a normal remote controller .
project manager : and you have more pictures . we have five minutes to the end of the meeting .
industrial designer : maybe d i have just one more slide , . like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we ca not use . and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular re or an advanced chip on the print , also infra it includes the infrared se sender . the for the movie just to j develop samples and so spe sample speaker . an , that is it . it is all for me now ,
project manager : any particular comments by anybody ?
marketing executive : on the scroll and the push - button , ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ?
industrial designer : no , no , th the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , which we used to do before ten years before , . now , nobody uses that because you need a k sophisticated chip and all . so it is better we go for ordinary buttons .
marketing executive : we will just go for push buttons
industrial designer : push - buttons .
user interface designer : push - buttons .
marketing executive : for in the interest of cost .
project manager : we do not have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision , and the marketing expert has to present her thing .
marketing executive : go right to my first my next slide . alright , my method is i am interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so i have really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . i s i spend a lot of time on the internet surfing around doing the same thing . and then when i am out in people is houses or at meetings or anything like that , i try to notice what remote controls people have , and if it is convenient in the conversation i ask about it . and i would encourage you all to do the same . and my findings from this is that , small is beautiful . people like something that really fits in their hand . simple is beautiful . they do not want to have to squint at small print , they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want as few buttons as possible , and they do not care for the mode thing . they want each button to do something . and eye - catching is important . it is got ta look cute , it is got ta look appealing . go ahead , i am trying to finish fast for you . and our preference is , as far as i am concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others , so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their christmas item . and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . if we try to tell people it has too many great features , the consumer just gets confused and we do not get anywhere . so we have got ta narrow our selection down to li two things , that we gonna say are really great about our new product . and i have been looking around at what designs every year different things are popular . and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . they are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them . so those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item .
project manager : that concludes the presentation of everyone . and what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote . and so what do we think on the concept of the remote ?
marketing executive : you wanna try to come back to yours , and limit yours a bit ?
project manager : y
user interface designer : yes , i would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser .
marketing executive : so speech recognition is most important as far as you are concerned ?
user interface designer : this could be one feature which could be sellable .
industrial designer : but w
marketing executive : h that could be our star feature .
project manager : that is
marketing executive : that that be really good , i agree with that .
industrial designer : but i what i am very much doubtful how far it will work , because a speech recogniser like i it has its own problems , issues .
marketing executive : distance problem ?
industrial designer : it is not distance problem it is recognising a person is voice , like maybe different people will be having different voices , so it like it is everything so i
project manager : you teach you have to teach
industrial designer : so to get a good recogni recognising system , it is a costly thing , .
user interface designer : no , it is like your recording of all a question already , and then you are expecting an answer from th , you have a t_v _ system , i am the user and my family members are the user , i will already record a question like , good morning ,
industrial designer : but
user interface designer : like around eight o'clock i want to see the news in the television . so i will say just good morning and the t_v _ will switch on . it will recognise my voice and will switch on .
project manager : before we get too far off here , the components of the concept is the energy . what energy do we foresee ?
marketing executive : battery ,
user interface designer : battery .
marketing executive : and we all on that . that that is gonna be most cost - effective and the best thing .
project manager : then chip on print . and we all agree on the case , we wanna have something maybe bright , colourful .
marketing executive : bright , colourful , trendy design , and strong .
user interface designer : and compact .
industrial designer : and also strong .
user interface designer : trendy design and compact .
industrial designer : trendy , .
project manager : trendy design , compact and strong . user interface concept , interface type , supplements that will be your area , right , jana .
industrial designer : like the switches , like we use buttons for user interface .

marketing executive : or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement .
project manager : a what ?
marketing executive : her speech recognition feature would be a supplement .
project manager : right , right ,  .
user interface designer : recogniser .
marketing executive : so why do not we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is .
project manager : . our next meeting will be in thirty minutes , and the i_d _ is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , and the u_i_d _ is supposed to come up with the user interface design , and the marketing expert with the product evaluation . in this phase , the two of you , jana and francine , have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay , it says here . you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches . if you have any questions , you can always contact me or your coach , i suppose .
marketing executive : wherever they are hiding ?
project manager : so we conclude the meeting here and we come back in thirty minutes , according to our timetable here .","the project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting . the interface specialist begins her presentation by highlighting important remote functions and showing examples of remote interfaces . the group comments on her presentation , and then the industrial designer begins presenting . she talks about the technical electronic components of the remote , explains how a remote works , and shows a few pictures revealing the insides of a normal remote control . she suggests giving the remote a strong shell so it is durable , using a rechargable battery , and not adding a scroll wheel because it requires a sophisticated chip . the marketing expert presents , talking about user preferences for a small , simple , eye-catching , cute , appealing , and functional remote . fruit and vegetable shapes are popular this year , so a soft , spongy remote perhaps covered with cloth could make the item marketable . the group discusses the issues surrounding speech recognition , noting that if it is good quality it could be costly . they about the power source and review the objectives of the product . the project manager closes the meeting by telling each member what task she is to complete . the marketing expert will do the product evaluation . the industrial designer and interface specialist will work together on a prototype using modeling clay . the industrial designer will come up with a user interface design . their coaches will send specific instructions and answer questions . they decided that the product should be bright , colorful , trendy in design , strong , compact , have push buttons , and contain supplement features (possibly mute button , swapping button , voice recognition). the power source will be batteries because it is cost-effective . they will have the industrial engineer do more research on the cost of voice recognition before deciding whether to include that function . the group would like to include voice recognition as a feature , but they are not sure about how much it would cost . this will require further research by the industrial engineer .
","the project manager reviewed the minutes of the previous meeting . the user interface designer discussed the interface of a remote with the group . she suggested that the remote should have an on-off button , a channel lock , an anar alarm , and be shaped like a t-shirt . it should also have an electri-electrici feature , as well as a timer so that users can program their favorite programs from the remote . there should also be nine channel switches , swapping buttons by pressing one",X,,,,,,,,6.0,T5-Baseline
18,"project manager : hi everyone again .
user interface designer : hello .
industrial designer : hello .
marketing executive : hello
project manager : like before we i have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting
marketing executive :  .
project manager : and so here we go . it was discussed in the last meeting which was opened by the presentation from the interface designer that looks would be very important on this new remote
user interface designer : designer .
project manager : and it is to send messages to the t_v _ . it should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . it should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings . speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal features she would like see d to be integrated in this new remote . should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . she presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose .
marketing executive : and she was challenged on that point
user interface designer : yes .
project manager : but her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . the industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue . she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . should have an integrated circuit board that is highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . and a circuit board . and how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse code related relays the to the generat to the generator amplification and the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature to consider . she would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . should be battery operated and she would have the special cases . the marketing expert who has to finally come up with to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . from her point of view one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . to do that maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really driven home . it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . she feels that is really what people want today . and the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting . now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype .
user interface designer : just the look like , the button part i will explain .
industrial designer : so this is our what we have made . this is a model of the remote control which we are going to build .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : this is us in a snail shape so it is attractive and it is blue in colour bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is a looks - wise it is beautiful . and also compact in shape . and also i it will be easily fit into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer :
marketing executive : you used to have all the buttons
industrial designer : and the material which we are going to use for the case is plastic and w which is s strong and also for the material is plastic and for the buttons it is s soft rubber and als
marketing executive : that is good , no , that is and friendly .
industrial designer : because you will be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it .
marketing executive :  .
project manager :  ,  .
industrial designer : and then for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it is a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared . and and the button is part will be explained by f francina .
user interface designer : now the we decided upon including certain features on our remote . now these features includes the s signal emitting signal it is the led or l_e_d _ the infrared .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : now we have included the switch on and off button . now we have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model . then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes the different channels . we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . now our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button .
project manager : what button ?
user interface designer : menu button .
project manager : menu ? menu th menu , one .
user interface designer : yes , menu
marketing executive : menu button .
user interface designer : at the centre we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness
marketing executive : of the screen .
user interface designer : of this picture . we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . now this is a special , special feature which we have included . now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . it will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button .
marketing executive : the next channel in the numeric pattern , or
user interface designer : no , swapping is if example you are watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : and at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user is voice and then it will act accordingly . so this is our proposed model . now the marketing expert has to
industrial designer : tell , .
user interface designer : give her suggestion whether it will be sellable or it will be cost effective .
marketing executive : what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb ,
user interface designer : yes , yes .
marketing executive : that you can really hold it in one h you do not need two hands
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : and it is easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , ?
project manager : yes the buttons are all raised , right ?
marketing executive : the buttons are all raised
project manager : are raised ,  .
marketing executive : and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you do not have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down ,
project manager : right . or have two hands to operate it , .
marketing executive : i really like that . you really did a good job on that , my little designers . and i like the idea that the on - off button is in a really prominent place . that is that is a really good thing .
project manager : yes , and it sticks up so that you really
marketing executive : that is great .
project manager : you do not have to g first go like here it is on and ,  .
user interface designer : abs .
marketing executive : the colour is very attractive . the these buttons around here are the mute
user interface designer : no , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons .
marketing executive : these  on both sides they are mute ? so you can push either one ?
project manager : so if you are left - handed or right - handed it does not matter .
marketing executive : and this brings the menu up on the screen ?
user interface designer : pardon me ? this is the menu yes , yes .
marketing executive : this brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are
user interface designer : a the these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , and these two are to scroll the programme channels .
marketing executive : f f .
user interface designer : scroll up or scroll down the channels .
marketing executive : right , very good . it looks like something sell . and now i am supposed to
project manager : i have one question will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ?
user interface designer : yes , it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols .
industrial designer : definitely .
project manager : will have symbols so that the user really knows and does not have to first learn it
user interface designer : yes , which can be easily recognised .
marketing executive : good point because we need the symbols we are going into an international market we ca not have anything that is language dependent .
industrial designer : and also
project manager : but anyway it would ha i it has to have some symbols , text so that people kn
industrial designer : we can text .
marketing executive : symbols on it .
industrial designer : text that we can have on the case itself , it will be printed on the case and symbols as the buttons .
project manager : just wanted make of that  .
user interface designer : and and one more feature is we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : a shell shape .
marketing executive : for the snail ,  ,
project manager : right ,  .
industrial designer : so it is
marketing executive : we have the snail shell .
user interface designer : yes , snail shell .
marketing executive : he goes right back into his shell .
industrial designer : shell .
marketing executive : we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail like that
user interface designer :  . y yes
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : that would , that would really work .
project manager : now what , what are our special features for the marketing ?
marketing executive : so
project manager : that is really the voice recognition that is really unusual
marketing executive : voice recognition is our big selling point nobody else seems to have that in this price range .
project manager : and then , and then the other thing would be sh shape or practicality of use .
marketing executive : that everybody is gonna say their remote control is practical . we have to , we have to dwell on the appearance .
project manager : colours .
marketing executive : we are really gonna have the be the
project manager : cutest .
marketing executive : cutest remote control on the block . so we have to play with the image , play with the snail image play with the visual and then the voice recognition . those are the two things to push . the look and the voice recognition . they are gonna be our two selling points .
project manager : now having said that
marketing executive : i am supposed to make a little presentation , are not i ?
project manager : no , now this was our evaluation criteria which we just have done . now we are gonna talk about financing .
marketing executive : but in my instructions it said i was supposed to go to the board and do something .
project manager : there is a production evaluation .
marketing executive : no ?
project manager : is that you ?
marketing executive : that is me .
project manager : but that is after the financing .
marketing executive : .
project manager : we had looks and voice recognition . now on the financing we bring up the there it is . energy source we say that is battery , right ? so we i we use one . t cell or chart you are trying to change is protected . she told me i could just ch change it here and then it would it does not work .
marketing executive : can you just fill it in the yellow boxes ? or
project manager : , let is see . kinetic source so that is in the energy source that is all we need . electronics , simple chip on print ? is that is what we are using ? regular chip on print . that is all we need , the one
industrial designer : no .
project manager : case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved .
industrial designer : this is a
user interface designer : single curve ?
marketing executive : i it is double curved .
project manager : double curved ? case materi s supplements . plastic we said , right ?
user interface designer : plastic .
project manager : wood , rubber ?
marketing executive : rubber , because we are gonna have the soft buttons .
project manager : but , yes but
industrial designer : that is f for rubbers that is case material .
project manager : that is just for the case material ,
user interface designer : is this for the case ?
project manager : so special colours though , we having that ,
marketing executive : the  , mm ' .
project manager : and then we have to interface push buttons . scroll wheel , no . integrated scroll wheel , l_c _ display ?
user interface designer : no .
marketing executive : no ,
project manager : button .
marketing executive : we did not put the clock in it after all , right ?
project manager : no . , button supplement special colour ?
user interface designer : speci yes
project manager : special form ?
user interface designer : yes d we do have special form .
marketing executive : yes .
project manager : and special material , rubber , wood , yes . total seven point six whatever that means .
industrial designer : that is the price .
project manager : that is the price .
user interface designer : one two three four five six seven eight nine
project manager : ?
industrial designer : maybe it is it just n
project manager : eight , eight point two . that is
user interface designer : nine points , yes .
project manager : eight point two , right ? so , we looks like we are within budget . i should save this i suppose , ?
user interface designer : on the desktop .
project manager : tried that . my documents , computer .
industrial designer : ami .
project manager : my compu here it is , yes .
industrial designer : ami should for
project manager : fine . good , so that is the good news . we gonna be popular . so that financing was pretty simple . now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation .
marketing executive : i will take my file down so you can bring it up . should be able to get it now . , why do not you move just to the next slide right away .
project manager : you wanna go to the next slide ?
marketing executive : right away . , my method for s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? and we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio - economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we have not thought of . we ca not accept every suggestion , but maybe we just need to get a few . and show the prototype to consumer research groups , we do not s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and some child will swallow it and then we wo not sell any . so we have to get some input from those people . and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and we like it , we think it is good , we are gonna get behind it and sell it . , now the things that i was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . i wanted the shape to be biomorphic , i did not want anything with angles and all square , i wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we have got that . the size is small , the colour is bright and warm which is what we wanted . we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we will have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped , even though it is gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that is . and functionality i put last on my list because people are not going to use it before they buy it . so paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel and the shape , that is what people are gonna get in the store .
user interface designer : fee selling .
marketing executive : they do not have a television in the store , they ca not play with it . so they will be our main selling points . th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide . , so the shape is a one . that is really , really excellent shape . the size is small and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these are not i in how i feel . that it is plenty small enough to sell but we are right the scale is one to seven . we are right in the middle as far as c other competitors . and our colour is great . the colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . and given the constraints that we had we got it as soft as possible . and then functionality you did a really good job on functionality , we could have ad added different functions but then we would disturb something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on functionality . so that we have got a great product and we can get off and running with it .
project manager : realised one thing . in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . and i how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too .
marketing executive : we had what , eight euros twenty as our cost ?
project manager : eight , eight twenty , yes .
industrial designer : eight twenty so
marketing executive : and so we have got we have still got four euros to go to spend .
industrial designer : we have four euros ,
project manager : maximum we have another four point three euros four thirty .
marketing executive : that is
project manager : but we have no way of presenting that to management as a f finished , as a finished product and saying with the voice recogniser that costs so much . so we just have to beware of that . and know whether the four thirty will really cover that .
marketing executive : as we know in today is technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the problem is quality . so we are just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us .
user interface designer : yes , yes .
marketing executive : and it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway .
industrial designer : still .
marketing executive : as we have seen with so many of these kinds of products .
project manager : i am to interrupt then but recog remembered that there was no that was not included that there was no room for any special features , ?
industrial designer : included , .
project manager : so to beware of that . you wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ?
marketing executive : i is not this my last slide ?
project manager : yes it is .
marketing executive : go ahead . that was my last slide , . and i am supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . and we are supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there . i am i have forgot to do that , .
project manager : why ? wh why you need that up ?
marketing executive : ? because i ca not remember what i put on there . now i am supposed to see how long my leash is here .
project manager : you can make it there .
marketing executive : you ready . so now we are all supposed to say what we think . so on shape i gave it a one . what would you ra one being good and seven being the worst .
user interface designer : worse , .
marketing executive : what do you think the shape is ?
user interface designer : one .
marketing executive : one , and be betsy ?
project manager : yes shape is one .
industrial designer : even my , shape is one .
marketing executive : one , . and how about on size ? on size
project manager : you you gave it a four .
marketing executive : i gave it a four , i feel it is just average .
project manager : . i would give it at least a two .
industrial designer : even it is one . it is quite small .
marketing executive : you are the designer , you wanna give it a one . and then how about how we doing on colour ?
project manager : colour i
marketing executive : colour , i gave it a one .
project manager : one .
marketing executive : i really like all those bright , warm colours .
project manager : i like the colours .
marketing executive : one .
industrial designer : one .
marketing executive : one , one , . and how about the feel ? taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand .
project manager : i would give it a two .
marketing executive : i gave it a three , two ,
user interface designer : i will give three .
marketing executive : three .
industrial designer : maybe two ,
marketing executive : two , . and the next is functionality where i admit i was a little hard on our team here , but
project manager : it is also you ca not really try it out the other things you have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but i will give it a three .
user interface designer : two .
industrial designer : three ,  .
marketing executive : three ? it looks like we have got ourselves a pretty good product . the functionality is the only place where maybe we have to think about m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . but otherwise we are ready to go with this product . anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ?
project manager : here is what we looking at satisfaction on room for creativity . is there more room for creativity or are we happy ?
user interface designer : we can always improve , yes .
industrial designer : maybe we can , include some more buttons and
user interface designer : yes , features .
industrial designer : features . we can make the buttons few buttons smaller . they are quite big , so we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . if we want to have more features than that .
marketing executive : then again if we are gonna do the speech recognition thing we are gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the speech .
user interface designer : voices .
marketing executive : so that is where we are gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons .
industrial designer : definitely , two mu mute buttons .
marketing executive : and then maybe we can do something with the volume control . maybe we can put that all on one button . and a couple of other th maybe comp consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that .
project manager : y al always bearing in mind that right now we are within the budget
user interface designer : and maybe
project manager : and that we still we probably ca not , with this particular item , we probably ca not just add a whole lot of more things .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : we need to leave space money - wise for the voice recogniser . so th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? , are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we are not happy with the new product we created or that was created ? personally i am pretty happy .
marketing executive : i am pretty happy with it too ,
project manager : an
industrial designer : even i am happy .
marketing executive : it is something market .
project manager : and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ?
marketing executive : you have done a good job , miss leader .
user interface designer : yes , yes you have done a good job .
industrial designer : definitely .
project manager : and team work was very good , we really
marketing executive : i d i do too we worked together as a team , .
project manager : and we are we happy with the means we used ? we used whiteboard , we did not use digital p digital pens i are these things .
marketing executive : maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more ,
user interface designer : whiteboard more , yes .
industrial designer : probably .
marketing executive : we did not use that enough .
project manager : yes , we could . , it is maybe not in the best position in the room like sometimes it is positioned so that it is much better visible for everybody and from that point of view we ignored it a little bit .
marketing executive : and we used the slide because it was better positioned .
project manager : yes , so ,
marketing executive : that is true  .
project manager : and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier . did we new did we find new ideas ?
industrial designer : many .
marketing executive : we were very good , .
project manager : we did , in more than one respect and so we did very here . are the costs within budget ? is the project evaluated ?
marketing executive : yes , yes .
project manager : then celebration .
marketing executive : celebration .
user interface designer : cel celebration yes , yes .
marketing executive : today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne .
project manager : so i all very much . , this was very good and we did come up with a new product that is feasible . feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view .
industrial designer : very much .
marketing executive : watch i have my cord behind you here .
project manager : i always get it on here , but getting it off is
industrial designer : do we do we have some time left ? you have
user interface designer : they say it is forty minutes .
project manager : yes we have time later
marketing executive : but we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished .
project manager : but we do not
industrial designer : alright .
marketing executive : it will take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace . , there we go .","the project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting , detailing the main points of each person's presentation . they do the prototype presentation which includes a model of the remote control . the group discusses this proposed model , approving of the small size and look of it . they goes over finances and are pleased to find that they are well within budget . however , while the marketing expert is doing the product evaulation the group realizes that they neglected to calculate voice recognition into the financing . their cost had been 8.20 euros and they have  4.30 left to cover it , so they decide to settle for whatever quality it will buy . they rate their product on its shape , size , color , feel , and functionality . they discuss the project process , talk briefly about adding more features , and one member suggests eliminating a mute buttons and include a diffferent feature . they are happy with the creativity , leadership , and teamwork within the group , and close the meeting by thanking one another . the remote is a snail shape with bright colors , blue and yellow with multi-colored buttons . compact in size . it includes a remote holder in the shape of a shell . the case will be made of plastic and the buttons of soft rubber . its features will include an on/off button , two mute buttons , nine channel buttons , two buttons for increasing/decreasing the volume , two buttons for scrolling up/down channels , a menu button in the center which controls the color/sharpness/brightness of the picture , and a swapping button . channel buttons numbered , rest of the buttons have symbols indicating function . light emitting diode is flourescent green . in their cost evaluation they got 8.20 , not factoring in the voice recognition feature . they decide to settle for the level of quality the remaining 4.30 euros will get them . the group spent 8.20 euros on their product , but they almost forgot to factor in voice recognition , which may cost more than the 4.30 euros remaining . they will have to settle for whatever level of quality that 4.30 euros can buy .","the project manager opened the meeting and went over the decisions made in the previous meeting . the interface designer presented the prototype the team is working on and displayed all of the buttons . she suggested that a speech recogniser should be included as a feature . she also suggested that the case should be made of plastic and not rubber . the marketing expert presented consumer preferences and requirements . she stressed that the remote should be eye-catching , be technologically innovative , be easy to use , and be spongy . the industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the team discussed options for energy sources , chips , case shapes and colors , and buttons . the team then discussed and decided what components to include and the materials to use . the user interface designer will work on the interface design . the industial designer will build the look and feel of the device . the remote will be powered by a rechargeable battery . will have nine channel buttons , volume buttons , mute buttons , switch to control audio and video , a menu button for teletext , a battery indicator , and a power button . will use a simple chip . will be on a chip . not using a sample speaker with a locator function . speech recognition is one of her very favorite personal features to include in the remote . the case will be made from plastic and will not include a rubber ball . the buttons will be yellow , and the company logo will be displayed on the back of the case . one of the energy sources will be",X,,,,,X,,,7.0,BART-Baseline
19,"project manager : hi everyone again .
user interface designer : hello .
industrial designer : hello .
marketing executive : hello
project manager : like before we i have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting
marketing executive :  .
project manager : and so here we go . it was discussed in the last meeting which was opened by the presentation from the interface designer that looks would be very important on this new remote
user interface designer : designer .
project manager : and it is to send messages to the t_v _ . it should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . it should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings . speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal features she would like see d to be integrated in this new remote . should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . she presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose .
marketing executive : and she was challenged on that point
user interface designer : yes .
project manager : but her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . the industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue . she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . should have an integrated circuit board that is highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . and a circuit board . and how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse code related relays the to the generat to the generator amplification and the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature to consider . she would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . should be battery operated and she would have the special cases . the marketing expert who has to finally come up with to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . from her point of view one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . to do that maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really driven home . it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . she feels that is really what people want today . and the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting . now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype .
user interface designer : just the look like , the button part i will explain .
industrial designer : so this is our what we have made . this is a model of the remote control which we are going to build .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : this is us in a snail shape so it is attractive and it is blue in colour bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is a looks - wise it is beautiful . and also compact in shape . and also i it will be easily fit into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer :
marketing executive : you used to have all the buttons
industrial designer : and the material which we are going to use for the case is plastic and w which is s strong and also for the material is plastic and for the buttons it is s soft rubber and als
marketing executive : that is good , no , that is and friendly .
industrial designer : because you will be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it .
marketing executive :  .
project manager :  ,  .
industrial designer : and then for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it is a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared . and and the button is part will be explained by f francina .
user interface designer : now the we decided upon including certain features on our remote . now these features includes the s signal emitting signal it is the led or l_e_d _ the infrared .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : now we have included the switch on and off button . now we have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model . then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes the different channels . we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . now our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button .
project manager : what button ?
user interface designer : menu button .
project manager : menu ? menu th menu , one .
user interface designer : yes , menu
marketing executive : menu button .
user interface designer : at the centre we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness
marketing executive : of the screen .
user interface designer : of this picture . we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . now this is a special , special feature which we have included . now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . it will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button .
marketing executive : the next channel in the numeric pattern , or
user interface designer : no , swapping is if example you are watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : and at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user is voice and then it will act accordingly . so this is our proposed model . now the marketing expert has to
industrial designer : tell , .
user interface designer : give her suggestion whether it will be sellable or it will be cost effective .
marketing executive : what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb ,
user interface designer : yes , yes .
marketing executive : that you can really hold it in one h you do not need two hands
industrial designer :  .
marketing executive : and it is easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , ?
project manager : yes the buttons are all raised , right ?
marketing executive : the buttons are all raised
project manager : are raised ,  .
marketing executive : and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you do not have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down ,
project manager : right . or have two hands to operate it , .
marketing executive : i really like that . you really did a good job on that , my little designers . and i like the idea that the on - off button is in a really prominent place . that is that is a really good thing .
project manager : yes , and it sticks up so that you really
marketing executive : that is great .
project manager : you do not have to g first go like here it is on and ,  .
user interface designer : abs .
marketing executive : the colour is very attractive . the these buttons around here are the mute
user interface designer : no , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons .
marketing executive : these  on both sides they are mute ? so you can push either one ?
project manager : so if you are left - handed or right - handed it does not matter .
marketing executive : and this brings the menu up on the screen ?
user interface designer : pardon me ? this is the menu yes , yes .
marketing executive : this brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are
user interface designer : a the these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , and these two are to scroll the programme channels .
marketing executive : f f .
user interface designer : scroll up or scroll down the channels .
marketing executive : right , very good . it looks like something sell . and now i am supposed to
project manager : i have one question will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ?
user interface designer : yes , it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols .
industrial designer : definitely .
project manager : will have symbols so that the user really knows and does not have to first learn it
user interface designer : yes , which can be easily recognised .
marketing executive : good point because we need the symbols we are going into an international market we ca not have anything that is language dependent .
industrial designer : and also
project manager : but anyway it would ha i it has to have some symbols , text so that people kn
industrial designer : we can text .
marketing executive : symbols on it .
industrial designer : text that we can have on the case itself , it will be printed on the case and symbols as the buttons .
project manager : just wanted make of that  .
user interface designer : and and one more feature is we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : a shell shape .
marketing executive : for the snail ,  ,
project manager : right ,  .
industrial designer : so it is
marketing executive : we have the snail shell .
user interface designer : yes , snail shell .
marketing executive : he goes right back into his shell .
industrial designer : shell .
marketing executive : we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail like that
user interface designer :  . y yes
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : that would , that would really work .
project manager : now what , what are our special features for the marketing ?
marketing executive : so
project manager : that is really the voice recognition that is really unusual
marketing executive : voice recognition is our big selling point nobody else seems to have that in this price range .
project manager : and then , and then the other thing would be sh shape or practicality of use .
marketing executive : that everybody is gonna say their remote control is practical . we have to , we have to dwell on the appearance .
project manager : colours .
marketing executive : we are really gonna have the be the
project manager : cutest .
marketing executive : cutest remote control on the block . so we have to play with the image , play with the snail image play with the visual and then the voice recognition . those are the two things to push . the look and the voice recognition . they are gonna be our two selling points .
project manager : now having said that
marketing executive : i am supposed to make a little presentation , are not i ?
project manager : no , now this was our evaluation criteria which we just have done . now we are gonna talk about financing .
marketing executive : but in my instructions it said i was supposed to go to the board and do something .
project manager : there is a production evaluation .
marketing executive : no ?
project manager : is that you ?
marketing executive : that is me .
project manager : but that is after the financing .
marketing executive : .
project manager : we had looks and voice recognition . now on the financing we bring up the there it is . energy source we say that is battery , right ? so we i we use one . t cell or chart you are trying to change is protected . she told me i could just ch change it here and then it would it does not work .
marketing executive : can you just fill it in the yellow boxes ? or
project manager : , let is see . kinetic source so that is in the energy source that is all we need . electronics , simple chip on print ? is that is what we are using ? regular chip on print . that is all we need , the one
industrial designer : no .
project manager : case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved .
industrial designer : this is a
user interface designer : single curve ?
marketing executive : i it is double curved .
project manager : double curved ? case materi s supplements . plastic we said , right ?
user interface designer : plastic .
project manager : wood , rubber ?
marketing executive : rubber , because we are gonna have the soft buttons .
project manager : but , yes but
industrial designer : that is f for rubbers that is case material .
project manager : that is just for the case material ,
user interface designer : is this for the case ?
project manager : so special colours though , we having that ,
marketing executive : the  , mm ' .
project manager : and then we have to interface push buttons . scroll wheel , no . integrated scroll wheel , l_c _ display ?
user interface designer : no .
marketing executive : no ,
project manager : button .
marketing executive : we did not put the clock in it after all , right ?
project manager : no . , button supplement special colour ?
user interface designer : speci yes
project manager : special form ?
user interface designer : yes d we do have special form .
marketing executive : yes .
project manager : and special material , rubber , wood , yes . total seven point six whatever that means .
industrial designer : that is the price .
project manager : that is the price .
user interface designer : one two three four five six seven eight nine
project manager : ?
industrial designer : maybe it is it just n
project manager : eight , eight point two . that is
user interface designer : nine points , yes .
project manager : eight point two , right ? so , we looks like we are within budget . i should save this i suppose , ?
user interface designer : on the desktop .
project manager : tried that . my documents , computer .
industrial designer : ami .
project manager : my compu here it is , yes .
industrial designer : ami should for
project manager : fine . good , so that is the good news . we gonna be popular . so that financing was pretty simple . now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation .
marketing executive : i will take my file down so you can bring it up . should be able to get it now . , why do not you move just to the next slide right away .
project manager : you wanna go to the next slide ?
marketing executive : right away . , my method for s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? and we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio - economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we have not thought of . we ca not accept every suggestion , but maybe we just need to get a few . and show the prototype to consumer research groups , we do not s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and some child will swallow it and then we wo not sell any . so we have to get some input from those people . and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and we like it , we think it is good , we are gonna get behind it and sell it . , now the things that i was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . i wanted the shape to be biomorphic , i did not want anything with angles and all square , i wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we have got that . the size is small , the colour is bright and warm which is what we wanted . we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we will have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped , even though it is gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that is . and functionality i put last on my list because people are not going to use it before they buy it . so paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel and the shape , that is what people are gonna get in the store .
user interface designer : fee selling .
marketing executive : they do not have a television in the store , they ca not play with it . so they will be our main selling points . th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide . , so the shape is a one . that is really , really excellent shape . the size is small and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these are not i in how i feel . that it is plenty small enough to sell but we are right the scale is one to seven . we are right in the middle as far as c other competitors . and our colour is great . the colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . and given the constraints that we had we got it as soft as possible . and then functionality you did a really good job on functionality , we could have ad added different functions but then we would disturb something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on functionality . so that we have got a great product and we can get off and running with it .
project manager : realised one thing . in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . and i how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too .
marketing executive : we had what , eight euros twenty as our cost ?
project manager : eight , eight twenty , yes .
industrial designer : eight twenty so
marketing executive : and so we have got we have still got four euros to go to spend .
industrial designer : we have four euros ,
project manager : maximum we have another four point three euros four thirty .
marketing executive : that is
project manager : but we have no way of presenting that to management as a f finished , as a finished product and saying with the voice recogniser that costs so much . so we just have to beware of that . and know whether the four thirty will really cover that .
marketing executive : as we know in today is technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the problem is quality . so we are just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us .
user interface designer : yes , yes .
marketing executive : and it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway .
industrial designer : still .
marketing executive : as we have seen with so many of these kinds of products .
project manager : i am to interrupt then but recog remembered that there was no that was not included that there was no room for any special features , ?
industrial designer : included , .
project manager : so to beware of that . you wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ?
marketing executive : i is not this my last slide ?
project manager : yes it is .
marketing executive : go ahead . that was my last slide , . and i am supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . and we are supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there . i am i have forgot to do that , .
project manager : why ? wh why you need that up ?
marketing executive : ? because i ca not remember what i put on there . now i am supposed to see how long my leash is here .
project manager : you can make it there .
marketing executive : you ready . so now we are all supposed to say what we think . so on shape i gave it a one . what would you ra one being good and seven being the worst .
user interface designer : worse , .
marketing executive : what do you think the shape is ?
user interface designer : one .
marketing executive : one , and be betsy ?
project manager : yes shape is one .
industrial designer : even my , shape is one .
marketing executive : one , . and how about on size ? on size
project manager : you you gave it a four .
marketing executive : i gave it a four , i feel it is just average .
project manager : . i would give it at least a two .
industrial designer : even it is one . it is quite small .
marketing executive : you are the designer , you wanna give it a one . and then how about how we doing on colour ?
project manager : colour i
marketing executive : colour , i gave it a one .
project manager : one .
marketing executive : i really like all those bright , warm colours .
project manager : i like the colours .
marketing executive : one .
industrial designer : one .
marketing executive : one , one , . and how about the feel ? taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand .
project manager : i would give it a two .
marketing executive : i gave it a three , two ,
user interface designer : i will give three .
marketing executive : three .
industrial designer : maybe two ,
marketing executive : two , . and the next is functionality where i admit i was a little hard on our team here , but
project manager : it is also you ca not really try it out the other things you have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but i will give it a three .
user interface designer : two .
industrial designer : three ,  .
marketing executive : three ? it looks like we have got ourselves a pretty good product . the functionality is the only place where maybe we have to think about m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . but otherwise we are ready to go with this product . anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ?
project manager : here is what we looking at satisfaction on room for creativity . is there more room for creativity or are we happy ?
user interface designer : we can always improve , yes .
industrial designer : maybe we can , include some more buttons and
user interface designer : yes , features .
industrial designer : features . we can make the buttons few buttons smaller . they are quite big , so we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . if we want to have more features than that .
marketing executive : then again if we are gonna do the speech recognition thing we are gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the speech .
user interface designer : voices .
marketing executive : so that is where we are gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons .
industrial designer : definitely , two mu mute buttons .
marketing executive : and then maybe we can do something with the volume control . maybe we can put that all on one button . and a couple of other th maybe comp consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that .
project manager : y al always bearing in mind that right now we are within the budget
user interface designer : and maybe
project manager : and that we still we probably ca not , with this particular item , we probably ca not just add a whole lot of more things .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : we need to leave space money - wise for the voice recogniser . so th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? , are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we are not happy with the new product we created or that was created ? personally i am pretty happy .
marketing executive : i am pretty happy with it too ,
project manager : an
industrial designer : even i am happy .
marketing executive : it is something market .
project manager : and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ?
marketing executive : you have done a good job , miss leader .
user interface designer : yes , yes you have done a good job .
industrial designer : definitely .
project manager : and team work was very good , we really
marketing executive : i d i do too we worked together as a team , .
project manager : and we are we happy with the means we used ? we used whiteboard , we did not use digital p digital pens i are these things .
marketing executive : maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more ,
user interface designer : whiteboard more , yes .
industrial designer : probably .
marketing executive : we did not use that enough .
project manager : yes , we could . , it is maybe not in the best position in the room like sometimes it is positioned so that it is much better visible for everybody and from that point of view we ignored it a little bit .
marketing executive : and we used the slide because it was better positioned .
project manager : yes , so ,
marketing executive : that is true  .
project manager : and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier . did we new did we find new ideas ?
industrial designer : many .
marketing executive : we were very good , .
project manager : we did , in more than one respect and so we did very here . are the costs within budget ? is the project evaluated ?
marketing executive : yes , yes .
project manager : then celebration .
marketing executive : celebration .
user interface designer : cel celebration yes , yes .
marketing executive : today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne .
project manager : so i all very much . , this was very good and we did come up with a new product that is feasible . feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view .
industrial designer : very much .
marketing executive : watch i have my cord behind you here .
project manager : i always get it on here , but getting it off is
industrial designer : do we do we have some time left ? you have
user interface designer : they say it is forty minutes .
project manager : yes we have time later
marketing executive : but we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished .
project manager : but we do not
industrial designer : alright .
marketing executive : it will take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace . , there we go .","the project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting , detailing the main points of each person's presentation . they do the prototype presentation which includes a model of the remote control . the group discusses this proposed model , approving of the small size and look of it . they goes over finances and are pleased to find that they are well within budget . however , while the marketing expert is doing the product evaulation the group realizes that they neglected to calculate voice recognition into the financing . their cost had been 8.20 euros and they have  4.30 left to cover it , so they decide to settle for whatever quality it will buy . they rate their product on its shape , size , color , feel , and functionality . they discuss the project process , talk briefly about adding more features , and one member suggests eliminating a mute buttons and include a diffferent feature . they are happy with the creativity , leadership , and teamwork within the group , and close the meeting by thanking one another . the remote is a snail shape with bright colors , blue and yellow with multi-colored buttons . compact in size . it includes a remote holder in the shape of a shell . the case will be made of plastic and the buttons of soft rubber . its features will include an on/off button , two mute buttons , nine channel buttons , two buttons for increasing/decreasing the volume , two buttons for scrolling up/down channels , a menu button in the center which controls the color/sharpness/brightness of the picture , and a swapping button . channel buttons numbered , rest of the buttons have symbols indicating function . light emitting diode is flourescent green . in their cost evaluation they got 8.20 , not factoring in the voice recognition feature . they decide to settle for the level of quality the remaining 4.30 euros will get them . the group spent 8.20 euros on their product , but they almost forgot to factor in voice recognition , which may cost more than the 4.30 euros remaining . they will have to settle for whatever level of quality that 4.30 euros can buy .","the user interface designer opened the meeting by stating her personal preference for a remote which has a large number of buttons , is easy to use , contains a battery , is not curvy , and is made from plastic rather than rubber . she also stressed the need for a mechanism to locate a misplaced remote . the marketing expert presented some research on the market which indicated that consumers want a remote that is technologically innovative , easy to use , contains a battery , is not yellow , has a locator function , and is ergonomically-designed . the industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the restrictions involved in combining various components , energy sources , and materials . the project manager gave the group new requirements for the product design . the group discussed what components , materials , and energy sources to use , and decided on the shape and color of the remote . the industrial designer will work on the look and feel of the design . the user interface designer will work on the technical functions design . the marketing expert will work on a product evaluation . the group decided on what components , materials , and energy sources to use . the remote will be yellow , and possibly made of plastic rather than rubber . the group decided that the shape and color of the remote should be attractive . the remote will contain a battery . the remote will have a locator function . the group decided that",,,,X,,,,X,6.0,Pegasus-Cons

user interface designer : hello .
industrial designer : hi .
marketing executive : hey , project manager .
user interface designer : project manager , i have something to tell you . i have a little problems with my laptop . and s so i had a little less time to complete . no , a little problem , big problem . thought
marketing executive : what was it , problem ?
user interface designer : it did not work anymore .
marketing executive : the laptop ?
user interface designer : the entire windows
marketing executive : it hang hung .
user interface designer : it it hung .
marketing executive : ha - ha . project manager .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : you are our project manager .
project manager : your project manager . welcome to the conceptual design meeting for real reaction . , hello again . it is the same as the last time . , also this time there will be three presentations . and we must reach a decision on the remote control concepts . , and at the end , i , when i finish it off i have some input from a master class i visited .
user interface designer : during lunch , .
marketing executive : master .
user interface designer : he is the master , .
project manager : the the concepts on we where we must reach a decision on . , our from are of two sorts .
marketing executive : master of
project manager : components concepts and user interface concepts . , the first one is really about the total package with , we have decided to do a do the with a touch - screen that must be a case around it so it wo not be as breakable . how about the energy ? can you can you reload it or just have batteries which you must exchange ? , the user interface concept . , with the type and the supplements . so where to put what button . and i would say jans , can you begin ?
industrial designer : .
project manager : at the end , i will take notes and at the end of the minutes will be at the shared folder .
industrial designer : let me see . it is this one . , i will be talking about the components . , what i did was i reviewed previously used items by two different age groups .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : below forty five and above . and watch what the differences are and i checked , what d do we want , and how can we d aim a at the target group . what i found was that a senior citizens
marketing executive : i am .
industrial designer : ye , it is .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : they , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and such more . wood and chrome . and they like straightforward shapes . , they like luxurious styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more soft materials . think of the teletubbies , . , soft and fluffy and colourful and , shapes are curved and round . y y you get the picture . and they like sports and gaming , and that gives them the vitality . , so w , firs
project manager : one one little question .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : about the material . a soft material for a remote control ?
industrial designer : no , i will get to that .
project manager : .
industrial designer : you you will see . , f first off , let is start with the energy . w i had a choice between a few different sources . but the two basic sources that i found were the best possible were the battery versus kinetic . kinetic , that is when you move something , then it gets energy . i figured , that is ki kinda high - tech , when you have a remote control that , when you pick it up , it has power . that would be actually very , i figured . , we could also use a battery , that is a bit
marketing executive : but when the power gets low , you have to shake it ?
industrial designer : . , you c just you have to shake it around a little bit .
marketing executive : and
industrial designer : and then it d then it has some more energy . , y you could just go for a battery . or you can go for both ?
user interface designer : have you considered the option of using a solar panel ?
industrial designer : i actually did . but about solar panel is you have to have l light . , sunlight preferably .
user interface designer : w nah .
industrial designer : and you could use normal light , but you would not get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery . for ultimate b n use of solar panels , you could actually use you could use solar panels , but you ha you would have to implement them into the remote control , leaving you a bit less space for the interface .
marketing executive : . it is too less space .
industrial designer : so so i it wo what is actually i c just in f i have figured it out that , seeing that you will always be within the l distance of t_v _ , and the from t_v _ there comes a whole bunch of light . so it would actually power itself from a t_v _ . but , you just take up all the space , and you would not have the full amount of power actually used .
project manager : but you prefer kinetic ?
industrial designer : i prefer kinetic because it is , the costs are not that much higher , and , ju just a bit more high - tech than a normal battery .
project manager : but you do not move a remote control too much .
industrial designer : if no , but d , you pick it up and you press buttons and y , you
project manager : and that is enough to keep the energy level
industrial designer : actually it is . and it if it is not , you just shake it a bit and add with power up again . but , what l what jarek said , you could use a battery that you would just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . and for rest , you would just add juice on the battery .
marketing executive : and when the battery does not work , i usually shake it too . so
project manager : tim .
industrial designer : exactly .
marketing executive : like slamming on it . it is exactly the same .
industrial designer : and so that , f furthermore , you we checked the cases . we have different options concerning the cases . you ha i you sim you simply add a basic standard model it was square and i figured that is a bit boring . so you we could go for the single curved or the double curved . , single curve , it is just a , , it is just a curve . or but you could go in a in an double curves . and that is like several different dimensions . that gives you an whole new effec
project manager : dynamic dynamic look ?
industrial designer : that gives you a younger and more high - tech look , i f i figured . but , that we will discuss later .
marketing executive : but , are you going to draw it ?
industrial designer : what ?
user interface designer : th th .
industrial designer : you want me to draw in three - d _ ?
marketing executive : the , i c i ca not imagine .
industrial designer : i ca i could show you .
marketing executive : i ca not imagine how it looks like .
industrial designer : let is say y you let is say that is your standard
marketing executive : design .
industrial designer : that is a bit your d standard design . but you could actually go like something like this .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : and then in three - d _ effect you could go so y you just , this is a this bit difficulty in i did not take a major in art . so but but you could have a whole new the back the depth , you could just play around a bit with .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : you you do not have to use standard
project manager : a little artistic .
industrial designer : you could y it leaves more space for creativity . that might be an idea , but just a , furthermore , plastic versus rubber ? you we could choose what is better , plastic or rubber . i ch prefer rubber because it feels .
project manager : it is soft .
industrial designer : it is soft and it is that i like soft .
project manager : that is the material the younger people want , ai not it ?
industrial designer : plastic is plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , like plastic your your i usually associate plastic with something that is cheap . that is maybe just me , but , we could , talk about it later . furthermore , buttons . traditional or a touch screen . , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so i figured i will just leave it at the l_c_d _ . and chip set , if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go with a simple chip set . but if we decide to go on a n l_c_d _ screen , we would use an we have to use an a advanced chip set . and that would bring the necessary costs with it . so that is something we th have to keep in mind . if it is not manageable budget - wise , we would have to go over to sim to simple buttons .
marketing executive : we are going to sell tell ten millions of them . so i bet a big company in korea or taiwan , like samsung , can give us a big discount on the chips , so
industrial designer : probably .
marketing executive : u usually , chips are are not more expensive than one dollar .
industrial designer : probably , but but , that is
marketing executive : so that that should not be a real issue , .
industrial designer : that should not be that big a issue . i will just add , i put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit . what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ?
user interface designer : you should use kinetic as a back - up .
industrial designer : you should we should
marketing executive : a combination .
user interface designer : a combination , .
industrial designer : a combination . , you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . when you pick it up , it charges up .
marketing executive : like an aku acu , .
industrial designer : i know .
user interface designer : .
project manager : just like the watch from seiko .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : psycho - kinetic .
industrial designer : i con exactly . what what do you think ?
project manager : i would prefer both too .
industrial designer : you agree ?
project manager : .
industrial designer : ?
marketing executive : combine them .
industrial designer : that would bring the m some more costs , but the who cares , right . that is the project manager is problem .
user interface designer : buy a fifty cents battery and
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : fifty cent , why does not and then we have single - curved versus double - curved .
user interface designer : maybe i have something in my presentation to cope with that .
industrial designer : that no , we will just and , plastic versus rubber .
marketing executive : rubber .
project manager : rubber .
industrial designer : rubber ?
user interface designer : is not possible to make combination with rubber is or bendable remotes where you have got a .
industrial designer : you
user interface designer : or do you think it
industrial designer : i figured it will be m rather than hard
user interface designer : rubber casing , .
industrial designer : nah , rubber c this is a casing , . rubber casing ,
marketing executive : rather hard .
industrial designer : because if you use an d a touch - screen , it is just a casing around it . so , you could go for plastic , but i figured
user interface designer : d maybe ask it right now the question that i have .
industrial designer : i would choose rubber .
user interface designer : is it possible of is it necessary to make a touch - screen square ?
industrial designer : m i .
marketing executive : that touch - screens are generally square . but it is the case you put around it that makes the shape .
user interface designer : we are we put fashion in electronics ,
industrial designer : that is not
user interface designer : so maybe we can
marketing executive : ? , but if you have a square l_c_d _ screen , and you put a case around it that has like bulbs or that covers part of the l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer :  .
industrial designer : that would cover it .
marketing executive : that
industrial designer : that that would solve the problem .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : that is it is custom customisable and
industrial designer : so so what are the opinions ? rubber or plastic ? i prefer rubber .
marketing executive : me too .
project manager : me too .
industrial designer : you too ?
user interface designer : that is good .
industrial designer : you ? you you seemed to hesitate a bit .
user interface designer : as long a as long as it is firm , and you do not it is not bendable , i th that goes too far .
industrial designer : it should not flop over when you hold it in your hand no , that that is gonna the the chip set will hold it firm in place , and a l_c_d _ screen also
user interface designer : it might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor .
industrial designer : it m might it might . , tra traditional versus l_c_d _ , i figured we all set on that . and , then also the simple versus advanced . i figure if we go for l _ l_c_d _ , we should have the advanced . so that should not be a problem . , that is my , you are welcome .
marketing executive : can i do my thing ?
project manager : . do your thing , tim .
marketing executive : it
user interface designer : do your thing .
project manager : bring it on .
marketing executive : expert map . last week i went to paris and milan for some trend - watching . for marketing . our research and development department and i went to paris and milan . in paris and milan , we asked different people , differing in age and in income , the amount of money to spend , what they like in design and material nowadays . our main audience , so that is people below forty , prefer the following . at first , the colours of fruit . very basic colours , like janus explained . , fresh colours , green , red , strawberry red , yellow , banana yellow . , considering material , . they like spongy material ,
user interface designer : spongeball .
marketing executive : like a sponge - ball . like a s soft material . janus m mentioned it also . he did some findings himself .
industrial designer : the teletubbies sh
marketing executive : you wer you were not in paris ? like big g flashy colours .
project manager : flashy .
marketing executive : it is , . , our secondary audience , people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . , materials like wood that
project manager : but wood is not a material you which you build a remote control of .
industrial designer : you could . you you could .
marketing executive : no n j just a w
project manager : but never seen one .
user interface designer : it will float .
marketing executive : no , but just a wooden look .
project manager : case . , a wooden look , .
marketing executive : like you have those fake panels on the floor .
user interface designer : tables .
marketing executive : the that is not wood anyway , but but , that is our secondary audience . so , we decided to take the people below forty . so , that this does not apply . , there are some overall thoughts about new remote controls . they have to look fancy . , they should be technological in innovative . that means there have to be fancy things in . , and easy to use . but that is common . my personal preferences . we have to aim at a mu at the main audience . and , therefore use fresh colours .
project manager : would you prefer that you can choose the colour of your remote control or
marketing executive : i will come to that in a second point . here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . to customise your own remote control . like the nokia the removable covers , just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one . , a third , material being used could be like rubber . , two advantages . , it fits within the current market trends . and it adds safety to your remote when you drop it . so to come back to your question , and the people in milan and paris also think that the rubber should be pretty hard . like seen on regular mobile phones . actually , they have a lot in common . the phones and the
industrial designer : i actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so .
marketing executive : .
project manager : maybe you could use your remote as a phone .
user interface designer : hey .
industrial designer : hey .
project manager : there are numbers on it , so
industrial designer : that might be a next step .
marketing executive : exactly . , in my second sheet of personal preferences , we have to reconsider the speech function recognition . , it is very innovative .
project manager : so that you say s_p_s_s _ , and it goes to
marketing executive : like something . you you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak speech recognition and . but , we have to keep the cost in mind , but it
user interface designer : twelve fifty
marketing executive : it can be very expensive . , building games like snake or tetris to amuse the younger users . , also the link with mobile phones .
project manager : but you do not use that th games when you watching television , .
marketing executive : no , but no , . but you do not use games when you are d when you are making a telephone call . it is just the same .
user interface designer : when your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else .
project manager : .
marketing executive : when you are at college .
project manager : you take your remote control with you .
user interface designer : take it .
industrial designer : you take your remote with you to school .
marketing executive : no . you al you also take t you take your ipac and go play games . , i do that , but and third , i stick with it , the log - in functionality with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension .
user interface designer : . s
industrial designer : very .
marketing executive : that is it .
project manager : great .
user interface designer : in . the interface contents . that is a just simple powerpoint mock - up i want to m make it more as dynamic for you so i will draw there . but , the main concept is take one big touch screen . , always display the primary buttons clear and visible . maybe even li like this with u uses of a lot of space . and make the menu structure changeable . so if you press system , that is , m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or one , can fit in . or maybe even a step further when you want to t have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . and other buttons can may be displayed here if that is necessary . and , how do we want to look at f does a remote look , it is you have got ta hold it in one hand . so the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands . and some remotes you can use with your thumb . but that is too difficult for this one . so you can make it s a little broader . and maybe use your thumb on the main buttons . and use your other hands on the menu structure . so here are gonna be the program buttons . one , two , three , four , et cetera . and the volume control and program control maybe . and , down here , i added , this could be one big l_c_d _ . , the menu structure . so you can use it in this way . one thing you have got ta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . , know that if you are changing the menu structure here , and , i still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . but if you are programming the colour of the t_v _ , do not display twenty other options that are possible . just keep it as simple as possible . and do not use too many levels . do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un - plus , and push plus twenty times . but just the just in one button if possible . and , you kn you all know the t_v _ levels . , channel one , two . and when you get to n to ten , ye and want to go back , you have a problem . just m most modern t_v_s , you press one zero , and it goes to ten . and else , to one and through after that . so the s a button less . and , things like teletext , put them in the menu . things like
marketing executive : . , what do you think about a back - and - forth come - up button ?
user interface designer : w , i find i must trying to tell it .
marketing executive : l like in internet explorer .
user interface designer : is volume plus and minus ? and this is program plus and minus .
marketing executive : but does it that is for going from four to five .
user interface designer : yes .
marketing executive : but if you go from two to eight , and you want
user interface designer : or if you are watching studio sports on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two
marketing executive : and on two . that you can switch easy .
user interface designer : yes , that is a good idea . but , m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure .
marketing executive : it is .
user interface designer : and if you are using that button a lot of times , the menu will still be displayed on the screen . you just do not have to play games in - between . but if you are really switching between two channels , you wo not have time to d use the other options .
marketing executive : no .
user interface designer : already told that . that is my conclusion .
project manager : we can discuss a little about the three revolutionary things tim came with . the parental control , the games , and the voice recognition . there is n not too much decision on that one so that parental control is a good function to put in the remote . i how you think about it .
user interface designer : i agree , just put it in the menu structure somewhere . , system properties , parental control .
marketing executive : but what i see how i see it is you put it on the remote and then you have like a windows log - on screen with parents , children . something like that .
user interface designer : w , .
marketing executive : and w when you want to use the parents option , you have to
user interface designer : it it has to be fast . you do not want to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and twenty seconds for the log - on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings .
project manager : no but most people find it much more important that their children do not watch sex or violence on the television , and ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can finally watch it because of that .
user interface designer : why you c may use like when there is x_p _ , a simple log - on , d you just push one or two or three .
marketing executive : . pu push parents .
user interface designer : and if you push parents , then
marketing executive : that then you have to go to three - digit log - in .
user interface designer : . and if you puts a ye
marketing executive : like two one three .
user interface designer : and if you w you push p children , you do not have to log in , but you can only watch children is channels or
marketing executive : it automatically goes .
industrial designer : i if it is worth the time and effort we are going to spend on it . because it is a simple function , but it is gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time to programming it . because you will have to start working with the profiles and such . and i am not if it is actually worth investing that much time and effort into it .
project manager : that is a b there is a big market for it ,
industrial designer : i what
project manager : because you , you read many times in magazines same , and you heard on the news that he , they believe that children are influenced by the television ,
marketing executive : v violent t_v _ .
project manager : and , we are aiming to below forty years . but there are a lot of people will below forty who have children in young age who want to not watch violent or
user interface designer : maybe some idea on that . just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , if my grandad would buy this remote , he would not want to bother with all the things to do . just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles .
project manager : that is a that is a better idea ?
marketing executive : w it just has to be w when it is deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain . but if you want to install it personally if i got kids , and i could choose between two remote controls . one w with parent control and one without , and i would buy the one with .
project manager : with and one without .
user interface designer : b , still some question i have about how to incorporate those ones .
marketing executive : i th .
user interface designer : you are thinking about some channels they can not see , but , i when , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock in the evening violent films and movies will come and maybe some timing will be needed instead of channels , because if you are watching , i , you are in the at day , cartoons will come up m on maybe friday night .
project manager : maybe it can work with show view . , you can control your video recorder with show view . , when you tick in a number , it will start and end recording . but maybe there is some option that t the show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out .
user interface designer : the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show - view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all ,
project manager : .
user interface designer : will have to decide
marketing executive : but that is not possible .
user interface designer : that is not possible .
industrial designer : but , if you want to i i if we in incorporate the parental control , let is say we do , and whatever , cho child just goes up to the t_v _ and presses up . , nob nobody is stopping the child from checking the channel .
user interface designer : you could say if parental control is only it will go from fourteen to sixteen with the page - up then , but
industrial designer : but that , i am not because for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the remote control , so it would , have to be constant signalling . what m what may be better is to incorporate an a separate device that you can program with the remote control . and that provides parental control , . and that is just an optional device . so there is n that is there is besides the remote control , you will have a separate
project manager : i would not put it in an optional device . that that then it becomes too much , .
industrial designer : ?
project manager : if we do it , we must do it in a ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise .
user interface designer : on a separate menu option .
marketing executive : and and w when you install another device , children can still go up to the t_v _ , p pop open the thing and g
industrial designer : that is true . that is true ,
marketing executive : go to a channel .
industrial designer : but at same instant , same happens when you have remote control . so
marketing executive : but
industrial designer : but , only difference is the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control , and those people would not necessary want it .
marketing executive : it is
industrial designer : so , you would be
marketing executive : . but it is just an added feature .
project manager : . and what do you guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? i personally think that becomes too much .
user interface designer : i
project manager : it is more like it gets you to the functionality , but
user interface designer : a mail too from management that it is very popular to use voice recon recognition . but i do not think when you are watching t_v _ , hearing loud noises from the t_v _ , someone screaming one , and you f the channel switches , .
marketing executive : like f voice recognition is too much , . but
project manager : and games ?
marketing executive : games . it does not
industrial designer : . see games happening .
user interface designer : w you can put it on chip anyway , so
project manager : that would
user interface designer : as long as it is is not a primary feature of the remote ,
marketing executive : that that does not c that does not co
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : that does not cost a lot of extra resources , .
project manager : so that will that must be in it , you think ?
industrial designer : that will be .
project manager : . so the games are in it . the voice recognition are not . and the parental control are
user interface designer : optional in
project manager : optional ?
marketing executive : it is in it . but too ma so , but
user interface designer : but how we do it ? , also it is a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . so we should make it too complex . is t some menu function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on . but how it is gonna work will f be a problem .
project manager : but will there like the first idea from you can buy it without and with parental contr control ? or are we going to put it in and just
user interface designer : ye best would be to put it in and make it an menu option .
marketing executive : to put
user interface designer : you can put on
marketing executive : to put it in always .
user interface designer : and you can just s when you buy it , you can select personal preference , parental control on , and the password .
industrial designer : i . i figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with a receiver in it . so you could actually easily build in parental control . but it would be more expensive . so , a and that way you could make cheap model and a expensive model . could ma make the simple model and the deluxe model , .
user interface designer : it is a p .
marketing executive : but t_v_s are not capable of sending .
industrial designer : yes they are .
marketing executive : they were just
project manager : you yo
industrial designer : you have some t_v_s any
marketing executive : a able to receive . but
project manager : but most often not .
industrial designer : . that is true , that is true .
user interface designer : maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you can not watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you can not watch all channels after ten o'clock . and there is just some little clock in the remote .
industrial designer : you could easily to the mote control .
marketing executive : j just some rules .
industrial designer : but you still have the problem about the television itself .
user interface designer : no , no , it is very simple . there th i h i have seen some of remotes who have a clock in it . so , the remote does does not transmit when it is after twelve clock .
marketing executive : but , on the t_v _
user interface designer : ?
marketing executive : at least my t_v _ , is a compartment which you can press . and there are buttons behind it which you can use , if you d if you do not have a
user interface designer : that is to put it very blunt , that is not our problem . just have the parents buy some glue and it is not a part of the remote .
industrial designer : that is true .
user interface designer : you have to f .
industrial designer : you could go like
user interface designer : or make it ourselves very diffic
industrial designer : that would actually make things a lot more easy . you could just blame it on television and make it their problem . , i figured i figure we could do that . , i am not what marketing thinks about it , but
marketing executive : or j . i have to consult my legal advisor about it .
project manager : . so we have decided on the things that from janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic . the case will be double - curved and rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour that with cover is removable . the buttons will be touch - screen . but there may not be too many buttons . and in the menu structure , there must not to be five minutes to go . , too many levels . and it must be easy to use . the parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . and the games are in it . so we have decided , .
marketing executive : consensus .
project manager : little more .
marketing executive : . i have one thing left . maybe for jerome .
user interface designer : ? i am listening .
marketing executive : the views . maybe it is handy to build in an expert view and a simple view .
project manager : like a like a moat or s .
user interface designer :
industrial designer : user profile .
marketing executive : like at in the experts view , you have a lot of more buttons .
project manager : but you have that in the
user interface designer : what i was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you do not use it is simple .
project manager : you use the
user interface designer : and when you push system properties , entire list pops up with e ev all f you can program .
project manager : . it is already incorporated a little in that concept .
marketing executive : . fairly enough .
industrial designer : you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users .
marketing executive : wh which buttons you like or not .
industrial designer : which buttons do you want to in it . because you can like build in a back - forward button , and some po somebody would just want to watch two channels .
marketing executive : just leave the other numbers away .
industrial designer : you could m have people want that .
project manager : we take it to the other meeting , i have a little w little chat to do
industrial designer : .
project manager : and then we finish .
marketing executive : a little chat .
project manager : i went to a master class and two things are can come in handy for us . first thing is we talked about knowledge management . knowledge engineering and the fact that the idea of knowledge , sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is like that . it is it is very hot at the moment , so it is mostly for the management expert to look what other
marketing executive : marketing .
project manager : marketing or did i said management ?
marketing executive : management .
project manager : just talking about myself .
marketing executive : that is my function , to
project manager : w what other companies had to also with the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some . import export . and another one .
user interface designer : som some bench - marker .
project manager : they are a ha they are at , benchmarking , that is the word i saw . i could not , another thing is there were there was a survey , and it came out that people like to buy things from a single large provider , instead of those who are partnering with us . so , we must bring it as if real reaction is big company , a trustful company , and it has m
marketing executive : how i know a marketing name for our product . r _ th r _ to the third power . real reaction remote .
project manager : i had a i had another idea to put the whole idea of real reaction and a single brand and that thing .
marketing executive :  ?
project manager : when you put on remote , you see a just like when you telephone , you see a little animation .
user interface designer : logo .
marketing executive : bling .
project manager : real reaction remote . and with the motto , we put fashion in electronics . and then you go
marketing executive : but it has to be like a split second , because you have to put in a code also and
project manager : the
user interface designer : you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds , they will still remember it .
project manager : . but w th the idea from this thing is that we must present it as a as we are a single large provider who will stand on our own .
user interface designer : and it l linger on every time you see it .
industrial designer : if you have the l l_c_d _ screen , you can have a small logo i at the bottom . and it could just stay there .
marketing executive : that spins around like all the time .
project manager :
user interface designer : very annoying .
industrial designer : that spins around .
project manager : also also . but we are
marketing executive : it it is just like a globe in internet explorer .
project manager : y .
industrial designer : . , something like that .
project manager : but think about that things .
user interface designer : i it is for f
project manager : that is what they said in the master class .
user interface designer : for the next meeting , right ?
project manager : n , next meeting starts in thirty minutes .
marketing executive : who
project manager : so maybe you can go to paris and milan once again .
marketing executive : who who gave you the master class ?
project manager : the master class ?
marketing executive : ronald betenberg ?
project manager : franz mehler is . , very special , next session . idea that you the industrial development centre and user interface will work together on a prototype . and will drawing it on the smartboard . so that is a kinda new thing . and , the marketing expert will ke he will be keeping busy with the product evaluation . but the most specific instructions will be sent to you by email .
industrial designer : so we are going to work together right now ?
user interface designer : stay here and
project manager : the , dids this what i heard . i
marketing executive : in the master class .
project manager : not in the master class . so you just for the specific instructions and
user interface designer : p _ .
project manager : but it was a very good session , gentlemen .
user interface designer : no new email .
industrial designer : definitely .
marketing executive : me too .
project manager : i will all .
industrial designer : too .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and
marketing executive : too , lord .
project manager : give me a good evaluation .
marketing executive : guys , lot of success .
industrial designer : you wish .
user interface designer : see you .
industrial designer : m aye ?
project manager : cheers . see you in a half hour . but keep an eye on your laptops for a real
industrial designer : i am not if we because i saw something about individual actions .
project manager : but th there is still the my instructions that you will work together .
user interface designer : here ? or
project manager : that is not my problem .
user interface designer : . if you got a
project manager : bye - bye .
user interface designer : no . so stupid manager .
project manager : the project manager always works alone .
industrial designer : right . do you have new email ?
user interface designer : no .","the project manager went over the agenda . the industrial designer gave a presentation about the options for power source , materials and components . he recommended using kinetic energy , and having a double-curved rubber case . the group decided to combine batteries and kinetic energy . the marketing expert reported on current trends among young people for fresh fruity colours and spongy material . he explained that the remote should look fancy , and be technologically innovative and easy to use . he suggested using removable customisable covers , speech recognition , installing some games into the remote , and implementing a parental control feature . the user interface designer talked about having a simple layout with not many buttons . most features will be controlled through the menu . the group discussed the various options and decided to use games but not speech recognition . after a lot of discussion they decided to implement a simple parental control feature . the project manager talked about what he had learned at a masterclass on knowledge management . the group discussed how to incorporate the company logo and motto onto the remote , including having an animated logo on the touch screen . the project manager gave the group instructions about what to do before the next meeting . the industrial designer and user interface designer will work together on a prototype , using the smartboard . the marketing expert will work on the product evaluation . the energy source will be a combination of batteries and kinetic energy . the case will be double-curved and made of rubber , with fruity-coloured removable covers . there will be a touch screen and not many buttons . the remote will include games and a simple parental control feature . it will not use speech recognition . the user interface designer had problems with his laptop while he was preparing his presentation . the group were unsure about how to implement a parental control feature , or if it would be worth the time and money .
","the marketing expert and industrial designer presented their prototype to the group and discussed the options for energy sources , materials , and components . the project manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting . the group decided to use solar power to power the device . the user interface designer presented two existing products on the market - a voice recognition remote and a children's remote - and discussed what features in terms of appearance and functionality to include in the remote the group is designing . the remote will not feature an lcd screen . it will be curved and shaped like a teletubbie . there will be no display physically featured on the remote itself; instead the buttons will be on the inside of the remote . to incorporate the company logo , the logo will be displayed through the buttons . the device will use a kinetic battery . the solar power source was discussed , along with other options such as rechargeable internal batteries or a stand . the prototype was evaluated on the basis of its look and feel , technological innovation , ease of use , and its ability to be misplaced . overall , the prototype performed quite well. the group were satisfied with the prototype . however , they were unsatisfied with the lack of information about the cost of components . they did not know how much the battery would cost . they also had difficulties setting up their computers and using the meeting-room equipment .",x,,x,x,x,x,,,6.0,BART-Baseline

user interface designer : hello .
industrial designer : hi .
marketing executive : hey , project manager .
user interface designer : project manager , i have something to tell you . i have a little problems with my laptop . and s so i had a little less time to complete . no , a little problem , big problem . thought
marketing executive : what was it , problem ?
user interface designer : it did not work anymore .
marketing executive : the laptop ?
user interface designer : the entire windows
marketing executive : it hang hung .
user interface designer : it it hung .
marketing executive : ha - ha . project manager .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : you are our project manager .
project manager : your project manager . welcome to the conceptual design meeting for real reaction . , hello again . it is the same as the last time . , also this time there will be three presentations . and we must reach a decision on the remote control concepts . , and at the end , i , when i finish it off i have some input from a master class i visited .
user interface designer : during lunch , .
marketing executive : master .
user interface designer : he is the master , .
project manager : the the concepts on we where we must reach a decision on . , our from are of two sorts .
marketing executive : master of
project manager : components concepts and user interface concepts . , the first one is really about the total package with , we have decided to do a do the with a touch - screen that must be a case around it so it wo not be as breakable . how about the energy ? can you can you reload it or just have batteries which you must exchange ? , the user interface concept . , with the type and the supplements . so where to put what button . and i would say jans , can you begin ?
industrial designer : .
project manager : at the end , i will take notes and at the end of the minutes will be at the shared folder .
industrial designer : let me see . it is this one . , i will be talking about the components . , what i did was i reviewed previously used items by two different age groups .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : below forty five and above . and watch what the differences are and i checked , what d do we want , and how can we d aim a at the target group . what i found was that a senior citizens
marketing executive : i am .
industrial designer : ye , it is .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : they , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and such more . wood and chrome . and they like straightforward shapes . , they like luxurious styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more soft materials . think of the teletubbies , . , soft and fluffy and colourful and , shapes are curved and round . y y you get the picture . and they like sports and gaming , and that gives them the vitality . , so w , firs
project manager : one one little question .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : about the material . a soft material for a remote control ?
industrial designer : no , i will get to that .
project manager : .
industrial designer : you you will see . , f first off , let is start with the energy . w i had a choice between a few different sources . but the two basic sources that i found were the best possible were the battery versus kinetic . kinetic , that is when you move something , then it gets energy . i figured , that is ki kinda high - tech , when you have a remote control that , when you pick it up , it has power . that would be actually very , i figured . , we could also use a battery , that is a bit
marketing executive : but when the power gets low , you have to shake it ?
industrial designer : . , you c just you have to shake it around a little bit .
marketing executive : and
industrial designer : and then it d then it has some more energy . , y you could just go for a battery . or you can go for both ?
user interface designer : have you considered the option of using a solar panel ?
industrial designer : i actually did . but about solar panel is you have to have l light . , sunlight preferably .
user interface designer : w nah .
industrial designer : and you could use normal light , but you would not get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery . for ultimate b n use of solar panels , you could actually use you could use solar panels , but you ha you would have to implement them into the remote control , leaving you a bit less space for the interface .
marketing executive : . it is too less space .
industrial designer : so so i it wo what is actually i c just in f i have figured it out that , seeing that you will always be within the l distance of t_v _ , and the from t_v _ there comes a whole bunch of light . so it would actually power itself from a t_v _ . but , you just take up all the space , and you would not have the full amount of power actually used .
project manager : but you prefer kinetic ?
industrial designer : i prefer kinetic because it is , the costs are not that much higher , and , ju just a bit more high - tech than a normal battery .
project manager : but you do not move a remote control too much .
industrial designer : if no , but d , you pick it up and you press buttons and y , you
project manager : and that is enough to keep the energy level
industrial designer : actually it is . and it if it is not , you just shake it a bit and add with power up again . but , what l what jarek said , you could use a battery that you would just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . and for rest , you would just add juice on the battery .
marketing executive : and when the battery does not work , i usually shake it too . so
project manager : tim .
industrial designer : exactly .
marketing executive : like slamming on it . it is exactly the same .
industrial designer : and so that , f furthermore , you we checked the cases . we have different options concerning the cases . you ha i you sim you simply add a basic standard model it was square and i figured that is a bit boring . so you we could go for the single curved or the double curved . , single curve , it is just a , , it is just a curve . or but you could go in a in an double curves . and that is like several different dimensions . that gives you an whole new effec
project manager : dynamic dynamic look ?
industrial designer : that gives you a younger and more high - tech look , i f i figured . but , that we will discuss later .
marketing executive : but , are you going to draw it ?
industrial designer : what ?
user interface designer : th th .
industrial designer : you want me to draw in three - d _ ?
marketing executive : the , i c i ca not imagine .
industrial designer : i ca i could show you .
marketing executive : i ca not imagine how it looks like .
industrial designer : let is say y you let is say that is your standard
marketing executive : design .
industrial designer : that is a bit your d standard design . but you could actually go like something like this .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : and then in three - d _ effect you could go so y you just , this is a this bit difficulty in i did not take a major in art . so but but you could have a whole new the back the depth , you could just play around a bit with .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : you you do not have to use standard
project manager : a little artistic .
industrial designer : you could y it leaves more space for creativity . that might be an idea , but just a , furthermore , plastic versus rubber ? you we could choose what is better , plastic or rubber . i ch prefer rubber because it feels .
project manager : it is soft .
industrial designer : it is soft and it is that i like soft .
project manager : that is the material the younger people want , ai not it ?
industrial designer : plastic is plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , like plastic your your i usually associate plastic with something that is cheap . that is maybe just me , but , we could , talk about it later . furthermore , buttons . traditional or a touch screen . , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so i figured i will just leave it at the l_c_d _ . and chip set , if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go with a simple chip set . but if we decide to go on a n l_c_d _ screen , we would use an we have to use an a advanced chip set . and that would bring the necessary costs with it . so that is something we th have to keep in mind . if it is not manageable budget - wise , we would have to go over to sim to simple buttons .
marketing executive : we are going to sell tell ten millions of them . so i bet a big company in korea or taiwan , like samsung , can give us a big discount on the chips , so
industrial designer : probably .
marketing executive : u usually , chips are are not more expensive than one dollar .
industrial designer : probably , but but , that is
marketing executive : so that that should not be a real issue , .
industrial designer : that should not be that big a issue . i will just add , i put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit . what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ?
user interface designer : you should use kinetic as a back - up .
industrial designer : you should we should
marketing executive : a combination .
user interface designer : a combination , .
industrial designer : a combination . , you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . when you pick it up , it charges up .
marketing executive : like an aku acu , .
industrial designer : i know .
user interface designer : .
project manager : just like the watch from seiko .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : psycho - kinetic .
industrial designer : i con exactly . what what do you think ?
project manager : i would prefer both too .
industrial designer : you agree ?
project manager : .
industrial designer : ?
marketing executive : combine them .
industrial designer : that would bring the m some more costs , but the who cares , right . that is the project manager is problem .
user interface designer : buy a fifty cents battery and
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : fifty cent , why does not and then we have single - curved versus double - curved .
user interface designer : maybe i have something in my presentation to cope with that .
industrial designer : that no , we will just and , plastic versus rubber .
marketing executive : rubber .
project manager : rubber .
industrial designer : rubber ?
user interface designer : is not possible to make combination with rubber is or bendable remotes where you have got a .
industrial designer : you
user interface designer : or do you think it
industrial designer : i figured it will be m rather than hard
user interface designer : rubber casing , .
industrial designer : nah , rubber c this is a casing , . rubber casing ,
marketing executive : rather hard .
industrial designer : because if you use an d a touch - screen , it is just a casing around it . so , you could go for plastic , but i figured
user interface designer : d maybe ask it right now the question that i have .
industrial designer : i would choose rubber .
user interface designer : is it possible of is it necessary to make a touch - screen square ?
industrial designer : m i .
marketing executive : that touch - screens are generally square . but it is the case you put around it that makes the shape .
user interface designer : we are we put fashion in electronics ,
industrial designer : that is not
user interface designer : so maybe we can
marketing executive : ? , but if you have a square l_c_d _ screen , and you put a case around it that has like bulbs or that covers part of the l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer :  .
industrial designer : that would cover it .
marketing executive : that
industrial designer : that that would solve the problem .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : that is it is custom customisable and
industrial designer : so so what are the opinions ? rubber or plastic ? i prefer rubber .
marketing executive : me too .
project manager : me too .
industrial designer : you too ?
user interface designer : that is good .
industrial designer : you ? you you seemed to hesitate a bit .
user interface designer : as long a as long as it is firm , and you do not it is not bendable , i th that goes too far .
industrial designer : it should not flop over when you hold it in your hand no , that that is gonna the the chip set will hold it firm in place , and a l_c_d _ screen also
user interface designer : it might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor .
industrial designer : it m might it might . , tra traditional versus l_c_d _ , i figured we all set on that . and , then also the simple versus advanced . i figure if we go for l _ l_c_d _ , we should have the advanced . so that should not be a problem . , that is my , you are welcome .
marketing executive : can i do my thing ?
project manager : . do your thing , tim .
marketing executive : it
user interface designer : do your thing .
project manager : bring it on .
marketing executive : expert map . last week i went to paris and milan for some trend - watching . for marketing . our research and development department and i went to paris and milan . in paris and milan , we asked different people , differing in age and in income , the amount of money to spend , what they like in design and material nowadays . our main audience , so that is people below forty , prefer the following . at first , the colours of fruit . very basic colours , like janus explained . , fresh colours , green , red , strawberry red , yellow , banana yellow . , considering material , . they like spongy material ,
user interface designer : spongeball .
marketing executive : like a sponge - ball . like a s soft material . janus m mentioned it also . he did some findings himself .
industrial designer : the teletubbies sh
marketing executive : you wer you were not in paris ? like big g flashy colours .
project manager : flashy .
marketing executive : it is , . , our secondary audience , people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . , materials like wood that
project manager : but wood is not a material you which you build a remote control of .
industrial designer : you could . you you could .
marketing executive : no n j just a w
project manager : but never seen one .
user interface designer : it will float .
marketing executive : no , but just a wooden look .
project manager : case . , a wooden look , .
marketing executive : like you have those fake panels on the floor .
user interface designer : tables .
marketing executive : the that is not wood anyway , but but , that is our secondary audience . so , we decided to take the people below forty . so , that this does not apply . , there are some overall thoughts about new remote controls . they have to look fancy . , they should be technological in innovative . that means there have to be fancy things in . , and easy to use . but that is common . my personal preferences . we have to aim at a mu at the main audience . and , therefore use fresh colours .
project manager : would you prefer that you can choose the colour of your remote control or
marketing executive : i will come to that in a second point . here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . to customise your own remote control . like the nokia the removable covers , just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one . , a third , material being used could be like rubber . , two advantages . , it fits within the current market trends . and it adds safety to your remote when you drop it . so to come back to your question , and the people in milan and paris also think that the rubber should be pretty hard . like seen on regular mobile phones . actually , they have a lot in common . the phones and the
industrial designer : i actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so .
marketing executive : .
project manager : maybe you could use your remote as a phone .
user interface designer : hey .
industrial designer : hey .
project manager : there are numbers on it , so
industrial designer : that might be a next step .
marketing executive : exactly . , in my second sheet of personal preferences , we have to reconsider the speech function recognition . , it is very innovative .
project manager : so that you say s_p_s_s _ , and it goes to
marketing executive : like something . you you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak speech recognition and . but , we have to keep the cost in mind , but it
user interface designer : twelve fifty
marketing executive : it can be very expensive . , building games like snake or tetris to amuse the younger users . , also the link with mobile phones .
project manager : but you do not use that th games when you watching television , .
marketing executive : no , but no , . but you do not use games when you are d when you are making a telephone call . it is just the same .
user interface designer : when your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else .
project manager : .
marketing executive : when you are at college .
project manager : you take your remote control with you .
user interface designer : take it .
industrial designer : you take your remote with you to school .
marketing executive : no . you al you also take t you take your ipac and go play games . , i do that , but and third , i stick with it , the log - in functionality with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension .
user interface designer : . s
industrial designer : very .
marketing executive : that is it .
project manager : great .
user interface designer : in . the interface contents . that is a just simple powerpoint mock - up i want to m make it more as dynamic for you so i will draw there . but , the main concept is take one big touch screen . , always display the primary buttons clear and visible . maybe even li like this with u uses of a lot of space . and make the menu structure changeable . so if you press system , that is , m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or one , can fit in . or maybe even a step further when you want to t have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . and other buttons can may be displayed here if that is necessary . and , how do we want to look at f does a remote look , it is you have got ta hold it in one hand . so the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands . and some remotes you can use with your thumb . but that is too difficult for this one . so you can make it s a little broader . and maybe use your thumb on the main buttons . and use your other hands on the menu structure . so here are gonna be the program buttons . one , two , three , four , et cetera . and the volume control and program control maybe . and , down here , i added , this could be one big l_c_d _ . , the menu structure . so you can use it in this way . one thing you have got ta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . , know that if you are changing the menu structure here , and , i still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . but if you are programming the colour of the t_v _ , do not display twenty other options that are possible . just keep it as simple as possible . and do not use too many levels . do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un - plus , and push plus twenty times . but just the just in one button if possible . and , you kn you all know the t_v _ levels . , channel one , two . and when you get to n to ten , ye and want to go back , you have a problem . just m most modern t_v_s , you press one zero , and it goes to ten . and else , to one and through after that . so the s a button less . and , things like teletext , put them in the menu . things like
marketing executive : . , what do you think about a back - and - forth come - up button ?
user interface designer : w , i find i must trying to tell it .
marketing executive : l like in internet explorer .
user interface designer : is volume plus and minus ? and this is program plus and minus .
marketing executive : but does it that is for going from four to five .
user interface designer : yes .
marketing executive : but if you go from two to eight , and you want
user interface designer : or if you are watching studio sports on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two
marketing executive : and on two . that you can switch easy .
user interface designer : yes , that is a good idea . but , m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure .
marketing executive : it is .
user interface designer : and if you are using that button a lot of times , the menu will still be displayed on the screen . you just do not have to play games in - between . but if you are really switching between two channels , you wo not have time to d use the other options .
marketing executive : no .
user interface designer : already told that . that is my conclusion .
project manager : we can discuss a little about the three revolutionary things tim came with . the parental control , the games , and the voice recognition . there is n not too much decision on that one so that parental control is a good function to put in the remote . i how you think about it .
user interface designer : i agree , just put it in the menu structure somewhere . , system properties , parental control .
marketing executive : but what i see how i see it is you put it on the remote and then you have like a windows log - on screen with parents , children . something like that .
user interface designer : w , .
marketing executive : and w when you want to use the parents option , you have to
user interface designer : it it has to be fast . you do not want to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and twenty seconds for the log - on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings .
project manager : no but most people find it much more important that their children do not watch sex or violence on the television , and ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can finally watch it because of that .
user interface designer : why you c may use like when there is x_p _ , a simple log - on , d you just push one or two or three .
marketing executive : . pu push parents .
user interface designer : and if you push parents , then
marketing executive : that then you have to go to three - digit log - in .
user interface designer : . and if you puts a ye
marketing executive : like two one three .
user interface designer : and if you w you push p children , you do not have to log in , but you can only watch children is channels or
marketing executive : it automatically goes .
industrial designer : i if it is worth the time and effort we are going to spend on it . because it is a simple function , but it is gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time to programming it . because you will have to start working with the profiles and such . and i am not if it is actually worth investing that much time and effort into it .
project manager : that is a b there is a big market for it ,
industrial designer : i what
project manager : because you , you read many times in magazines same , and you heard on the news that he , they believe that children are influenced by the television ,
marketing executive : v violent t_v _ .
project manager : and , we are aiming to below forty years . but there are a lot of people will below forty who have children in young age who want to not watch violent or
user interface designer : maybe some idea on that . just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , if my grandad would buy this remote , he would not want to bother with all the things to do . just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles .
project manager : that is a that is a better idea ?
marketing executive : w it just has to be w when it is deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain . but if you want to install it personally if i got kids , and i could choose between two remote controls . one w with parent control and one without , and i would buy the one with .
project manager : with and one without .
user interface designer : b , still some question i have about how to incorporate those ones .
marketing executive : i th .
user interface designer : you are thinking about some channels they can not see , but , i when , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock in the evening violent films and movies will come and maybe some timing will be needed instead of channels , because if you are watching , i , you are in the at day , cartoons will come up m on maybe friday night .
project manager : maybe it can work with show view . , you can control your video recorder with show view . , when you tick in a number , it will start and end recording . but maybe there is some option that t the show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out .
user interface designer : the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show - view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all ,
project manager : .
user interface designer : will have to decide
marketing executive : but that is not possible .
user interface designer : that is not possible .
industrial designer : but , if you want to i i if we in incorporate the parental control , let is say we do , and whatever , cho child just goes up to the t_v _ and presses up . , nob nobody is stopping the child from checking the channel .
user interface designer : you could say if parental control is only it will go from fourteen to sixteen with the page - up then , but
industrial designer : but that , i am not because for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the remote control , so it would , have to be constant signalling . what m what may be better is to incorporate an a separate device that you can program with the remote control . and that provides parental control , . and that is just an optional device . so there is n that is there is besides the remote control , you will have a separate
project manager : i would not put it in an optional device . that that then it becomes too much , .
industrial designer : ?
project manager : if we do it , we must do it in a ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise .
user interface designer : on a separate menu option .
marketing executive : and and w when you install another device , children can still go up to the t_v _ , p pop open the thing and g
industrial designer : that is true . that is true ,
marketing executive : go to a channel .
industrial designer : but at same instant , same happens when you have remote control . so
marketing executive : but
industrial designer : but , only difference is the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control , and those people would not necessary want it .
marketing executive : it is
industrial designer : so , you would be
marketing executive : . but it is just an added feature .
project manager : . and what do you guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? i personally think that becomes too much .
user interface designer : i
project manager : it is more like it gets you to the functionality , but
user interface designer : a mail too from management that it is very popular to use voice recon recognition . but i do not think when you are watching t_v _ , hearing loud noises from the t_v _ , someone screaming one , and you f the channel switches , .
marketing executive : like f voice recognition is too much , . but
project manager : and games ?
marketing executive : games . it does not
industrial designer : . see games happening .
user interface designer : w you can put it on chip anyway , so
project manager : that would
user interface designer : as long as it is is not a primary feature of the remote ,
marketing executive : that that does not c that does not co
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : that does not cost a lot of extra resources , .
project manager : so that will that must be in it , you think ?
industrial designer : that will be .
project manager : . so the games are in it . the voice recognition are not . and the parental control are
user interface designer : optional in
project manager : optional ?
marketing executive : it is in it . but too ma so , but
user interface designer : but how we do it ? , also it is a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . so we should make it too complex . is t some menu function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on . but how it is gonna work will f be a problem .
project manager : but will there like the first idea from you can buy it without and with parental contr control ? or are we going to put it in and just
user interface designer : ye best would be to put it in and make it an menu option .
marketing executive : to put
user interface designer : you can put on
marketing executive : to put it in always .
user interface designer : and you can just s when you buy it , you can select personal preference , parental control on , and the password .
industrial designer : i . i figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with a receiver in it . so you could actually easily build in parental control . but it would be more expensive . so , a and that way you could make cheap model and a expensive model . could ma make the simple model and the deluxe model , .
user interface designer : it is a p .
marketing executive : but t_v_s are not capable of sending .
industrial designer : yes they are .
marketing executive : they were just
project manager : you yo
industrial designer : you have some t_v_s any
marketing executive : a able to receive . but
project manager : but most often not .
industrial designer : . that is true , that is true .
user interface designer : maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you can not watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you can not watch all channels after ten o'clock . and there is just some little clock in the remote .
industrial designer : you could easily to the mote control .
marketing executive : j just some rules .
industrial designer : but you still have the problem about the television itself .
user interface designer : no , no , it is very simple . there th i h i have seen some of remotes who have a clock in it . so , the remote does does not transmit when it is after twelve clock .
marketing executive : but , on the t_v _
user interface designer : ?
marketing executive : at least my t_v _ , is a compartment which you can press . and there are buttons behind it which you can use , if you d if you do not have a
user interface designer : that is to put it very blunt , that is not our problem . just have the parents buy some glue and it is not a part of the remote .
industrial designer : that is true .
user interface designer : you have to f .
industrial designer : you could go like
user interface designer : or make it ourselves very diffic
industrial designer : that would actually make things a lot more easy . you could just blame it on television and make it their problem . , i figured i figure we could do that . , i am not what marketing thinks about it , but
marketing executive : or j . i have to consult my legal advisor about it .
project manager : . so we have decided on the things that from janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic . the case will be double - curved and rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour that with cover is removable . the buttons will be touch - screen . but there may not be too many buttons . and in the menu structure , there must not to be five minutes to go . , too many levels . and it must be easy to use . the parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . and the games are in it . so we have decided , .
marketing executive : consensus .
project manager : little more .
marketing executive : . i have one thing left . maybe for jerome .
user interface designer : ? i am listening .
marketing executive : the views . maybe it is handy to build in an expert view and a simple view .
project manager : like a like a moat or s .
user interface designer :
industrial designer : user profile .
marketing executive : like at in the experts view , you have a lot of more buttons .
project manager : but you have that in the
user interface designer : what i was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you do not use it is simple .
project manager : you use the
user interface designer : and when you push system properties , entire list pops up with e ev all f you can program .
project manager : . it is already incorporated a little in that concept .
marketing executive : . fairly enough .
industrial designer : you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users .
marketing executive : wh which buttons you like or not .
industrial designer : which buttons do you want to in it . because you can like build in a back - forward button , and some po somebody would just want to watch two channels .
marketing executive : just leave the other numbers away .
industrial designer : you could m have people want that .
project manager : we take it to the other meeting , i have a little w little chat to do
industrial designer : .
project manager : and then we finish .
marketing executive : a little chat .
project manager : i went to a master class and two things are can come in handy for us . first thing is we talked about knowledge management . knowledge engineering and the fact that the idea of knowledge , sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is like that . it is it is very hot at the moment , so it is mostly for the management expert to look what other
marketing executive : marketing .
project manager : marketing or did i said management ?
marketing executive : management .
project manager : just talking about myself .
marketing executive : that is my function , to
project manager : w what other companies had to also with the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some . import export . and another one .
user interface designer : som some bench - marker .
project manager : they are a ha they are at , benchmarking , that is the word i saw . i could not , another thing is there were there was a survey , and it came out that people like to buy things from a single large provider , instead of those who are partnering with us . so , we must bring it as if real reaction is big company , a trustful company , and it has m
marketing executive : how i know a marketing name for our product . r _ th r _ to the third power . real reaction remote .
project manager : i had a i had another idea to put the whole idea of real reaction and a single brand and that thing .
marketing executive :  ?
project manager : when you put on remote , you see a just like when you telephone , you see a little animation .
user interface designer : logo .
marketing executive : bling .
project manager : real reaction remote . and with the motto , we put fashion in electronics . and then you go
marketing executive : but it has to be like a split second , because you have to put in a code also and
project manager : the
user interface designer : you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds , they will still remember it .
project manager : . but w th the idea from this thing is that we must present it as a as we are a single large provider who will stand on our own .
user interface designer : and it l linger on every time you see it .
industrial designer : if you have the l l_c_d _ screen , you can have a small logo i at the bottom . and it could just stay there .
marketing executive : that spins around like all the time .
project manager :
user interface designer : very annoying .
industrial designer : that spins around .
project manager : also also . but we are
marketing executive : it it is just like a globe in internet explorer .
project manager : y .
industrial designer : . , something like that .
project manager : but think about that things .
user interface designer : i it is for f
project manager : that is what they said in the master class .
user interface designer : for the next meeting , right ?
project manager : n , next meeting starts in thirty minutes .
marketing executive : who
project manager : so maybe you can go to paris and milan once again .
marketing executive : who who gave you the master class ?
project manager : the master class ?
marketing executive : ronald betenberg ?
project manager : franz mehler is . , very special , next session . idea that you the industrial development centre and user interface will work together on a prototype . and will drawing it on the smartboard . so that is a kinda new thing . and , the marketing expert will ke he will be keeping busy with the product evaluation . but the most specific instructions will be sent to you by email .
industrial designer : so we are going to work together right now ?
user interface designer : stay here and
project manager : the , dids this what i heard . i
marketing executive : in the master class .
project manager : not in the master class . so you just for the specific instructions and
user interface designer : p _ .
project manager : but it was a very good session , gentlemen .
user interface designer : no new email .
industrial designer : definitely .
marketing executive : me too .
project manager : i will all .
industrial designer : too .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and
marketing executive : too , lord .
project manager : give me a good evaluation .
marketing executive : guys , lot of success .
industrial designer : you wish .
user interface designer : see you .
industrial designer : m aye ?
project manager : cheers . see you in a half hour . but keep an eye on your laptops for a real
industrial designer : i am not if we because i saw something about individual actions .
project manager : but th there is still the my instructions that you will work together .
user interface designer : here ? or
project manager : that is not my problem .
user interface designer : . if you got a
project manager : bye - bye .
user interface designer : no . so stupid manager .
project manager : the project manager always works alone .
industrial designer : right . do you have new email ?
user interface designer : no .","the project manager went over the agenda . the industrial designer gave a presentation about the options for power source , materials and components . he recommended using kinetic energy , and having a double-curved rubber case . the group decided to combine batteries and kinetic energy . the marketing expert reported on current trends among young people for fresh fruity colours and spongy material . he explained that the remote should look fancy , and be technologically innovative and easy to use . he suggested using removable customisable covers , speech recognition , installing some games into the remote , and implementing a parental control feature . the user interface designer talked about having a simple layout with not many buttons . most features will be controlled through the menu . the group discussed the various options and decided to use games but not speech recognition . after a lot of discussion they decided to implement a simple parental control feature . the project manager talked about what he had learned at a masterclass on knowledge management . the group discussed how to incorporate the company logo and motto onto the remote , including having an animated logo on the touch screen . the project manager gave the group instructions about what to do before the next meeting . the industrial designer and user interface designer will work together on a prototype , using the smartboard . the marketing expert will work on the product evaluation . the energy source will be a combination of batteries and kinetic energy . the case will be double-curved and made of rubber , with fruity-coloured removable covers . there will be a touch screen and not many buttons . the remote will include games and a simple parental control feature . it will not use speech recognition . the user interface designer had problems with his laptop while he was preparing his presentation . the group were unsure about how to implement a parental control feature , or if it would be worth the time and money .
","the project manager opened the meeting and introduced the upcoming project . the marketing expert gave an evaluation of user requirements and led the team in a discussion in which the team discussed their target group and made decisions on the components and energy sources to use in their design . the industrial designer discussed the options for energy sources and materials to use for the case and buttons . the user interface designer presented his concept for the remote which he called the ""millennium remote control"". the group discussed what buttons would be needed to operate the device . he suggested using a scroll wheel on the side of the remote to switch between two channels . the group then discussed the option to use a solar panel or kinetic battery . the research into user requirements showed that younger people like straightforward shapes and colors . they also like sports and video games . however , they do not like large expanses of colored rubber . the team decided to use some kind of rubber to give the device style . the corporate logo should be recognizable on the remote . the remote will have a scroll button . the device will use solar power . the energy source will be combined with kinetic energy . the case will be made of a soft , spongy material . large buttons will be included for the main functions such as on/off , channel up/down browsing , volume and program selection , and for the teletext buttons . having a remote that operates either through voice recognition or through paging . what type of battery to use .",x,,x,,x,,,,6.0,BART-Cons
62,"project manager : hello again .
user interface designer : hello .
industrial designer : hi .
marketing executive : hey , project manager .
user interface designer : project manager , i have something to tell you . i have a little problems with my laptop . and s so i had a little less time to complete . no , a little problem , big problem . thought
marketing executive : what was it , problem ?
user interface designer : it did not work anymore .
marketing executive : the laptop ?
user interface designer : the entire windows
marketing executive : it hang hung .
user interface designer : it it hung .
marketing executive : ha - ha . project manager .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : you are our project manager .
project manager : your project manager . welcome to the conceptual design meeting for real reaction . , hello again . it is the same as the last time . , also this time there will be three presentations . and we must reach a decision on the remote control concepts . , and at the end , i , when i finish it off i have some input from a master class i visited .
user interface designer : during lunch , .
marketing executive : master .
user interface designer : he is the master , .
project manager : the the concepts on we where we must reach a decision on . , our from are of two sorts .
marketing executive : master of
project manager : components concepts and user interface concepts . , the first one is really about the total package with , we have decided to do a do the with a touch - screen that must be a case around it so it wo not be as breakable . how about the energy ? can you can you reload it or just have batteries which you must exchange ? , the user interface concept . , with the type and the supplements . so where to put what button . and i would say jans , can you begin ?
industrial designer : .
project manager : at the end , i will take notes and at the end of the minutes will be at the shared folder .
industrial designer : let me see . it is this one . , i will be talking about the components . , what i did was i reviewed previously used items by two different age groups .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : below forty five and above . and watch what the differences are and i checked , what d do we want , and how can we d aim a at the target group . what i found was that a senior citizens
marketing executive : i am .
industrial designer : ye , it is .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : they , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and such more . wood and chrome . and they like straightforward shapes . , they like luxurious styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more soft materials . think of the teletubbies , . , soft and fluffy and colourful and , shapes are curved and round . y y you get the picture . and they like sports and gaming , and that gives them the vitality . , so w , firs
project manager : one one little question .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : about the material . a soft material for a remote control ?
industrial designer : no , i will get to that .
project manager : .
industrial designer : you you will see . , f first off , let is start with the energy . w i had a choice between a few different sources . but the two basic sources that i found were the best possible were the battery versus kinetic . kinetic , that is when you move something , then it gets energy . i figured , that is ki kinda high - tech , when you have a remote control that , when you pick it up , it has power . that would be actually very , i figured . , we could also use a battery , that is a bit
marketing executive : but when the power gets low , you have to shake it ?
industrial designer : . , you c just you have to shake it around a little bit .
marketing executive : and
industrial designer : and then it d then it has some more energy . , y you could just go for a battery . or you can go for both ?
user interface designer : have you considered the option of using a solar panel ?
industrial designer : i actually did . but about solar panel is you have to have l light . , sunlight preferably .
user interface designer : w nah .
industrial designer : and you could use normal light , but you would not get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery . for ultimate b n use of solar panels , you could actually use you could use solar panels , but you ha you would have to implement them into the remote control , leaving you a bit less space for the interface .
marketing executive : . it is too less space .
industrial designer : so so i it wo what is actually i c just in f i have figured it out that , seeing that you will always be within the l distance of t_v _ , and the from t_v _ there comes a whole bunch of light . so it would actually power itself from a t_v _ . but , you just take up all the space , and you would not have the full amount of power actually used .
project manager : but you prefer kinetic ?
industrial designer : i prefer kinetic because it is , the costs are not that much higher , and , ju just a bit more high - tech than a normal battery .
project manager : but you do not move a remote control too much .
industrial designer : if no , but d , you pick it up and you press buttons and y , you
project manager : and that is enough to keep the energy level
industrial designer : actually it is . and it if it is not , you just shake it a bit and add with power up again . but , what l what jarek said , you could use a battery that you would just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . and for rest , you would just add juice on the battery .
marketing executive : and when the battery does not work , i usually shake it too . so
project manager : tim .
industrial designer : exactly .
marketing executive : like slamming on it . it is exactly the same .
industrial designer : and so that , f furthermore , you we checked the cases . we have different options concerning the cases . you ha i you sim you simply add a basic standard model it was square and i figured that is a bit boring . so you we could go for the single curved or the double curved . , single curve , it is just a , , it is just a curve . or but you could go in a in an double curves . and that is like several different dimensions . that gives you an whole new effec
project manager : dynamic dynamic look ?
industrial designer : that gives you a younger and more high - tech look , i f i figured . but , that we will discuss later .
marketing executive : but , are you going to draw it ?
industrial designer : what ?
user interface designer : th th .
industrial designer : you want me to draw in three - d _ ?
marketing executive : the , i c i ca not imagine .
industrial designer : i ca i could show you .
marketing executive : i ca not imagine how it looks like .
industrial designer : let is say y you let is say that is your standard
marketing executive : design .
industrial designer : that is a bit your d standard design . but you could actually go like something like this .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : and then in three - d _ effect you could go so y you just , this is a this bit difficulty in i did not take a major in art . so but but you could have a whole new the back the depth , you could just play around a bit with .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : you you do not have to use standard
project manager : a little artistic .
industrial designer : you could y it leaves more space for creativity . that might be an idea , but just a , furthermore , plastic versus rubber ? you we could choose what is better , plastic or rubber . i ch prefer rubber because it feels .
project manager : it is soft .
industrial designer : it is soft and it is that i like soft .
project manager : that is the material the younger people want , ai not it ?
industrial designer : plastic is plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , like plastic your your i usually associate plastic with something that is cheap . that is maybe just me , but , we could , talk about it later . furthermore , buttons . traditional or a touch screen . , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so i figured i will just leave it at the l_c_d _ . and chip set , if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go with a simple chip set . but if we decide to go on a n l_c_d _ screen , we would use an we have to use an a advanced chip set . and that would bring the necessary costs with it . so that is something we th have to keep in mind . if it is not manageable budget - wise , we would have to go over to sim to simple buttons .
marketing executive : we are going to sell tell ten millions of them . so i bet a big company in korea or taiwan , like samsung , can give us a big discount on the chips , so
industrial designer : probably .
marketing executive : u usually , chips are are not more expensive than one dollar .
industrial designer : probably , but but , that is
marketing executive : so that that should not be a real issue , .
industrial designer : that should not be that big a issue . i will just add , i put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit . what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ?
user interface designer : you should use kinetic as a back - up .
industrial designer : you should we should
marketing executive : a combination .
user interface designer : a combination , .
industrial designer : a combination . , you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . when you pick it up , it charges up .
marketing executive : like an aku acu , .
industrial designer : i know .
user interface designer : .
project manager : just like the watch from seiko .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : psycho - kinetic .
industrial designer : i con exactly . what what do you think ?
project manager : i would prefer both too .
industrial designer : you agree ?
project manager : .
industrial designer : ?
marketing executive : combine them .
industrial designer : that would bring the m some more costs , but the who cares , right . that is the project manager is problem .
user interface designer : buy a fifty cents battery and
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : fifty cent , why does not and then we have single - curved versus double - curved .
user interface designer : maybe i have something in my presentation to cope with that .
industrial designer : that no , we will just and , plastic versus rubber .
marketing executive : rubber .
project manager : rubber .
industrial designer : rubber ?
user interface designer : is not possible to make combination with rubber is or bendable remotes where you have got a .
industrial designer : you
user interface designer : or do you think it
industrial designer : i figured it will be m rather than hard
user interface designer : rubber casing , .
industrial designer : nah , rubber c this is a casing , . rubber casing ,
marketing executive : rather hard .
industrial designer : because if you use an d a touch - screen , it is just a casing around it . so , you could go for plastic , but i figured
user interface designer : d maybe ask it right now the question that i have .
industrial designer : i would choose rubber .
user interface designer : is it possible of is it necessary to make a touch - screen square ?
industrial designer : m i .
marketing executive : that touch - screens are generally square . but it is the case you put around it that makes the shape .
user interface designer : we are we put fashion in electronics ,
industrial designer : that is not
user interface designer : so maybe we can
marketing executive : ? , but if you have a square l_c_d _ screen , and you put a case around it that has like bulbs or that covers part of the l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer :  .
industrial designer : that would cover it .
marketing executive : that
industrial designer : that that would solve the problem .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : that is it is custom customisable and
industrial designer : so so what are the opinions ? rubber or plastic ? i prefer rubber .
marketing executive : me too .
project manager : me too .
industrial designer : you too ?
user interface designer : that is good .
industrial designer : you ? you you seemed to hesitate a bit .
user interface designer : as long a as long as it is firm , and you do not it is not bendable , i th that goes too far .
industrial designer : it should not flop over when you hold it in your hand no , that that is gonna the the chip set will hold it firm in place , and a l_c_d _ screen also
user interface designer : it might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor .
industrial designer : it m might it might . , tra traditional versus l_c_d _ , i figured we all set on that . and , then also the simple versus advanced . i figure if we go for l _ l_c_d _ , we should have the advanced . so that should not be a problem . , that is my , you are welcome .
marketing executive : can i do my thing ?
project manager : . do your thing , tim .
marketing executive : it
user interface designer : do your thing .
project manager : bring it on .
marketing executive : expert map . last week i went to paris and milan for some trend - watching . for marketing . our research and development department and i went to paris and milan . in paris and milan , we asked different people , differing in age and in income , the amount of money to spend , what they like in design and material nowadays . our main audience , so that is people below forty , prefer the following . at first , the colours of fruit . very basic colours , like janus explained . , fresh colours , green , red , strawberry red , yellow , banana yellow . , considering material , . they like spongy material ,
user interface designer : spongeball .
marketing executive : like a sponge - ball . like a s soft material . janus m mentioned it also . he did some findings himself .
industrial designer : the teletubbies sh
marketing executive : you wer you were not in paris ? like big g flashy colours .
project manager : flashy .
marketing executive : it is , . , our secondary audience , people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . , materials like wood that
project manager : but wood is not a material you which you build a remote control of .
industrial designer : you could . you you could .
marketing executive : no n j just a w
project manager : but never seen one .
user interface designer : it will float .
marketing executive : no , but just a wooden look .
project manager : case . , a wooden look , .
marketing executive : like you have those fake panels on the floor .
user interface designer : tables .
marketing executive : the that is not wood anyway , but but , that is our secondary audience . so , we decided to take the people below forty . so , that this does not apply . , there are some overall thoughts about new remote controls . they have to look fancy . , they should be technological in innovative . that means there have to be fancy things in . , and easy to use . but that is common . my personal preferences . we have to aim at a mu at the main audience . and , therefore use fresh colours .
project manager : would you prefer that you can choose the colour of your remote control or
marketing executive : i will come to that in a second point . here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . to customise your own remote control . like the nokia the removable covers , just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one . , a third , material being used could be like rubber . , two advantages . , it fits within the current market trends . and it adds safety to your remote when you drop it . so to come back to your question , and the people in milan and paris also think that the rubber should be pretty hard . like seen on regular mobile phones . actually , they have a lot in common . the phones and the
industrial designer : i actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so .
marketing executive : .
project manager : maybe you could use your remote as a phone .
user interface designer : hey .
industrial designer : hey .
project manager : there are numbers on it , so
industrial designer : that might be a next step .
marketing executive : exactly . , in my second sheet of personal preferences , we have to reconsider the speech function recognition . , it is very innovative .
project manager : so that you say s_p_s_s _ , and it goes to
marketing executive : like something . you you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak speech recognition and . but , we have to keep the cost in mind , but it
user interface designer : twelve fifty
marketing executive : it can be very expensive . , building games like snake or tetris to amuse the younger users . , also the link with mobile phones .
project manager : but you do not use that th games when you watching television , .
marketing executive : no , but no , . but you do not use games when you are d when you are making a telephone call . it is just the same .
user interface designer : when your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else .
project manager : .
marketing executive : when you are at college .
project manager : you take your remote control with you .
user interface designer : take it .
industrial designer : you take your remote with you to school .
marketing executive : no . you al you also take t you take your ipac and go play games . , i do that , but and third , i stick with it , the log - in functionality with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension .
user interface designer : . s
industrial designer : very .
marketing executive : that is it .
project manager : great .
user interface designer : in . the interface contents . that is a just simple powerpoint mock - up i want to m make it more as dynamic for you so i will draw there . but , the main concept is take one big touch screen . , always display the primary buttons clear and visible . maybe even li like this with u uses of a lot of space . and make the menu structure changeable . so if you press system , that is , m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or one , can fit in . or maybe even a step further when you want to t have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . and other buttons can may be displayed here if that is necessary . and , how do we want to look at f does a remote look , it is you have got ta hold it in one hand . so the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands . and some remotes you can use with your thumb . but that is too difficult for this one . so you can make it s a little broader . and maybe use your thumb on the main buttons . and use your other hands on the menu structure . so here are gonna be the program buttons . one , two , three , four , et cetera . and the volume control and program control maybe . and , down here , i added , this could be one big l_c_d _ . , the menu structure . so you can use it in this way . one thing you have got ta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . , know that if you are changing the menu structure here , and , i still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . but if you are programming the colour of the t_v _ , do not display twenty other options that are possible . just keep it as simple as possible . and do not use too many levels . do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un - plus , and push plus twenty times . but just the just in one button if possible . and , you kn you all know the t_v _ levels . , channel one , two . and when you get to n to ten , ye and want to go back , you have a problem . just m most modern t_v_s , you press one zero , and it goes to ten . and else , to one and through after that . so the s a button less . and , things like teletext , put them in the menu . things like
marketing executive : . , what do you think about a back - and - forth come - up button ?
user interface designer : w , i find i must trying to tell it .
marketing executive : l like in internet explorer .
user interface designer : is volume plus and minus ? and this is program plus and minus .
marketing executive : but does it that is for going from four to five .
user interface designer : yes .
marketing executive : but if you go from two to eight , and you want
user interface designer : or if you are watching studio sports on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two
marketing executive : and on two . that you can switch easy .
user interface designer : yes , that is a good idea . but , m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure .
marketing executive : it is .
user interface designer : and if you are using that button a lot of times , the menu will still be displayed on the screen . you just do not have to play games in - between . but if you are really switching between two channels , you wo not have time to d use the other options .
marketing executive : no .
user interface designer : already told that . that is my conclusion .
project manager : we can discuss a little about the three revolutionary things tim came with . the parental control , the games , and the voice recognition . there is n not too much decision on that one so that parental control is a good function to put in the remote . i how you think about it .
user interface designer : i agree , just put it in the menu structure somewhere . , system properties , parental control .
marketing executive : but what i see how i see it is you put it on the remote and then you have like a windows log - on screen with parents , children . something like that .
user interface designer : w , .
marketing executive : and w when you want to use the parents option , you have to
user interface designer : it it has to be fast . you do not want to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and twenty seconds for the log - on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings .
project manager : no but most people find it much more important that their children do not watch sex or violence on the television , and ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can finally watch it because of that .
user interface designer : why you c may use like when there is x_p _ , a simple log - on , d you just push one or two or three .
marketing executive : . pu push parents .
user interface designer : and if you push parents , then
marketing executive : that then you have to go to three - digit log - in .
user interface designer : . and if you puts a ye
marketing executive : like two one three .
user interface designer : and if you w you push p children , you do not have to log in , but you can only watch children is channels or
marketing executive : it automatically goes .
industrial designer : i if it is worth the time and effort we are going to spend on it . because it is a simple function , but it is gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time to programming it . because you will have to start working with the profiles and such . and i am not if it is actually worth investing that much time and effort into it .
project manager : that is a b there is a big market for it ,
industrial designer : i what
project manager : because you , you read many times in magazines same , and you heard on the news that he , they believe that children are influenced by the television ,
marketing executive : v violent t_v _ .
project manager : and , we are aiming to below forty years . but there are a lot of people will below forty who have children in young age who want to not watch violent or
user interface designer : maybe some idea on that . just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , if my grandad would buy this remote , he would not want to bother with all the things to do . just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles .
project manager : that is a that is a better idea ?
marketing executive : w it just has to be w when it is deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain . but if you want to install it personally if i got kids , and i could choose between two remote controls . one w with parent control and one without , and i would buy the one with .
project manager : with and one without .
user interface designer : b , still some question i have about how to incorporate those ones .
marketing executive : i th .
user interface designer : you are thinking about some channels they can not see , but , i when , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock in the evening violent films and movies will come and maybe some timing will be needed instead of channels , because if you are watching , i , you are in the at day , cartoons will come up m on maybe friday night .
project manager : maybe it can work with show view . , you can control your video recorder with show view . , when you tick in a number , it will start and end recording . but maybe there is some option that t the show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out .
user interface designer : the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show - view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all ,
project manager : .
user interface designer : will have to decide
marketing executive : but that is not possible .
user interface designer : that is not possible .
industrial designer : but , if you want to i i if we in incorporate the parental control , let is say we do , and whatever , cho child just goes up to the t_v _ and presses up . , nob nobody is stopping the child from checking the channel .
user interface designer : you could say if parental control is only it will go from fourteen to sixteen with the page - up then , but
industrial designer : but that , i am not because for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the remote control , so it would , have to be constant signalling . what m what may be better is to incorporate an a separate device that you can program with the remote control . and that provides parental control , . and that is just an optional device . so there is n that is there is besides the remote control , you will have a separate
project manager : i would not put it in an optional device . that that then it becomes too much , .
industrial designer : ?
project manager : if we do it , we must do it in a ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise .
user interface designer : on a separate menu option .
marketing executive : and and w when you install another device , children can still go up to the t_v _ , p pop open the thing and g
industrial designer : that is true . that is true ,
marketing executive : go to a channel .
industrial designer : but at same instant , same happens when you have remote control . so
marketing executive : but
industrial designer : but , only difference is the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control , and those people would not necessary want it .
marketing executive : it is
industrial designer : so , you would be
marketing executive : . but it is just an added feature .
project manager : . and what do you guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? i personally think that becomes too much .
user interface designer : i
project manager : it is more like it gets you to the functionality , but
user interface designer : a mail too from management that it is very popular to use voice recon recognition . but i do not think when you are watching t_v _ , hearing loud noises from the t_v _ , someone screaming one , and you f the channel switches , .
marketing executive : like f voice recognition is too much , . but
project manager : and games ?
marketing executive : games . it does not
industrial designer : . see games happening .
user interface designer : w you can put it on chip anyway , so
project manager : that would
user interface designer : as long as it is is not a primary feature of the remote ,
marketing executive : that that does not c that does not co
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : that does not cost a lot of extra resources , .
project manager : so that will that must be in it , you think ?
industrial designer : that will be .
project manager : . so the games are in it . the voice recognition are not . and the parental control are
user interface designer : optional in
project manager : optional ?
marketing executive : it is in it . but too ma so , but
user interface designer : but how we do it ? , also it is a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . so we should make it too complex . is t some menu function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on . but how it is gonna work will f be a problem .
project manager : but will there like the first idea from you can buy it without and with parental contr control ? or are we going to put it in and just
user interface designer : ye best would be to put it in and make it an menu option .
marketing executive : to put
user interface designer : you can put on
marketing executive : to put it in always .
user interface designer : and you can just s when you buy it , you can select personal preference , parental control on , and the password .
industrial designer : i . i figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with a receiver in it . so you could actually easily build in parental control . but it would be more expensive . so , a and that way you could make cheap model and a expensive model . could ma make the simple model and the deluxe model , .
user interface designer : it is a p .
marketing executive : but t_v_s are not capable of sending .
industrial designer : yes they are .
marketing executive : they were just
project manager : you yo
industrial designer : you have some t_v_s any
marketing executive : a able to receive . but
project manager : but most often not .
industrial designer : . that is true , that is true .
user interface designer : maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you can not watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you can not watch all channels after ten o'clock . and there is just some little clock in the remote .
industrial designer : you could easily to the mote control .
marketing executive : j just some rules .
industrial designer : but you still have the problem about the television itself .
user interface designer : no , no , it is very simple . there th i h i have seen some of remotes who have a clock in it . so , the remote does does not transmit when it is after twelve clock .
marketing executive : but , on the t_v _
user interface designer : ?
marketing executive : at least my t_v _ , is a compartment which you can press . and there are buttons behind it which you can use , if you d if you do not have a
user interface designer : that is to put it very blunt , that is not our problem . just have the parents buy some glue and it is not a part of the remote .
industrial designer : that is true .
user interface designer : you have to f .
industrial designer : you could go like
user interface designer : or make it ourselves very diffic
industrial designer : that would actually make things a lot more easy . you could just blame it on television and make it their problem . , i figured i figure we could do that . , i am not what marketing thinks about it , but
marketing executive : or j . i have to consult my legal advisor about it .
project manager : . so we have decided on the things that from janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic . the case will be double - curved and rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour that with cover is removable . the buttons will be touch - screen . but there may not be too many buttons . and in the menu structure , there must not to be five minutes to go . , too many levels . and it must be easy to use . the parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . and the games are in it . so we have decided , .
marketing executive : consensus .
project manager : little more .
marketing executive : . i have one thing left . maybe for jerome .
user interface designer : ? i am listening .
marketing executive : the views . maybe it is handy to build in an expert view and a simple view .
project manager : like a like a moat or s .
user interface designer :
industrial designer : user profile .
marketing executive : like at in the experts view , you have a lot of more buttons .
project manager : but you have that in the
user interface designer : what i was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you do not use it is simple .
project manager : you use the
user interface designer : and when you push system properties , entire list pops up with e ev all f you can program .
project manager : . it is already incorporated a little in that concept .
marketing executive : . fairly enough .
industrial designer : you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users .
marketing executive : wh which buttons you like or not .
industrial designer : which buttons do you want to in it . because you can like build in a back - forward button , and some po somebody would just want to watch two channels .
marketing executive : just leave the other numbers away .
industrial designer : you could m have people want that .
project manager : we take it to the other meeting , i have a little w little chat to do
industrial designer : .
project manager : and then we finish .
marketing executive : a little chat .
project manager : i went to a master class and two things are can come in handy for us . first thing is we talked about knowledge management . knowledge engineering and the fact that the idea of knowledge , sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is like that . it is it is very hot at the moment , so it is mostly for the management expert to look what other
marketing executive : marketing .
project manager : marketing or did i said management ?
marketing executive : management .
project manager : just talking about myself .
marketing executive : that is my function , to
project manager : w what other companies had to also with the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some . import export . and another one .
user interface designer : som some bench - marker .
project manager : they are a ha they are at , benchmarking , that is the word i saw . i could not , another thing is there were there was a survey , and it came out that people like to buy things from a single large provider , instead of those who are partnering with us . so , we must bring it as if real reaction is big company , a trustful company , and it has m
marketing executive : how i know a marketing name for our product . r _ th r _ to the third power . real reaction remote .
project manager : i had a i had another idea to put the whole idea of real reaction and a single brand and that thing .
marketing executive :  ?
project manager : when you put on remote , you see a just like when you telephone , you see a little animation .
user interface designer : logo .
marketing executive : bling .
project manager : real reaction remote . and with the motto , we put fashion in electronics . and then you go
marketing executive : but it has to be like a split second , because you have to put in a code also and
project manager : the
user interface designer : you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds , they will still remember it .
project manager : . but w th the idea from this thing is that we must present it as a as we are a single large provider who will stand on our own .
user interface designer : and it l linger on every time you see it .
industrial designer : if you have the l l_c_d _ screen , you can have a small logo i at the bottom . and it could just stay there .
marketing executive : that spins around like all the time .
project manager :
user interface designer : very annoying .
industrial designer : that spins around .
project manager : also also . but we are
marketing executive : it it is just like a globe in internet explorer .
project manager : y .
industrial designer : . , something like that .
project manager : but think about that things .
user interface designer : i it is for f
project manager : that is what they said in the master class .
user interface designer : for the next meeting , right ?
project manager : n , next meeting starts in thirty minutes .
marketing executive : who
project manager : so maybe you can go to paris and milan once again .
marketing executive : who who gave you the master class ?
project manager : the master class ?
marketing executive : ronald betenberg ?
project manager : franz mehler is . , very special , next session . idea that you the industrial development centre and user interface will work together on a prototype . and will drawing it on the smartboard . so that is a kinda new thing . and , the marketing expert will ke he will be keeping busy with the product evaluation . but the most specific instructions will be sent to you by email .
industrial designer : so we are going to work together right now ?
user interface designer : stay here and
project manager : the , dids this what i heard . i
marketing executive : in the master class .
project manager : not in the master class . so you just for the specific instructions and
user interface designer : p _ .
project manager : but it was a very good session , gentlemen .
user interface designer : no new email .
industrial designer : definitely .
marketing executive : me too .
project manager : i will all .
industrial designer : too .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and
marketing executive : too , lord .
project manager : give me a good evaluation .
marketing executive : guys , lot of success .
industrial designer : you wish .
user interface designer : see you .
industrial designer : m aye ?
project manager : cheers . see you in a half hour . but keep an eye on your laptops for a real
industrial designer : i am not if we because i saw something about individual actions .
project manager : but th there is still the my instructions that you will work together .
user interface designer : here ? or
project manager : that is not my problem .
user interface designer : . if you got a
project manager : bye - bye .
user interface designer : no . so stupid manager .
project manager : the project manager always works alone .
industrial designer : right . do you have new email ?
user interface designer : no .","the project manager went over the agenda . the industrial designer gave a presentation about the options for power source , materials and components . he recommended using kinetic energy , and having a double-curved rubber case . the group decided to combine batteries and kinetic energy . the marketing expert reported on current trends among young people for fresh fruity colours and spongy material . he explained that the remote should look fancy , and be technologically innovative and easy to use . he suggested using removable customisable covers , speech recognition , installing some games into the remote , and implementing a parental control feature . the user interface designer talked about having a simple layout with not many buttons . most features will be controlled through the menu . the group discussed the various options and decided to use games but not speech recognition . after a lot of discussion they decided to implement a simple parental control feature . the project manager talked about what he had learned at a masterclass on knowledge management . the group discussed how to incorporate the company logo and motto onto the remote , including having an animated logo on the touch screen . the project manager gave the group instructions about what to do before the next meeting . the industrial designer and user interface designer will work together on a prototype , using the smartboard . the marketing expert will work on the product evaluation . the energy source will be a combination of batteries and kinetic energy . the case will be double-curved and made of rubber , with fruity-coloured removable covers . there will be a touch screen and not many buttons . the remote will include games and a simple parental control feature . it will not use speech recognition . the user interface designer had problems with his laptop while he was preparing his presentation . the group were unsure about how to implement a parental control feature , or if it would be worth the time and money .
","the project manager opened the meeting and had the team members present their concepts for the remote control . the industrial designer presented two options for batteries and discussed how to make the remote more user-friendly . he also discussed the type of material to use and the number of buttons to include . after the marketing expert presented , the user interface designer discussed the problem with his laptop , and the team discussed what features to include in the remote such as a touch-screen interface , traditional materials , a kinetic battery and a rotating case for the case to rechargeable batteries . they discussed the possibility of using a battery powered remote with a rechargeable battery and decided to use a standard battery instead of a remote that charges itself by shaking a power source such as lithium battery . there was a discussion of the team's decision on the energy source and the possibility to use an recharging stand-powered remote that is powered by kinetic energy . when the remote gets low , it is energized , but it is not possible to include an programmable stand . it was decided that the remote should feature a scroll wheel , so that it could be used for a laptop",x,,,x,,x,,,5.0,T5-Baseline
63,"project manager : hello again .
user interface designer : hello .
industrial designer : hi .
marketing executive : hey , project manager .
user interface designer : project manager , i have something to tell you . i have a little problems with my laptop . and s so i had a little less time to complete . no , a little problem , big problem . thought
marketing executive : what was it , problem ?
user interface designer : it did not work anymore .
marketing executive : the laptop ?
user interface designer : the entire windows
marketing executive : it hang hung .
user interface designer : it it hung .
marketing executive : ha - ha . project manager .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : you are our project manager .
project manager : your project manager . welcome to the conceptual design meeting for real reaction . , hello again . it is the same as the last time . , also this time there will be three presentations . and we must reach a decision on the remote control concepts . , and at the end , i , when i finish it off i have some input from a master class i visited .
user interface designer : during lunch , .
marketing executive : master .
user interface designer : he is the master , .
project manager : the the concepts on we where we must reach a decision on . , our from are of two sorts .
marketing executive : master of
project manager : components concepts and user interface concepts . , the first one is really about the total package with , we have decided to do a do the with a touch - screen that must be a case around it so it wo not be as breakable . how about the energy ? can you can you reload it or just have batteries which you must exchange ? , the user interface concept . , with the type and the supplements . so where to put what button . and i would say jans , can you begin ?
industrial designer : .
project manager : at the end , i will take notes and at the end of the minutes will be at the shared folder .
industrial designer : let me see . it is this one . , i will be talking about the components . , what i did was i reviewed previously used items by two different age groups .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : below forty five and above . and watch what the differences are and i checked , what d do we want , and how can we d aim a at the target group . what i found was that a senior citizens
marketing executive : i am .
industrial designer : ye , it is .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : they , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and such more . wood and chrome . and they like straightforward shapes . , they like luxurious styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more soft materials . think of the teletubbies , . , soft and fluffy and colourful and , shapes are curved and round . y y you get the picture . and they like sports and gaming , and that gives them the vitality . , so w , firs
project manager : one one little question .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : about the material . a soft material for a remote control ?
industrial designer : no , i will get to that .
project manager : .
industrial designer : you you will see . , f first off , let is start with the energy . w i had a choice between a few different sources . but the two basic sources that i found were the best possible were the battery versus kinetic . kinetic , that is when you move something , then it gets energy . i figured , that is ki kinda high - tech , when you have a remote control that , when you pick it up , it has power . that would be actually very , i figured . , we could also use a battery , that is a bit
marketing executive : but when the power gets low , you have to shake it ?
industrial designer : . , you c just you have to shake it around a little bit .
marketing executive : and
industrial designer : and then it d then it has some more energy . , y you could just go for a battery . or you can go for both ?
user interface designer : have you considered the option of using a solar panel ?
industrial designer : i actually did . but about solar panel is you have to have l light . , sunlight preferably .
user interface designer : w nah .
industrial designer : and you could use normal light , but you would not get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery . for ultimate b n use of solar panels , you could actually use you could use solar panels , but you ha you would have to implement them into the remote control , leaving you a bit less space for the interface .
marketing executive : . it is too less space .
industrial designer : so so i it wo what is actually i c just in f i have figured it out that , seeing that you will always be within the l distance of t_v _ , and the from t_v _ there comes a whole bunch of light . so it would actually power itself from a t_v _ . but , you just take up all the space , and you would not have the full amount of power actually used .
project manager : but you prefer kinetic ?
industrial designer : i prefer kinetic because it is , the costs are not that much higher , and , ju just a bit more high - tech than a normal battery .
project manager : but you do not move a remote control too much .
industrial designer : if no , but d , you pick it up and you press buttons and y , you
project manager : and that is enough to keep the energy level
industrial designer : actually it is . and it if it is not , you just shake it a bit and add with power up again . but , what l what jarek said , you could use a battery that you would just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . and for rest , you would just add juice on the battery .
marketing executive : and when the battery does not work , i usually shake it too . so
project manager : tim .
industrial designer : exactly .
marketing executive : like slamming on it . it is exactly the same .
industrial designer : and so that , f furthermore , you we checked the cases . we have different options concerning the cases . you ha i you sim you simply add a basic standard model it was square and i figured that is a bit boring . so you we could go for the single curved or the double curved . , single curve , it is just a , , it is just a curve . or but you could go in a in an double curves . and that is like several different dimensions . that gives you an whole new effec
project manager : dynamic dynamic look ?
industrial designer : that gives you a younger and more high - tech look , i f i figured . but , that we will discuss later .
marketing executive : but , are you going to draw it ?
industrial designer : what ?
user interface designer : th th .
industrial designer : you want me to draw in three - d _ ?
marketing executive : the , i c i ca not imagine .
industrial designer : i ca i could show you .
marketing executive : i ca not imagine how it looks like .
industrial designer : let is say y you let is say that is your standard
marketing executive : design .
industrial designer : that is a bit your d standard design . but you could actually go like something like this .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : and then in three - d _ effect you could go so y you just , this is a this bit difficulty in i did not take a major in art . so but but you could have a whole new the back the depth , you could just play around a bit with .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : you you do not have to use standard
project manager : a little artistic .
industrial designer : you could y it leaves more space for creativity . that might be an idea , but just a , furthermore , plastic versus rubber ? you we could choose what is better , plastic or rubber . i ch prefer rubber because it feels .
project manager : it is soft .
industrial designer : it is soft and it is that i like soft .
project manager : that is the material the younger people want , ai not it ?
industrial designer : plastic is plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , like plastic your your i usually associate plastic with something that is cheap . that is maybe just me , but , we could , talk about it later . furthermore , buttons . traditional or a touch screen . , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so i figured i will just leave it at the l_c_d _ . and chip set , if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go with a simple chip set . but if we decide to go on a n l_c_d _ screen , we would use an we have to use an a advanced chip set . and that would bring the necessary costs with it . so that is something we th have to keep in mind . if it is not manageable budget - wise , we would have to go over to sim to simple buttons .
marketing executive : we are going to sell tell ten millions of them . so i bet a big company in korea or taiwan , like samsung , can give us a big discount on the chips , so
industrial designer : probably .
marketing executive : u usually , chips are are not more expensive than one dollar .
industrial designer : probably , but but , that is
marketing executive : so that that should not be a real issue , .
industrial designer : that should not be that big a issue . i will just add , i put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit . what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ?
user interface designer : you should use kinetic as a back - up .
industrial designer : you should we should
marketing executive : a combination .
user interface designer : a combination , .
industrial designer : a combination . , you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . when you pick it up , it charges up .
marketing executive : like an aku acu , .
industrial designer : i know .
user interface designer : .
project manager : just like the watch from seiko .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : psycho - kinetic .
industrial designer : i con exactly . what what do you think ?
project manager : i would prefer both too .
industrial designer : you agree ?
project manager : .
industrial designer : ?
marketing executive : combine them .
industrial designer : that would bring the m some more costs , but the who cares , right . that is the project manager is problem .
user interface designer : buy a fifty cents battery and
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : fifty cent , why does not and then we have single - curved versus double - curved .
user interface designer : maybe i have something in my presentation to cope with that .
industrial designer : that no , we will just and , plastic versus rubber .
marketing executive : rubber .
project manager : rubber .
industrial designer : rubber ?
user interface designer : is not possible to make combination with rubber is or bendable remotes where you have got a .
industrial designer : you
user interface designer : or do you think it
industrial designer : i figured it will be m rather than hard
user interface designer : rubber casing , .
industrial designer : nah , rubber c this is a casing , . rubber casing ,
marketing executive : rather hard .
industrial designer : because if you use an d a touch - screen , it is just a casing around it . so , you could go for plastic , but i figured
user interface designer : d maybe ask it right now the question that i have .
industrial designer : i would choose rubber .
user interface designer : is it possible of is it necessary to make a touch - screen square ?
industrial designer : m i .
marketing executive : that touch - screens are generally square . but it is the case you put around it that makes the shape .
user interface designer : we are we put fashion in electronics ,
industrial designer : that is not
user interface designer : so maybe we can
marketing executive : ? , but if you have a square l_c_d _ screen , and you put a case around it that has like bulbs or that covers part of the l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer :  .
industrial designer : that would cover it .
marketing executive : that
industrial designer : that that would solve the problem .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : that is it is custom customisable and
industrial designer : so so what are the opinions ? rubber or plastic ? i prefer rubber .
marketing executive : me too .
project manager : me too .
industrial designer : you too ?
user interface designer : that is good .
industrial designer : you ? you you seemed to hesitate a bit .
user interface designer : as long a as long as it is firm , and you do not it is not bendable , i th that goes too far .
industrial designer : it should not flop over when you hold it in your hand no , that that is gonna the the chip set will hold it firm in place , and a l_c_d _ screen also
user interface designer : it might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor .
industrial designer : it m might it might . , tra traditional versus l_c_d _ , i figured we all set on that . and , then also the simple versus advanced . i figure if we go for l _ l_c_d _ , we should have the advanced . so that should not be a problem . , that is my , you are welcome .
marketing executive : can i do my thing ?
project manager : . do your thing , tim .
marketing executive : it
user interface designer : do your thing .
project manager : bring it on .
marketing executive : expert map . last week i went to paris and milan for some trend - watching . for marketing . our research and development department and i went to paris and milan . in paris and milan , we asked different people , differing in age and in income , the amount of money to spend , what they like in design and material nowadays . our main audience , so that is people below forty , prefer the following . at first , the colours of fruit . very basic colours , like janus explained . , fresh colours , green , red , strawberry red , yellow , banana yellow . , considering material , . they like spongy material ,
user interface designer : spongeball .
marketing executive : like a sponge - ball . like a s soft material . janus m mentioned it also . he did some findings himself .
industrial designer : the teletubbies sh
marketing executive : you wer you were not in paris ? like big g flashy colours .
project manager : flashy .
marketing executive : it is , . , our secondary audience , people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . , materials like wood that
project manager : but wood is not a material you which you build a remote control of .
industrial designer : you could . you you could .
marketing executive : no n j just a w
project manager : but never seen one .
user interface designer : it will float .
marketing executive : no , but just a wooden look .
project manager : case . , a wooden look , .
marketing executive : like you have those fake panels on the floor .
user interface designer : tables .
marketing executive : the that is not wood anyway , but but , that is our secondary audience . so , we decided to take the people below forty . so , that this does not apply . , there are some overall thoughts about new remote controls . they have to look fancy . , they should be technological in innovative . that means there have to be fancy things in . , and easy to use . but that is common . my personal preferences . we have to aim at a mu at the main audience . and , therefore use fresh colours .
project manager : would you prefer that you can choose the colour of your remote control or
marketing executive : i will come to that in a second point . here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . to customise your own remote control . like the nokia the removable covers , just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one . , a third , material being used could be like rubber . , two advantages . , it fits within the current market trends . and it adds safety to your remote when you drop it . so to come back to your question , and the people in milan and paris also think that the rubber should be pretty hard . like seen on regular mobile phones . actually , they have a lot in common . the phones and the
industrial designer : i actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so .
marketing executive : .
project manager : maybe you could use your remote as a phone .
user interface designer : hey .
industrial designer : hey .
project manager : there are numbers on it , so
industrial designer : that might be a next step .
marketing executive : exactly . , in my second sheet of personal preferences , we have to reconsider the speech function recognition . , it is very innovative .
project manager : so that you say s_p_s_s _ , and it goes to
marketing executive : like something . you you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak speech recognition and . but , we have to keep the cost in mind , but it
user interface designer : twelve fifty
marketing executive : it can be very expensive . , building games like snake or tetris to amuse the younger users . , also the link with mobile phones .
project manager : but you do not use that th games when you watching television , .
marketing executive : no , but no , . but you do not use games when you are d when you are making a telephone call . it is just the same .
user interface designer : when your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else .
project manager : .
marketing executive : when you are at college .
project manager : you take your remote control with you .
user interface designer : take it .
industrial designer : you take your remote with you to school .
marketing executive : no . you al you also take t you take your ipac and go play games . , i do that , but and third , i stick with it , the log - in functionality with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension .
user interface designer : . s
industrial designer : very .
marketing executive : that is it .
project manager : great .
user interface designer : in . the interface contents . that is a just simple powerpoint mock - up i want to m make it more as dynamic for you so i will draw there . but , the main concept is take one big touch screen . , always display the primary buttons clear and visible . maybe even li like this with u uses of a lot of space . and make the menu structure changeable . so if you press system , that is , m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or one , can fit in . or maybe even a step further when you want to t have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . and other buttons can may be displayed here if that is necessary . and , how do we want to look at f does a remote look , it is you have got ta hold it in one hand . so the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands . and some remotes you can use with your thumb . but that is too difficult for this one . so you can make it s a little broader . and maybe use your thumb on the main buttons . and use your other hands on the menu structure . so here are gonna be the program buttons . one , two , three , four , et cetera . and the volume control and program control maybe . and , down here , i added , this could be one big l_c_d _ . , the menu structure . so you can use it in this way . one thing you have got ta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . , know that if you are changing the menu structure here , and , i still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . but if you are programming the colour of the t_v _ , do not display twenty other options that are possible . just keep it as simple as possible . and do not use too many levels . do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un - plus , and push plus twenty times . but just the just in one button if possible . and , you kn you all know the t_v _ levels . , channel one , two . and when you get to n to ten , ye and want to go back , you have a problem . just m most modern t_v_s , you press one zero , and it goes to ten . and else , to one and through after that . so the s a button less . and , things like teletext , put them in the menu . things like
marketing executive : . , what do you think about a back - and - forth come - up button ?
user interface designer : w , i find i must trying to tell it .
marketing executive : l like in internet explorer .
user interface designer : is volume plus and minus ? and this is program plus and minus .
marketing executive : but does it that is for going from four to five .
user interface designer : yes .
marketing executive : but if you go from two to eight , and you want
user interface designer : or if you are watching studio sports on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two
marketing executive : and on two . that you can switch easy .
user interface designer : yes , that is a good idea . but , m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure .
marketing executive : it is .
user interface designer : and if you are using that button a lot of times , the menu will still be displayed on the screen . you just do not have to play games in - between . but if you are really switching between two channels , you wo not have time to d use the other options .
marketing executive : no .
user interface designer : already told that . that is my conclusion .
project manager : we can discuss a little about the three revolutionary things tim came with . the parental control , the games , and the voice recognition . there is n not too much decision on that one so that parental control is a good function to put in the remote . i how you think about it .
user interface designer : i agree , just put it in the menu structure somewhere . , system properties , parental control .
marketing executive : but what i see how i see it is you put it on the remote and then you have like a windows log - on screen with parents , children . something like that .
user interface designer : w , .
marketing executive : and w when you want to use the parents option , you have to
user interface designer : it it has to be fast . you do not want to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and twenty seconds for the log - on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings .
project manager : no but most people find it much more important that their children do not watch sex or violence on the television , and ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can finally watch it because of that .
user interface designer : why you c may use like when there is x_p _ , a simple log - on , d you just push one or two or three .
marketing executive : . pu push parents .
user interface designer : and if you push parents , then
marketing executive : that then you have to go to three - digit log - in .
user interface designer : . and if you puts a ye
marketing executive : like two one three .
user interface designer : and if you w you push p children , you do not have to log in , but you can only watch children is channels or
marketing executive : it automatically goes .
industrial designer : i if it is worth the time and effort we are going to spend on it . because it is a simple function , but it is gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time to programming it . because you will have to start working with the profiles and such . and i am not if it is actually worth investing that much time and effort into it .
project manager : that is a b there is a big market for it ,
industrial designer : i what
project manager : because you , you read many times in magazines same , and you heard on the news that he , they believe that children are influenced by the television ,
marketing executive : v violent t_v _ .
project manager : and , we are aiming to below forty years . but there are a lot of people will below forty who have children in young age who want to not watch violent or
user interface designer : maybe some idea on that . just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , if my grandad would buy this remote , he would not want to bother with all the things to do . just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles .
project manager : that is a that is a better idea ?
marketing executive : w it just has to be w when it is deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain . but if you want to install it personally if i got kids , and i could choose between two remote controls . one w with parent control and one without , and i would buy the one with .
project manager : with and one without .
user interface designer : b , still some question i have about how to incorporate those ones .
marketing executive : i th .
user interface designer : you are thinking about some channels they can not see , but , i when , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock in the evening violent films and movies will come and maybe some timing will be needed instead of channels , because if you are watching , i , you are in the at day , cartoons will come up m on maybe friday night .
project manager : maybe it can work with show view . , you can control your video recorder with show view . , when you tick in a number , it will start and end recording . but maybe there is some option that t the show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out .
user interface designer : the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show - view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all ,
project manager : .
user interface designer : will have to decide
marketing executive : but that is not possible .
user interface designer : that is not possible .
industrial designer : but , if you want to i i if we in incorporate the parental control , let is say we do , and whatever , cho child just goes up to the t_v _ and presses up . , nob nobody is stopping the child from checking the channel .
user interface designer : you could say if parental control is only it will go from fourteen to sixteen with the page - up then , but
industrial designer : but that , i am not because for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the remote control , so it would , have to be constant signalling . what m what may be better is to incorporate an a separate device that you can program with the remote control . and that provides parental control , . and that is just an optional device . so there is n that is there is besides the remote control , you will have a separate
project manager : i would not put it in an optional device . that that then it becomes too much , .
industrial designer : ?
project manager : if we do it , we must do it in a ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise .
user interface designer : on a separate menu option .
marketing executive : and and w when you install another device , children can still go up to the t_v _ , p pop open the thing and g
industrial designer : that is true . that is true ,
marketing executive : go to a channel .
industrial designer : but at same instant , same happens when you have remote control . so
marketing executive : but
industrial designer : but , only difference is the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control , and those people would not necessary want it .
marketing executive : it is
industrial designer : so , you would be
marketing executive : . but it is just an added feature .
project manager : . and what do you guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? i personally think that becomes too much .
user interface designer : i
project manager : it is more like it gets you to the functionality , but
user interface designer : a mail too from management that it is very popular to use voice recon recognition . but i do not think when you are watching t_v _ , hearing loud noises from the t_v _ , someone screaming one , and you f the channel switches , .
marketing executive : like f voice recognition is too much , . but
project manager : and games ?
marketing executive : games . it does not
industrial designer : . see games happening .
user interface designer : w you can put it on chip anyway , so
project manager : that would
user interface designer : as long as it is is not a primary feature of the remote ,
marketing executive : that that does not c that does not co
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : that does not cost a lot of extra resources , .
project manager : so that will that must be in it , you think ?
industrial designer : that will be .
project manager : . so the games are in it . the voice recognition are not . and the parental control are
user interface designer : optional in
project manager : optional ?
marketing executive : it is in it . but too ma so , but
user interface designer : but how we do it ? , also it is a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . so we should make it too complex . is t some menu function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on . but how it is gonna work will f be a problem .
project manager : but will there like the first idea from you can buy it without and with parental contr control ? or are we going to put it in and just
user interface designer : ye best would be to put it in and make it an menu option .
marketing executive : to put
user interface designer : you can put on
marketing executive : to put it in always .
user interface designer : and you can just s when you buy it , you can select personal preference , parental control on , and the password .
industrial designer : i . i figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with a receiver in it . so you could actually easily build in parental control . but it would be more expensive . so , a and that way you could make cheap model and a expensive model . could ma make the simple model and the deluxe model , .
user interface designer : it is a p .
marketing executive : but t_v_s are not capable of sending .
industrial designer : yes they are .
marketing executive : they were just
project manager : you yo
industrial designer : you have some t_v_s any
marketing executive : a able to receive . but
project manager : but most often not .
industrial designer : . that is true , that is true .
user interface designer : maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you can not watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you can not watch all channels after ten o'clock . and there is just some little clock in the remote .
industrial designer : you could easily to the mote control .
marketing executive : j just some rules .
industrial designer : but you still have the problem about the television itself .
user interface designer : no , no , it is very simple . there th i h i have seen some of remotes who have a clock in it . so , the remote does does not transmit when it is after twelve clock .
marketing executive : but , on the t_v _
user interface designer : ?
marketing executive : at least my t_v _ , is a compartment which you can press . and there are buttons behind it which you can use , if you d if you do not have a
user interface designer : that is to put it very blunt , that is not our problem . just have the parents buy some glue and it is not a part of the remote .
industrial designer : that is true .
user interface designer : you have to f .
industrial designer : you could go like
user interface designer : or make it ourselves very diffic
industrial designer : that would actually make things a lot more easy . you could just blame it on television and make it their problem . , i figured i figure we could do that . , i am not what marketing thinks about it , but
marketing executive : or j . i have to consult my legal advisor about it .
project manager : . so we have decided on the things that from janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic . the case will be double - curved and rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour that with cover is removable . the buttons will be touch - screen . but there may not be too many buttons . and in the menu structure , there must not to be five minutes to go . , too many levels . and it must be easy to use . the parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . and the games are in it . so we have decided , .
marketing executive : consensus .
project manager : little more .
marketing executive : . i have one thing left . maybe for jerome .
user interface designer : ? i am listening .
marketing executive : the views . maybe it is handy to build in an expert view and a simple view .
project manager : like a like a moat or s .
user interface designer :
industrial designer : user profile .
marketing executive : like at in the experts view , you have a lot of more buttons .
project manager : but you have that in the
user interface designer : what i was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you do not use it is simple .
project manager : you use the
user interface designer : and when you push system properties , entire list pops up with e ev all f you can program .
project manager : . it is already incorporated a little in that concept .
marketing executive : . fairly enough .
industrial designer : you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users .
marketing executive : wh which buttons you like or not .
industrial designer : which buttons do you want to in it . because you can like build in a back - forward button , and some po somebody would just want to watch two channels .
marketing executive : just leave the other numbers away .
industrial designer : you could m have people want that .
project manager : we take it to the other meeting , i have a little w little chat to do
industrial designer : .
project manager : and then we finish .
marketing executive : a little chat .
project manager : i went to a master class and two things are can come in handy for us . first thing is we talked about knowledge management . knowledge engineering and the fact that the idea of knowledge , sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is like that . it is it is very hot at the moment , so it is mostly for the management expert to look what other
marketing executive : marketing .
project manager : marketing or did i said management ?
marketing executive : management .
project manager : just talking about myself .
marketing executive : that is my function , to
project manager : w what other companies had to also with the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some . import export . and another one .
user interface designer : som some bench - marker .
project manager : they are a ha they are at , benchmarking , that is the word i saw . i could not , another thing is there were there was a survey , and it came out that people like to buy things from a single large provider , instead of those who are partnering with us . so , we must bring it as if real reaction is big company , a trustful company , and it has m
marketing executive : how i know a marketing name for our product . r _ th r _ to the third power . real reaction remote .
project manager : i had a i had another idea to put the whole idea of real reaction and a single brand and that thing .
marketing executive :  ?
project manager : when you put on remote , you see a just like when you telephone , you see a little animation .
user interface designer : logo .
marketing executive : bling .
project manager : real reaction remote . and with the motto , we put fashion in electronics . and then you go
marketing executive : but it has to be like a split second , because you have to put in a code also and
project manager : the
user interface designer : you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds , they will still remember it .
project manager : . but w th the idea from this thing is that we must present it as a as we are a single large provider who will stand on our own .
user interface designer : and it l linger on every time you see it .
industrial designer : if you have the l l_c_d _ screen , you can have a small logo i at the bottom . and it could just stay there .
marketing executive : that spins around like all the time .
project manager :
user interface designer : very annoying .
industrial designer : that spins around .
project manager : also also . but we are
marketing executive : it it is just like a globe in internet explorer .
project manager : y .
industrial designer : . , something like that .
project manager : but think about that things .
user interface designer : i it is for f
project manager : that is what they said in the master class .
user interface designer : for the next meeting , right ?
project manager : n , next meeting starts in thirty minutes .
marketing executive : who
project manager : so maybe you can go to paris and milan once again .
marketing executive : who who gave you the master class ?
project manager : the master class ?
marketing executive : ronald betenberg ?
project manager : franz mehler is . , very special , next session . idea that you the industrial development centre and user interface will work together on a prototype . and will drawing it on the smartboard . so that is a kinda new thing . and , the marketing expert will ke he will be keeping busy with the product evaluation . but the most specific instructions will be sent to you by email .
industrial designer : so we are going to work together right now ?
user interface designer : stay here and
project manager : the , dids this what i heard . i
marketing executive : in the master class .
project manager : not in the master class . so you just for the specific instructions and

project manager : cheers . see you in a half hour . but keep an eye on your laptops for a real
industrial designer : i am not if we because i saw something about individual actions .
project manager : but th there is still the my instructions that you will work together .
user interface designer : here ? or
project manager : that is not my problem .
user interface designer : . if you got a
project manager : bye - bye .
user interface designer : no . so stupid manager .
project manager : the project manager always works alone .
industrial designer : right . do you have new email ?
user interface designer : no .","the project manager went over the agenda . the industrial designer gave a presentation about the options for power source , materials and components . he recommended using kinetic energy , and having a double-curved rubber case . the group decided to combine batteries and kinetic energy . the marketing expert reported on current trends among young people for fresh fruity colours and spongy material . he explained that the remote should look fancy , and be technologically innovative and easy to use . he suggested using removable customisable covers , speech recognition , installing some games into the remote , and implementing a parental control feature . the user interface designer talked about having a simple layout with not many buttons . most features will be controlled through the menu . the group discussed the various options and decided to use games but not speech recognition . after a lot of discussion they decided to implement a simple parental control feature . the project manager talked about what he had learned at a masterclass on knowledge management . the group discussed how to incorporate the company logo and motto onto the remote , including having an animated logo on the touch screen . the project manager gave the group instructions about what to do before the next meeting . the industrial designer and user interface designer will work together on a prototype , using the smartboard . the marketing expert will work on the product evaluation . the energy source will be a combination of batteries and kinetic energy . the case will be double-curved and made of rubber , with fruity-coloured removable covers . there will be a touch screen and not many buttons . the remote will include games and a simple parental control feature . it will not use speech recognition . the user interface designer had problems with his laptop while he was preparing his presentation . the group were unsure about how to implement a parental control feature , or if it would be worth the time and money .
","the project manager opened the meeting and had the industrial designer and user interface designer present their conceptual designs for the remote control . the marketing expert discussed the target group for the remote: young people between the ages of twelve and thirty-five . the industrial designer discussed the options for batteries , shapes and materials to use for the case , and features to include such as a lock function , scroll wheels for controlling multiple devices , and lcd screens for controlling televisions and gaming consoles . the user interface designer presented two existing remote control designs to the group , showing how they differed in appearance , functionality , and usability . the marketing expert then led the group in a brainstorming session about features to include in the remote control design . the group decided on what materials and shapes to use , how many buttons to have , and the color of the remote . the industrial designer and user interface designer will work on a prototype evaluation . the marketing expert will work on a prototype evaluation . the industrial designer and user interface designer worked together on a drawing of the remote control prototype . the industrial designer and user interface designer will work on a prototype evaluation . the marketing expert will work on a prototype evaluation . the remote will have a locking function . the remote will have a scroll wheel for controlling multiple devices . the lcd screen will be covered in a soft material . the remote will have a locking function . the remote will have a recharging stand . the case will be made of rubber . the remote will have a locking function",x,x,,x,,,,,7.0,Pegasus-Baseline

user interface designer : hello .
industrial designer : hi .
marketing executive : hey , project manager .
user interface designer : project manager , i have something to tell you . i have a little problems with my laptop . and s so i had a little less time to complete . no , a little problem , big problem . thought
marketing executive : what was it , problem ?
user interface designer : it did not work anymore .
marketing executive : the laptop ?
user interface designer : the entire windows
marketing executive : it hang hung .
user interface designer : it it hung .
marketing executive : ha - ha . project manager .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : you are our project manager .
project manager : your project manager . welcome to the conceptual design meeting for real reaction . , hello again . it is the same as the last time . , also this time there will be three presentations . and we must reach a decision on the remote control concepts . , and at the end , i , when i finish it off i have some input from a master class i visited .
user interface designer : during lunch , .
marketing executive : master .
user interface designer : he is the master , .
project manager : the the concepts on we where we must reach a decision on . , our from are of two sorts .
marketing executive : master of
project manager : components concepts and user interface concepts . , the first one is really about the total package with , we have decided to do a do the with a touch - screen that must be a case around it so it wo not be as breakable . how about the energy ? can you can you reload it or just have batteries which you must exchange ? , the user interface concept . , with the type and the supplements . so where to put what button . and i would say jans , can you begin ?
industrial designer : .
project manager : at the end , i will take notes and at the end of the minutes will be at the shared folder .
industrial designer : let me see . it is this one . , i will be talking about the components . , what i did was i reviewed previously used items by two different age groups .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : below forty five and above . and watch what the differences are and i checked , what d do we want , and how can we d aim a at the target group . what i found was that a senior citizens
marketing executive : i am .
industrial designer : ye , it is .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : they , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and such more . wood and chrome . and they like straightforward shapes . , they like luxurious styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more soft materials . think of the teletubbies , . , soft and fluffy and colourful and , shapes are curved and round . y y you get the picture . and they like sports and gaming , and that gives them the vitality . , so w , firs
project manager : one one little question .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : about the material . a soft material for a remote control ?
industrial designer : no , i will get to that .
project manager : .
industrial designer : you you will see . , f first off , let is start with the energy . w i had a choice between a few different sources . but the two basic sources that i found were the best possible were the battery versus kinetic . kinetic , that is when you move something , then it gets energy . i figured , that is ki kinda high - tech , when you have a remote control that , when you pick it up , it has power . that would be actually very , i figured . , we could also use a battery , that is a bit
marketing executive : but when the power gets low , you have to shake it ?
industrial designer : . , you c just you have to shake it around a little bit .
marketing executive : and
industrial designer : and then it d then it has some more energy . , y you could just go for a battery . or you can go for both ?
user interface designer : have you considered the option of using a solar panel ?
industrial designer : i actually did . but about solar panel is you have to have l light . , sunlight preferably .
user interface designer : w nah .
industrial designer : and you could use normal light , but you would not get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery . for ultimate b n use of solar panels , you could actually use you could use solar panels , but you ha you would have to implement them into the remote control , leaving you a bit less space for the interface .
marketing executive : . it is too less space .
industrial designer : so so i it wo what is actually i c just in f i have figured it out that , seeing that you will always be within the l distance of t_v _ , and the from t_v _ there comes a whole bunch of light . so it would actually power itself from a t_v _ . but , you just take up all the space , and you would not have the full amount of power actually used .
project manager : but you prefer kinetic ?
industrial designer : i prefer kinetic because it is , the costs are not that much higher , and , ju just a bit more high - tech than a normal battery .
project manager : but you do not move a remote control too much .
industrial designer : if no , but d , you pick it up and you press buttons and y , you
project manager : and that is enough to keep the energy level
industrial designer : actually it is . and it if it is not , you just shake it a bit and add with power up again . but , what l what jarek said , you could use a battery that you would just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . and for rest , you would just add juice on the battery .
marketing executive : and when the battery does not work , i usually shake it too . so
project manager : tim .
industrial designer : exactly .
marketing executive : like slamming on it . it is exactly the same .
industrial designer : and so that , f furthermore , you we checked the cases . we have different options concerning the cases . you ha i you sim you simply add a basic standard model it was square and i figured that is a bit boring . so you we could go for the single curved or the double curved . , single curve , it is just a , , it is just a curve . or but you could go in a in an double curves . and that is like several different dimensions . that gives you an whole new effec
project manager : dynamic dynamic look ?
industrial designer : that gives you a younger and more high - tech look , i f i figured . but , that we will discuss later .
marketing executive : but , are you going to draw it ?
industrial designer : what ?
user interface designer : th th .
industrial designer : you want me to draw in three - d _ ?
marketing executive : the , i c i ca not imagine .
industrial designer : i ca i could show you .
marketing executive : i ca not imagine how it looks like .
industrial designer : let is say y you let is say that is your standard
marketing executive : design .
industrial designer : that is a bit your d standard design . but you could actually go like something like this .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : and then in three - d _ effect you could go so y you just , this is a this bit difficulty in i did not take a major in art . so but but you could have a whole new the back the depth , you could just play around a bit with .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : you you do not have to use standard
project manager : a little artistic .
industrial designer : you could y it leaves more space for creativity . that might be an idea , but just a , furthermore , plastic versus rubber ? you we could choose what is better , plastic or rubber . i ch prefer rubber because it feels .
project manager : it is soft .
industrial designer : it is soft and it is that i like soft .
project manager : that is the material the younger people want , ai not it ?
industrial designer : plastic is plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , like plastic your your i usually associate plastic with something that is cheap . that is maybe just me , but , we could , talk about it later . furthermore , buttons . traditional or a touch screen . , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so i figured i will just leave it at the l_c_d _ . and chip set , if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go with a simple chip set . but if we decide to go on a n l_c_d _ screen , we would use an we have to use an a advanced chip set . and that would bring the necessary costs with it . so that is something we th have to keep in mind . if it is not manageable budget - wise , we would have to go over to sim to simple buttons .
marketing executive : we are going to sell tell ten millions of them . so i bet a big company in korea or taiwan , like samsung , can give us a big discount on the chips , so
industrial designer : probably .
marketing executive : u usually , chips are are not more expensive than one dollar .
industrial designer : probably , but but , that is
marketing executive : so that that should not be a real issue , .
industrial designer : that should not be that big a issue . i will just add , i put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit . what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ?
user interface designer : you should use kinetic as a back - up .
industrial designer : you should we should
marketing executive : a combination .
user interface designer : a combination , .
industrial designer : a combination . , you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . when you pick it up , it charges up .
marketing executive : like an aku acu , .
industrial designer : i know .
user interface designer : .
project manager : just like the watch from seiko .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : psycho - kinetic .
industrial designer : i con exactly . what what do you think ?
project manager : i would prefer both too .
industrial designer : you agree ?
project manager : .
industrial designer : ?
marketing executive : combine them .
industrial designer : that would bring the m some more costs , but the who cares , right . that is the project manager is problem .
user interface designer : buy a fifty cents battery and
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : fifty cent , why does not and then we have single - curved versus double - curved .
user interface designer : maybe i have something in my presentation to cope with that .
industrial designer : that no , we will just and , plastic versus rubber .
marketing executive : rubber .
project manager : rubber .
industrial designer : rubber ?
user interface designer : is not possible to make combination with rubber is or bendable remotes where you have got a .
industrial designer : you
user interface designer : or do you think it
industrial designer : i figured it will be m rather than hard
user interface designer : rubber casing , .
industrial designer : nah , rubber c this is a casing , . rubber casing ,
marketing executive : rather hard .
industrial designer : because if you use an d a touch - screen , it is just a casing around it . so , you could go for plastic , but i figured
user interface designer : d maybe ask it right now the question that i have .
industrial designer : i would choose rubber .
user interface designer : is it possible of is it necessary to make a touch - screen square ?
industrial designer : m i .
marketing executive : that touch - screens are generally square . but it is the case you put around it that makes the shape .
user interface designer : we are we put fashion in electronics ,
industrial designer : that is not
user interface designer : so maybe we can
marketing executive : ? , but if you have a square l_c_d _ screen , and you put a case around it that has like bulbs or that covers part of the l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer :  .
industrial designer : that would cover it .
marketing executive : that
industrial designer : that that would solve the problem .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : that is it is custom customisable and
industrial designer : so so what are the opinions ? rubber or plastic ? i prefer rubber .
marketing executive : me too .
project manager : me too .
industrial designer : you too ?
user interface designer : that is good .
industrial designer : you ? you you seemed to hesitate a bit .
user interface designer : as long a as long as it is firm , and you do not it is not bendable , i th that goes too far .
industrial designer : it should not flop over when you hold it in your hand no , that that is gonna the the chip set will hold it firm in place , and a l_c_d _ screen also
user interface designer : it might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor .
industrial designer : it m might it might . , tra traditional versus l_c_d _ , i figured we all set on that . and , then also the simple versus advanced . i figure if we go for l _ l_c_d _ , we should have the advanced . so that should not be a problem . , that is my , you are welcome .
marketing executive : can i do my thing ?
project manager : . do your thing , tim .
marketing executive : it
user interface designer : do your thing .
project manager : bring it on .
marketing executive : expert map . last week i went to paris and milan for some trend - watching . for marketing . our research and development department and i went to paris and milan . in paris and milan , we asked different people , differing in age and in income , the amount of money to spend , what they like in design and material nowadays . our main audience , so that is people below forty , prefer the following . at first , the colours of fruit . very basic colours , like janus explained . , fresh colours , green , red , strawberry red , yellow , banana yellow . , considering material , . they like spongy material ,
user interface designer : spongeball .
marketing executive : like a sponge - ball . like a s soft material . janus m mentioned it also . he did some findings himself .
industrial designer : the teletubbies sh
marketing executive : you wer you were not in paris ? like big g flashy colours .
project manager : flashy .
marketing executive : it is , . , our secondary audience , people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . , materials like wood that
project manager : but wood is not a material you which you build a remote control of .
industrial designer : you could . you you could .
marketing executive : no n j just a w
project manager : but never seen one .
user interface designer : it will float .
marketing executive : no , but just a wooden look .
project manager : case . , a wooden look , .
marketing executive : like you have those fake panels on the floor .
user interface designer : tables .
marketing executive : the that is not wood anyway , but but , that is our secondary audience . so , we decided to take the people below forty . so , that this does not apply . , there are some overall thoughts about new remote controls . they have to look fancy . , they should be technological in innovative . that means there have to be fancy things in . , and easy to use . but that is common . my personal preferences . we have to aim at a mu at the main audience . and , therefore use fresh colours .
project manager : would you prefer that you can choose the colour of your remote control or
marketing executive : i will come to that in a second point . here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . to customise your own remote control . like the nokia the removable covers , just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one . , a third , material being used could be like rubber . , two advantages . , it fits within the current market trends . and it adds safety to your remote when you drop it . so to come back to your question , and the people in milan and paris also think that the rubber should be pretty hard . like seen on regular mobile phones . actually , they have a lot in common . the phones and the
industrial designer : i actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so .
marketing executive : .
project manager : maybe you could use your remote as a phone .
user interface designer : hey .
industrial designer : hey .
project manager : there are numbers on it , so
industrial designer : that might be a next step .
marketing executive : exactly . , in my second sheet of personal preferences , we have to reconsider the speech function recognition . , it is very innovative .
project manager : so that you say s_p_s_s _ , and it goes to
marketing executive : like something . you you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak speech recognition and . but , we have to keep the cost in mind , but it
user interface designer : twelve fifty
marketing executive : it can be very expensive . , building games like snake or tetris to amuse the younger users . , also the link with mobile phones .
project manager : but you do not use that th games when you watching television , .
marketing executive : no , but no , . but you do not use games when you are d when you are making a telephone call . it is just the same .
user interface designer : when your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else .
project manager : .
marketing executive : when you are at college .
project manager : you take your remote control with you .
user interface designer : take it .
industrial designer : you take your remote with you to school .
marketing executive : no . you al you also take t you take your ipac and go play games . , i do that , but and third , i stick with it , the log - in functionality with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension .
user interface designer : . s
industrial designer : very .
marketing executive : that is it .
project manager : great .
user interface designer : in . the interface contents . that is a just simple powerpoint mock - up i want to m make it more as dynamic for you so i will draw there . but , the main concept is take one big touch screen . , always display the primary buttons clear and visible . maybe even li like this with u uses of a lot of space . and make the menu structure changeable . so if you press system , that is , m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or one , can fit in . or maybe even a step further when you want to t have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . and other buttons can may be displayed here if that is necessary . and , how do we want to look at f does a remote look , it is you have got ta hold it in one hand . so the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands . and some remotes you can use with your thumb . but that is too difficult for this one . so you can make it s a little broader . and maybe use your thumb on the main buttons . and use your other hands on the menu structure . so here are gonna be the program buttons . one , two , three , four , et cetera . and the volume control and program control maybe . and , down here , i added , this could be one big l_c_d _ . , the menu structure . so you can use it in this way . one thing you have got ta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . , know that if you are changing the menu structure here , and , i still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . but if you are programming the colour of the t_v _ , do not display twenty other options that are possible . just keep it as simple as possible . and do not use too many levels . do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un - plus , and push plus twenty times . but just the just in one button if possible . and , you kn you all know the t_v _ levels . , channel one , two . and when you get to n to ten , ye and want to go back , you have a problem . just m most modern t_v_s , you press one zero , and it goes to ten . and else , to one and through after that . so the s a button less . and , things like teletext , put them in the menu . things like
marketing executive : . , what do you think about a back - and - forth come - up button ?
user interface designer : w , i find i must trying to tell it .
marketing executive : l like in internet explorer .
user interface designer : is volume plus and minus ? and this is program plus and minus .
marketing executive : but does it that is for going from four to five .
user interface designer : yes .
marketing executive : but if you go from two to eight , and you want
user interface designer : or if you are watching studio sports on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two
marketing executive : and on two . that you can switch easy .
user interface designer : yes , that is a good idea . but , m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure .
marketing executive : it is .
user interface designer : and if you are using that button a lot of times , the menu will still be displayed on the screen . you just do not have to play games in - between . but if you are really switching between two channels , you wo not have time to d use the other options .
marketing executive : no .
user interface designer : already told that . that is my conclusion .
project manager : we can discuss a little about the three revolutionary things tim came with . the parental control , the games , and the voice recognition . there is n not too much decision on that one so that parental control is a good function to put in the remote . i how you think about it .
user interface designer : i agree , just put it in the menu structure somewhere . , system properties , parental control .
marketing executive : but what i see how i see it is you put it on the remote and then you have like a windows log - on screen with parents , children . something like that .
user interface designer : w , .
marketing executive : and w when you want to use the parents option , you have to
user interface designer : it it has to be fast . you do not want to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and twenty seconds for the log - on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings .
project manager : no but most people find it much more important that their children do not watch sex or violence on the television , and ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can finally watch it because of that .
user interface designer : why you c may use like when there is x_p _ , a simple log - on , d you just push one or two or three .
marketing executive : . pu push parents .
user interface designer : and if you push parents , then
marketing executive : that then you have to go to three - digit log - in .
user interface designer : . and if you puts a ye
marketing executive : like two one three .
user interface designer : and if you w you push p children , you do not have to log in , but you can only watch children is channels or
marketing executive : it automatically goes .
industrial designer : i if it is worth the time and effort we are going to spend on it . because it is a simple function , but it is gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time to programming it . because you will have to start working with the profiles and such . and i am not if it is actually worth investing that much time and effort into it .
project manager : that is a b there is a big market for it ,
industrial designer : i what
project manager : because you , you read many times in magazines same , and you heard on the news that he , they believe that children are influenced by the television ,
marketing executive : v violent t_v _ .
project manager : and , we are aiming to below forty years . but there are a lot of people will below forty who have children in young age who want to not watch violent or
user interface designer : maybe some idea on that . just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , if my grandad would buy this remote , he would not want to bother with all the things to do . just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles .
project manager : that is a that is a better idea ?
marketing executive : w it just has to be w when it is deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain . but if you want to install it personally if i got kids , and i could choose between two remote controls . one w with parent control and one without , and i would buy the one with .
project manager : with and one without .
user interface designer : b , still some question i have about how to incorporate those ones .
marketing executive : i th .
user interface designer : you are thinking about some channels they can not see , but , i when , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock in the evening violent films and movies will come and maybe some timing will be needed instead of channels , because if you are watching , i , you are in the at day , cartoons will come up m on maybe friday night .
project manager : maybe it can work with show view . , you can control your video recorder with show view . , when you tick in a number , it will start and end recording . but maybe there is some option that t the show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out .
user interface designer : the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show - view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all ,
project manager : .
user interface designer : will have to decide
marketing executive : but that is not possible .
user interface designer : that is not possible .
industrial designer : but , if you want to i i if we in incorporate the parental control , let is say we do , and whatever , cho child just goes up to the t_v _ and presses up . , nob nobody is stopping the child from checking the channel .
user interface designer : you could say if parental control is only it will go from fourteen to sixteen with the page - up then , but
industrial designer : but that , i am not because for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the remote control , so it would , have to be constant signalling . what m what may be better is to incorporate an a separate device that you can program with the remote control . and that provides parental control , . and that is just an optional device . so there is n that is there is besides the remote control , you will have a separate
project manager : i would not put it in an optional device . that that then it becomes too much , .
industrial designer : ?
project manager : if we do it , we must do it in a ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise .
user interface designer : on a separate menu option .
marketing executive : and and w when you install another device , children can still go up to the t_v _ , p pop open the thing and g
industrial designer : that is true . that is true ,
marketing executive : go to a channel .
industrial designer : but at same instant , same happens when you have remote control . so
marketing executive : but
industrial designer : but , only difference is the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control , and those people would not necessary want it .
marketing executive : it is
industrial designer : so , you would be
marketing executive : . but it is just an added feature .
project manager : . and what do you guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? i personally think that becomes too much .
user interface designer : i
project manager : it is more like it gets you to the functionality , but
user interface designer : a mail too from management that it is very popular to use voice recon recognition . but i do not think when you are watching t_v _ , hearing loud noises from the t_v _ , someone screaming one , and you f the channel switches , .
marketing executive : like f voice recognition is too much , . but
project manager : and games ?
marketing executive : games . it does not
industrial designer : . see games happening .
user interface designer : w you can put it on chip anyway , so
project manager : that would
user interface designer : as long as it is is not a primary feature of the remote ,
marketing executive : that that does not c that does not co
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : that does not cost a lot of extra resources , .
project manager : so that will that must be in it , you think ?
industrial designer : that will be .
project manager : . so the games are in it . the voice recognition are not . and the parental control are
user interface designer : optional in
project manager : optional ?
marketing executive : it is in it . but too ma so , but
user interface designer : but how we do it ? , also it is a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . so we should make it too complex . is t some menu function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on . but how it is gonna work will f be a problem .
project manager : but will there like the first idea from you can buy it without and with parental contr control ? or are we going to put it in and just
user interface designer : ye best would be to put it in and make it an menu option .
marketing executive : to put
user interface designer : you can put on
marketing executive : to put it in always .
user interface designer : and you can just s when you buy it , you can select personal preference , parental control on , and the password .
industrial designer : i . i figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with a receiver in it . so you could actually easily build in parental control . but it would be more expensive . so , a and that way you could make cheap model and a expensive model . could ma make the simple model and the deluxe model , .
user interface designer : it is a p .
marketing executive : but t_v_s are not capable of sending .
industrial designer : yes they are .
marketing executive : they were just
project manager : you yo
industrial designer : you have some t_v_s any
marketing executive : a able to receive . but
project manager : but most often not .
industrial designer : . that is true , that is true .
user interface designer : maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you can not watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you can not watch all channels after ten o'clock . and there is just some little clock in the remote .
industrial designer : you could easily to the mote control .
marketing executive : j just some rules .
industrial designer : but you still have the problem about the television itself .
user interface designer : no , no , it is very simple . there th i h i have seen some of remotes who have a clock in it . so , the remote does does not transmit when it is after twelve clock .
marketing executive : but , on the t_v _
user interface designer : ?
marketing executive : at least my t_v _ , is a compartment which you can press . and there are buttons behind it which you can use , if you d if you do not have a
user interface designer : that is to put it very blunt , that is not our problem . just have the parents buy some glue and it is not a part of the remote .
industrial designer : that is true .
user interface designer : you have to f .
industrial designer : you could go like
user interface designer : or make it ourselves very diffic
industrial designer : that would actually make things a lot more easy . you could just blame it on television and make it their problem . , i figured i figure we could do that . , i am not what marketing thinks about it , but
marketing executive : or j . i have to consult my legal advisor about it .
project manager : . so we have decided on the things that from janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic . the case will be double - curved and rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour that with cover is removable . the buttons will be touch - screen . but there may not be too many buttons . and in the menu structure , there must not to be five minutes to go . , too many levels . and it must be easy to use . the parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . and the games are in it . so we have decided , .
marketing executive : consensus .
project manager : little more .
marketing executive : . i have one thing left . maybe for jerome .
user interface designer : ? i am listening .
marketing executive : the views . maybe it is handy to build in an expert view and a simple view .
project manager : like a like a moat or s .
user interface designer :
industrial designer : user profile .
marketing executive : like at in the experts view , you have a lot of more buttons .
project manager : but you have that in the
user interface designer : what i was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you do not use it is simple .
project manager : you use the
user interface designer : and when you push system properties , entire list pops up with e ev all f you can program .
project manager : . it is already incorporated a little in that concept .
marketing executive : . fairly enough .
industrial designer : you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users .
marketing executive : wh which buttons you like or not .
industrial designer : which buttons do you want to in it . because you can like build in a back - forward button , and some po somebody would just want to watch two channels .
marketing executive : just leave the other numbers away .
industrial designer : you could m have people want that .
project manager : we take it to the other meeting , i have a little w little chat to do
industrial designer : .
project manager : and then we finish .
marketing executive : a little chat .
project manager : i went to a master class and two things are can come in handy for us . first thing is we talked about knowledge management . knowledge engineering and the fact that the idea of knowledge , sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is like that . it is it is very hot at the moment , so it is mostly for the management expert to look what other
marketing executive : marketing .
project manager : marketing or did i said management ?
marketing executive : management .
project manager : just talking about myself .
marketing executive : that is my function , to
project manager : w what other companies had to also with the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some . import export . and another one .
user interface designer : som some bench - marker .
project manager : they are a ha they are at , benchmarking , that is the word i saw . i could not , another thing is there were there was a survey , and it came out that people like to buy things from a single large provider , instead of those who are partnering with us . so , we must bring it as if real reaction is big company , a trustful company , and it has m
marketing executive : how i know a marketing name for our product . r _ th r _ to the third power . real reaction remote .
project manager : i had a i had another idea to put the whole idea of real reaction and a single brand and that thing .
marketing executive :  ?
project manager : when you put on remote , you see a just like when you telephone , you see a little animation .
user interface designer : logo .
marketing executive : bling .
project manager : real reaction remote . and with the motto , we put fashion in electronics . and then you go
marketing executive : but it has to be like a split second , because you have to put in a code also and
project manager : the
user interface designer : you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds , they will still remember it .
project manager : . but w th the idea from this thing is that we must present it as a as we are a single large provider who will stand on our own .
user interface designer : and it l linger on every time you see it .
industrial designer : if you have the l l_c_d _ screen , you can have a small logo i at the bottom . and it could just stay there .
marketing executive : that spins around like all the time .
project manager :
user interface designer : very annoying .
industrial designer : that spins around .
project manager : also also . but we are
marketing executive : it it is just like a globe in internet explorer .
project manager : y .
industrial designer : . , something like that .
project manager : but think about that things .
user interface designer : i it is for f
project manager : that is what they said in the master class .
user interface designer : for the next meeting , right ?
project manager : n , next meeting starts in thirty minutes .
marketing executive : who
project manager : so maybe you can go to paris and milan once again .
marketing executive : who who gave you the master class ?
project manager : the master class ?
marketing executive : ronald betenberg ?
project manager : franz mehler is . , very special , next session . idea that you the industrial development centre and user interface will work together on a prototype . and will drawing it on the smartboard . so that is a kinda new thing . and , the marketing expert will ke he will be keeping busy with the product evaluation . but the most specific instructions will be sent to you by email .
industrial designer : so we are going to work together right now ?
user interface designer : stay here and
project manager : the , dids this what i heard . i
marketing executive : in the master class .
project manager : not in the master class . so you just for the specific instructions and

industrial designer : i am not if we because i saw something about individual actions .
project manager : but th there is still the my instructions that you will work together .
user interface designer : here ? or
project manager : that is not my problem .
user interface designer : . if you got a
project manager : bye - bye .
user interface designer : no . so stupid manager .
project manager : the project manager always works alone .
industrial designer : right . do you have new email ?
user interface designer : no .","the project manager went over the agenda . the industrial designer gave a presentation about the options for power source , materials and components . he recommended using kinetic energy , and having a double-curved rubber case . the group decided to combine batteries and kinetic energy . the marketing expert reported on current trends among young people for fresh fruity colours and spongy material . he explained that the remote should look fancy , and be technologically innovative and easy to use . he suggested using removable customisable covers , speech recognition , installing some games into the remote , and implementing a parental control feature . the user interface designer talked about having a simple layout with not many buttons . most features will be controlled through the menu . the group discussed the various options and decided to use games but not speech recognition . after a lot of discussion they decided to implement a simple parental control feature . the project manager talked about what he had learned at a masterclass on knowledge management . the group discussed how to incorporate the company logo and motto onto the remote , including having an animated logo on the touch screen . the project manager gave the group instructions about what to do before the next meeting . the industrial designer and user interface designer will work together on a prototype , using the smartboard . the marketing expert will work on the product evaluation . the energy source will be a combination of batteries and kinetic energy . the case will be double-curved and made of rubber , with fruity-coloured removable covers . there will be a touch screen and not many buttons . the remote will include games and a simple parental control feature . it will not use speech recognition . the user interface designer had problems with his laptop while he was preparing his presentation . the group were unsure about how to implement a parental control feature , or if it would be worth the time and money .

user interface designer : hello .
industrial designer : hi .
marketing executive : hey , project manager .
user interface designer : project manager , i have something to tell you . i have a little problems with my laptop . and s so i had a little less time to complete . no , a little problem , big problem . thought
marketing executive : what was it , problem ?
user interface designer : it did not work anymore .
marketing executive : the laptop ?
user interface designer : the entire windows
marketing executive : it hang hung .
user interface designer : it it hung .
marketing executive : ha - ha . project manager .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : you are our project manager .
project manager : your project manager . welcome to the conceptual design meeting for real reaction . , hello again . it is the same as the last time . , also this time there will be three presentations . and we must reach a decision on the remote control concepts . , and at the end , i , when i finish it off i have some input from a master class i visited .
user interface designer : during lunch , .
marketing executive : master .
user interface designer : he is the master , .
project manager : the the concepts on we where we must reach a decision on . , our from are of two sorts .
marketing executive : master of
project manager : components concepts and user interface concepts . , the first one is really about the total package with , we have decided to do a do the with a touch - screen that must be a case around it so it wo not be as breakable . how about the energy ? can you can you reload it or just have batteries which you must exchange ? , the user interface concept . , with the type and the supplements . so where to put what button . and i would say jans , can you begin ?
industrial designer : .
project manager : at the end , i will take notes and at the end of the minutes will be at the shared folder .
industrial designer : let me see . it is this one . , i will be talking about the components . , what i did was i reviewed previously used items by two different age groups .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : below forty five and above . and watch what the differences are and i checked , what d do we want , and how can we d aim a at the target group . what i found was that a senior citizens
marketing executive : i am .
industrial designer : ye , it is .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : they , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and such more . wood and chrome . and they like straightforward shapes . , they like luxurious styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more soft materials . think of the teletubbies , . , soft and fluffy and colourful and , shapes are curved and round . y y you get the picture . and they like sports and gaming , and that gives them the vitality . , so w , firs
project manager : one one little question .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : about the material . a soft material for a remote control ?
industrial designer : no , i will get to that .
project manager : .
industrial designer : you you will see . , f first off , let is start with the energy . w i had a choice between a few different sources . but the two basic sources that i found were the best possible were the battery versus kinetic . kinetic , that is when you move something , then it gets energy . i figured , that is ki kinda high - tech , when you have a remote control that , when you pick it up , it has power . that would be actually very , i figured . , we could also use a battery , that is a bit
marketing executive : but when the power gets low , you have to shake it ?
industrial designer : . , you c just you have to shake it around a little bit .
marketing executive : and
industrial designer : and then it d then it has some more energy . , y you could just go for a battery . or you can go for both ?
user interface designer : have you considered the option of using a solar panel ?
industrial designer : i actually did . but about solar panel is you have to have l light . , sunlight preferably .
user interface designer : w nah .
industrial designer : and you could use normal light , but you would not get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery . for ultimate b n use of solar panels , you could actually use you could use solar panels , but you ha you would have to implement them into the remote control , leaving you a bit less space for the interface .
marketing executive : . it is too less space .
industrial designer : so so i it wo what is actually i c just in f i have figured it out that , seeing that you will always be within the l distance of t_v _ , and the from t_v _ there comes a whole bunch of light . so it would actually power itself from a t_v _ . but , you just take up all the space , and you would not have the full amount of power actually used .
project manager : but you prefer kinetic ?
industrial designer : i prefer kinetic because it is , the costs are not that much higher , and , ju just a bit more high - tech than a normal battery .
project manager : but you do not move a remote control too much .
industrial designer : if no , but d , you pick it up and you press buttons and y , you
project manager : and that is enough to keep the energy level
industrial designer : actually it is . and it if it is not , you just shake it a bit and add with power up again . but , what l what jarek said , you could use a battery that you would just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . and for rest , you would just add juice on the battery .
marketing executive : and when the battery does not work , i usually shake it too . so
project manager : tim .
industrial designer : exactly .
marketing executive : like slamming on it . it is exactly the same .
industrial designer : and so that , f furthermore , you we checked the cases . we have different options concerning the cases . you ha i you sim you simply add a basic standard model it was square and i figured that is a bit boring . so you we could go for the single curved or the double curved . , single curve , it is just a , , it is just a curve . or but you could go in a in an double curves . and that is like several different dimensions . that gives you an whole new effec
project manager : dynamic dynamic look ?
industrial designer : that gives you a younger and more high - tech look , i f i figured . but , that we will discuss later .
marketing executive : but , are you going to draw it ?
industrial designer : what ?
user interface designer : th th .
industrial designer : you want me to draw in three - d _ ?
marketing executive : the , i c i ca not imagine .
industrial designer : i ca i could show you .
marketing executive : i ca not imagine how it looks like .
industrial designer : let is say y you let is say that is your standard
marketing executive : design .
industrial designer : that is a bit your d standard design . but you could actually go like something like this .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : and then in three - d _ effect you could go so y you just , this is a this bit difficulty in i did not take a major in art . so but but you could have a whole new the back the depth , you could just play around a bit with .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : you you do not have to use standard
project manager : a little artistic .
industrial designer : you could y it leaves more space for creativity . that might be an idea , but just a , furthermore , plastic versus rubber ? you we could choose what is better , plastic or rubber . i ch prefer rubber because it feels .
project manager : it is soft .
industrial designer : it is soft and it is that i like soft .
project manager : that is the material the younger people want , ai not it ?
industrial designer : plastic is plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , like plastic your your i usually associate plastic with something that is cheap . that is maybe just me , but , we could , talk about it later . furthermore , buttons . traditional or a touch screen . , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so i figured i will just leave it at the l_c_d _ . and chip set , if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go with a simple chip set . but if we decide to go on a n l_c_d _ screen , we would use an we have to use an a advanced chip set . and that would bring the necessary costs with it . so that is something we th have to keep in mind . if it is not manageable budget - wise , we would have to go over to sim to simple buttons .
marketing executive : we are going to sell tell ten millions of them . so i bet a big company in korea or taiwan , like samsung , can give us a big discount on the chips , so
industrial designer : probably .
marketing executive : u usually , chips are are not more expensive than one dollar .
industrial designer : probably , but but , that is
marketing executive : so that that should not be a real issue , .
industrial designer : that should not be that big a issue . i will just add , i put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit . what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ?
user interface designer : you should use kinetic as a back - up .
industrial designer : you should we should
marketing executive : a combination .
user interface designer : a combination , .
industrial designer : a combination . , you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . when you pick it up , it charges up .
marketing executive : like an aku acu , .
industrial designer : i know .
user interface designer : .
project manager : just like the watch from seiko .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : psycho - kinetic .
industrial designer : i con exactly . what what do you think ?
project manager : i would prefer both too .
industrial designer : you agree ?
project manager : .
industrial designer : ?
marketing executive : combine them .
industrial designer : that would bring the m some more costs , but the who cares , right . that is the project manager is problem .
user interface designer : buy a fifty cents battery and
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : fifty cent , why does not and then we have single - curved versus double - curved .
user interface designer : maybe i have something in my presentation to cope with that .
industrial designer : that no , we will just and , plastic versus rubber .
marketing executive : rubber .
project manager : rubber .
industrial designer : rubber ?
user interface designer : is not possible to make combination with rubber is or bendable remotes where you have got a .
industrial designer : you
user interface designer : or do you think it
industrial designer : i figured it will be m rather than hard
user interface designer : rubber casing , .
industrial designer : nah , rubber c this is a casing , . rubber casing ,
marketing executive : rather hard .
industrial designer : because if you use an d a touch - screen , it is just a casing around it . so , you could go for plastic , but i figured
user interface designer : d maybe ask it right now the question that i have .
industrial designer : i would choose rubber .
user interface designer : is it possible of is it necessary to make a touch - screen square ?
industrial designer : m i .
marketing executive : that touch - screens are generally square . but it is the case you put around it that makes the shape .
user interface designer : we are we put fashion in electronics ,
industrial designer : that is not
user interface designer : so maybe we can
marketing executive : ? , but if you have a square l_c_d _ screen , and you put a case around it that has like bulbs or that covers part of the l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer :  .
industrial designer : that would cover it .
marketing executive : that
industrial designer : that that would solve the problem .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : that is it is custom customisable and
industrial designer : so so what are the opinions ? rubber or plastic ? i prefer rubber .
marketing executive : me too .
project manager : me too .
industrial designer : you too ?
user interface designer : that is good .
industrial designer : you ? you you seemed to hesitate a bit .
user interface designer : as long a as long as it is firm , and you do not it is not bendable , i th that goes too far .
industrial designer : it should not flop over when you hold it in your hand no , that that is gonna the the chip set will hold it firm in place , and a l_c_d _ screen also
user interface designer : it might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor .
industrial designer : it m might it might . , tra traditional versus l_c_d _ , i figured we all set on that . and , then also the simple versus advanced . i figure if we go for l _ l_c_d _ , we should have the advanced . so that should not be a problem . , that is my , you are welcome .
marketing executive : can i do my thing ?
project manager : . do your thing , tim .
marketing executive : it
user interface designer : do your thing .
project manager : bring it on .
marketing executive : expert map . last week i went to paris and milan for some trend - watching . for marketing . our research and development department and i went to paris and milan . in paris and milan , we asked different people , differing in age and in income , the amount of money to spend , what they like in design and material nowadays . our main audience , so that is people below forty , prefer the following . at first , the colours of fruit . very basic colours , like janus explained . , fresh colours , green , red , strawberry red , yellow , banana yellow . , considering material , . they like spongy material ,
user interface designer : spongeball .
marketing executive : like a sponge - ball . like a s soft material . janus m mentioned it also . he did some findings himself .
industrial designer : the teletubbies sh
marketing executive : you wer you were not in paris ? like big g flashy colours .
project manager : flashy .
marketing executive : it is , . , our secondary audience , people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . , materials like wood that
project manager : but wood is not a material you which you build a remote control of .
industrial designer : you could . you you could .
marketing executive : no n j just a w
project manager : but never seen one .
user interface designer : it will float .
marketing executive : no , but just a wooden look .
project manager : case . , a wooden look , .
marketing executive : like you have those fake panels on the floor .
user interface designer : tables .
marketing executive : the that is not wood anyway , but but , that is our secondary audience . so , we decided to take the people below forty . so , that this does not apply . , there are some overall thoughts about new remote controls . they have to look fancy . , they should be technological in innovative . that means there have to be fancy things in . , and easy to use . but that is common . my personal preferences . we have to aim at a mu at the main audience . and , therefore use fresh colours .
project manager : would you prefer that you can choose the colour of your remote control or
marketing executive : i will come to that in a second point . here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . to customise your own remote control . like the nokia the removable covers , just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one . , a third , material being used could be like rubber . , two advantages . , it fits within the current market trends . and it adds safety to your remote when you drop it . so to come back to your question , and the people in milan and paris also think that the rubber should be pretty hard . like seen on regular mobile phones . actually , they have a lot in common . the phones and the
industrial designer : i actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so .
marketing executive : .
project manager : maybe you could use your remote as a phone .
user interface designer : hey .
industrial designer : hey .
project manager : there are numbers on it , so
industrial designer : that might be a next step .
marketing executive : exactly . , in my second sheet of personal preferences , we have to reconsider the speech function recognition . , it is very innovative .
project manager : so that you say s_p_s_s _ , and it goes to
marketing executive : like something . you you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak speech recognition and . but , we have to keep the cost in mind , but it
user interface designer : twelve fifty
marketing executive : it can be very expensive . , building games like snake or tetris to amuse the younger users . , also the link with mobile phones .
project manager : but you do not use that th games when you watching television , .
marketing executive : no , but no , . but you do not use games when you are d when you are making a telephone call . it is just the same .
user interface designer : when your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else .
project manager : .
marketing executive : when you are at college .
project manager : you take your remote control with you .
user interface designer : take it .
industrial designer : you take your remote with you to school .
marketing executive : no . you al you also take t you take your ipac and go play games . , i do that , but and third , i stick with it , the log - in functionality with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension .
user interface designer : . s
industrial designer : very .
marketing executive : that is it .
project manager : great .
user interface designer : in . the interface contents . that is a just simple powerpoint mock - up i want to m make it more as dynamic for you so i will draw there . but , the main concept is take one big touch screen . , always display the primary buttons clear and visible . maybe even li like this with u uses of a lot of space . and make the menu structure changeable . so if you press system , that is , m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or one , can fit in . or maybe even a step further when you want to t have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . and other buttons can may be displayed here if that is necessary . and , how do we want to look at f does a remote look , it is you have got ta hold it in one hand . so the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands . and some remotes you can use with your thumb . but that is too difficult for this one . so you can make it s a little broader . and maybe use your thumb on the main buttons . and use your other hands on the menu structure . so here are gonna be the program buttons . one , two , three , four , et cetera . and the volume control and program control maybe . and , down here , i added , this could be one big l_c_d _ . , the menu structure . so you can use it in this way . one thing you have got ta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . , know that if you are changing the menu structure here , and , i still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . but if you are programming the colour of the t_v _ , do not display twenty other options that are possible . just keep it as simple as possible . and do not use too many levels . do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un - plus , and push plus twenty times . but just the just in one button if possible . and , you kn you all know the t_v _ levels . , channel one , two . and when you get to n to ten , ye and want to go back , you have a problem . just m most modern t_v_s , you press one zero , and it goes to ten . and else , to one and through after that . so the s a button less . and , things like teletext , put them in the menu . things like
marketing executive : . , what do you think about a back - and - forth come - up button ?
user interface designer : w , i find i must trying to tell it .
marketing executive : l like in internet explorer .
user interface designer : is volume plus and minus ? and this is program plus and minus .
marketing executive : but does it that is for going from four to five .
user interface designer : yes .
marketing executive : but if you go from two to eight , and you want
user interface designer : or if you are watching studio sports on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two
marketing executive : and on two . that you can switch easy .
user interface designer : yes , that is a good idea . but , m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure .
marketing executive : it is .
user interface designer : and if you are using that button a lot of times , the menu will still be displayed on the screen . you just do not have to play games in - between . but if you are really switching between two channels , you wo not have time to d use the other options .
marketing executive : no .
user interface designer : already told that . that is my conclusion .
project manager : we can discuss a little about the three revolutionary things tim came with . the parental control , the games , and the voice recognition . there is n not too much decision on that one so that parental control is a good function to put in the remote . i how you think about it .
user interface designer : i agree , just put it in the menu structure somewhere . , system properties , parental control .
marketing executive : but what i see how i see it is you put it on the remote and then you have like a windows log - on screen with parents , children . something like that .
user interface designer : w , .
marketing executive : and w when you want to use the parents option , you have to
user interface designer : it it has to be fast . you do not want to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and twenty seconds for the log - on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings .
project manager : no but most people find it much more important that their children do not watch sex or violence on the television , and ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can finally watch it because of that .
user interface designer : why you c may use like when there is x_p _ , a simple log - on , d you just push one or two or three .
marketing executive : . pu push parents .
user interface designer : and if you push parents , then
marketing executive : that then you have to go to three - digit log - in .
user interface designer : . and if you puts a ye
marketing executive : like two one three .
user interface designer : and if you w you push p children , you do not have to log in , but you can only watch children is channels or
marketing executive : it automatically goes .
industrial designer : i if it is worth the time and effort we are going to spend on it . because it is a simple function , but it is gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time to programming it . because you will have to start working with the profiles and such . and i am not if it is actually worth investing that much time and effort into it .
project manager : that is a b there is a big market for it ,
industrial designer : i what
project manager : because you , you read many times in magazines same , and you heard on the news that he , they believe that children are influenced by the television ,
marketing executive : v violent t_v _ .
project manager : and , we are aiming to below forty years . but there are a lot of people will below forty who have children in young age who want to not watch violent or
user interface designer : maybe some idea on that . just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , if my grandad would buy this remote , he would not want to bother with all the things to do . just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles .
project manager : that is a that is a better idea ?
marketing executive : w it just has to be w when it is deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain . but if you want to install it personally if i got kids , and i could choose between two remote controls . one w with parent control and one without , and i would buy the one with .
project manager : with and one without .
user interface designer : b , still some question i have about how to incorporate those ones .
marketing executive : i th .
user interface designer : you are thinking about some channels they can not see , but , i when , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock in the evening violent films and movies will come and maybe some timing will be needed instead of channels , because if you are watching , i , you are in the at day , cartoons will come up m on maybe friday night .
project manager : maybe it can work with show view . , you can control your video recorder with show view . , when you tick in a number , it will start and end recording . but maybe there is some option that t the show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out .
user interface designer : the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show - view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all ,
project manager : .
user interface designer : will have to decide
marketing executive : but that is not possible .
user interface designer : that is not possible .
industrial designer : but , if you want to i i if we in incorporate the parental control , let is say we do , and whatever , cho child just goes up to the t_v _ and presses up . , nob nobody is stopping the child from checking the channel .
user interface designer : you could say if parental control is only it will go from fourteen to sixteen with the page - up then , but
industrial designer : but that , i am not because for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the remote control , so it would , have to be constant signalling . what m what may be better is to incorporate an a separate device that you can program with the remote control . and that provides parental control , . and that is just an optional device . so there is n that is there is besides the remote control , you will have a separate
project manager : i would not put it in an optional device . that that then it becomes too much , .
industrial designer : ?
project manager : if we do it , we must do it in a ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise .
user interface designer : on a separate menu option .
marketing executive : and and w when you install another device , children can still go up to the t_v _ , p pop open the thing and g
industrial designer : that is true . that is true ,
marketing executive : go to a channel .
industrial designer : but at same instant , same happens when you have remote control . so
marketing executive : but
industrial designer : but , only difference is the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control , and those people would not necessary want it .
marketing executive : it is
industrial designer : so , you would be
marketing executive : . but it is just an added feature .
project manager : . and what do you guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? i personally think that becomes too much .
user interface designer : i
project manager : it is more like it gets you to the functionality , but
user interface designer : a mail too from management that it is very popular to use voice recon recognition . but i do not think when you are watching t_v _ , hearing loud noises from the t_v _ , someone screaming one , and you f the channel switches , .
marketing executive : like f voice recognition is too much , . but
project manager : and games ?
marketing executive : games . it does not
industrial designer : . see games happening .
user interface designer : w you can put it on chip anyway , so
project manager : that would
user interface designer : as long as it is is not a primary feature of the remote ,
marketing executive : that that does not c that does not co
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : that does not cost a lot of extra resources , .
project manager : so that will that must be in it , you think ?
industrial designer : that will be .
project manager : . so the games are in it . the voice recognition are not . and the parental control are
user interface designer : optional in
project manager : optional ?
marketing executive : it is in it . but too ma so , but
user interface designer : but how we do it ? , also it is a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . so we should make it too complex . is t some menu function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on . but how it is gonna work will f be a problem .
project manager : but will there like the first idea from you can buy it without and with parental contr control ? or are we going to put it in and just
user interface designer : ye best would be to put it in and make it an menu option .
marketing executive : to put
user interface designer : you can put on
marketing executive : to put it in always .
user interface designer : and you can just s when you buy it , you can select personal preference , parental control on , and the password .
industrial designer : i . i figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with a receiver in it . so you could actually easily build in parental control . but it would be more expensive . so , a and that way you could make cheap model and a expensive model . could ma make the simple model and the deluxe model , .
user interface designer : it is a p .
marketing executive : but t_v_s are not capable of sending .
industrial designer : yes they are .
marketing executive : they were just
project manager : you yo
industrial designer : you have some t_v_s any
marketing executive : a able to receive . but
project manager : but most often not .
industrial designer : . that is true , that is true .
user interface designer : maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you can not watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you can not watch all channels after ten o'clock . and there is just some little clock in the remote .
industrial designer : you could easily to the mote control .
marketing executive : j just some rules .
industrial designer : but you still have the problem about the television itself .
user interface designer : no , no , it is very simple . there th i h i have seen some of remotes who have a clock in it . so , the remote does does not transmit when it is after twelve clock .
marketing executive : but , on the t_v _
user interface designer : ?
marketing executive : at least my t_v _ , is a compartment which you can press . and there are buttons behind it which you can use , if you d if you do not have a
user interface designer : that is to put it very blunt , that is not our problem . just have the parents buy some glue and it is not a part of the remote .
industrial designer : that is true .
user interface designer : you have to f .
industrial designer : you could go like
user interface designer : or make it ourselves very diffic
industrial designer : that would actually make things a lot more easy . you could just blame it on television and make it their problem . , i figured i figure we could do that . , i am not what marketing thinks about it , but
marketing executive : or j . i have to consult my legal advisor about it .
project manager : . so we have decided on the things that from janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic . the case will be double - curved and rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour that with cover is removable . the buttons will be touch - screen . but there may not be too many buttons . and in the menu structure , there must not to be five minutes to go . , too many levels . and it must be easy to use . the parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . and the games are in it . so we have decided , .
marketing executive : consensus .
project manager : little more .
marketing executive : . i have one thing left . maybe for jerome .
user interface designer : ? i am listening .
marketing executive : the views . maybe it is handy to build in an expert view and a simple view .
project manager : like a like a moat or s .
user interface designer :
industrial designer : user profile .
marketing executive : like at in the experts view , you have a lot of more buttons .
project manager : but you have that in the
user interface designer : what i was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you do not use it is simple .
project manager : you use the
user interface designer : and when you push system properties , entire list pops up with e ev all f you can program .
project manager : . it is already incorporated a little in that concept .
marketing executive : . fairly enough .
industrial designer : you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users .
marketing executive : wh which buttons you like or not .
industrial designer : which buttons do you want to in it . because you can like build in a back - forward button , and some po somebody would just want to watch two channels .
marketing executive : just leave the other numbers away .
industrial designer : you could m have people want that .
project manager : we take it to the other meeting , i have a little w little chat to do
industrial designer : .
project manager : and then we finish .
marketing executive : a little chat .
project manager : i went to a master class and two things are can come in handy for us . first thing is we talked about knowledge management . knowledge engineering and the fact that the idea of knowledge , sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is like that . it is it is very hot at the moment , so it is mostly for the management expert to look what other
marketing executive : marketing .
project manager : marketing or did i said management ?
marketing executive : management .
project manager : just talking about myself .
marketing executive : that is my function , to
project manager : w what other companies had to also with the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some . import export . and another one .
user interface designer : som some bench - marker .
project manager : they are a ha they are at , benchmarking , that is the word i saw . i could not , another thing is there were there was a survey , and it came out that people like to buy things from a single large provider , instead of those who are partnering with us . so , we must bring it as if real reaction is big company , a trustful company , and it has m
marketing executive : how i know a marketing name for our product . r _ th r _ to the third power . real reaction remote .
project manager : i had a i had another idea to put the whole idea of real reaction and a single brand and that thing .
marketing executive :  ?
project manager : when you put on remote , you see a just like when you telephone , you see a little animation .
user interface designer : logo .
marketing executive : bling .
project manager : real reaction remote . and with the motto , we put fashion in electronics . and then you go
marketing executive : but it has to be like a split second , because you have to put in a code also and
project manager : the
user interface designer : you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds , they will still remember it .
project manager : . but w th the idea from this thing is that we must present it as a as we are a single large provider who will stand on our own .
user interface designer : and it l linger on every time you see it .
industrial designer : if you have the l l_c_d _ screen , you can have a small logo i at the bottom . and it could just stay there .
marketing executive : that spins around like all the time .
project manager :
user interface designer : very annoying .
industrial designer : that spins around .
project manager : also also . but we are
marketing executive : it it is just like a globe in internet explorer .
project manager : y .
industrial designer : . , something like that .
project manager : but think about that things .
user interface designer : i it is for f
project manager : that is what they said in the master class .
user interface designer : for the next meeting , right ?
project manager : n , next meeting starts in thirty minutes .
marketing executive : who
project manager : so maybe you can go to paris and milan once again .
marketing executive : who who gave you the master class ?
project manager : the master class ?
marketing executive : ronald betenberg ?
project manager : franz mehler is . , very special , next session . idea that you the industrial development centre and user interface will work together on a prototype . and will drawing it on the smartboard . so that is a kinda new thing . and , the marketing expert will ke he will be keeping busy with the product evaluation . but the most specific instructions will be sent to you by email .
industrial designer : so we are going to work together right now ?
user interface designer : stay here and
project manager : the , dids this what i heard . i
marketing executive : in the master class .
project manager : not in the master class . so you just for the specific instructions and
user interface designer : p _ .
project manager : but it was a very good session , gentlemen .
user interface designer : no new email .
industrial designer : definitely .
marketing executive : me too .
project manager : i will all .
industrial designer : too .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and
marketing executive : too , lord .
project manager : give me a good evaluation .
marketing executive : guys , lot of success .
industrial designer : you wish .
user interface designer : see you .
industrial designer : m aye ?
project manager : cheers . see you in a half hour . but keep an eye on your laptops for a real
industrial designer : i am not if we because i saw something about individual actions .
project manager : but th there is still the my instructions that you will work together .
user interface designer : here ? or
project manager : that is not my problem .
user interface designer : . if you got a
project manager : bye - bye .
user interface designer : no . so stupid manager .
project manager : the project manager always works alone .
industrial designer : right . do you have new email ?
user interface designer : no .","the project manager went over the agenda . the industrial designer gave a presentation about the options for power source , materials and components . he recommended using kinetic energy , and having a double-curved rubber case . the group decided to combine batteries and kinetic energy . the marketing expert reported on current trends among young people for fresh fruity colours and spongy material . he explained that the remote should look fancy , and be technologically innovative and easy to use . he suggested using removable customisable covers , speech recognition , installing some games into the remote , and implementing a parental control feature . the user interface designer talked about having a simple layout with not many buttons . most features will be controlled through the menu . the group discussed the various options and decided to use games but not speech recognition . after a lot of discussion they decided to implement a simple parental control feature . the project manager talked about what he had learned at a masterclass on knowledge management . the group discussed how to incorporate the company logo and motto onto the remote , including having an animated logo on the touch screen . the project manager gave the group instructions about what to do before the next meeting . the industrial designer and user interface designer will work together on a prototype , using the smartboard . the marketing expert will work on the product evaluation . the energy source will be a combination of batteries and kinetic energy . the case will be double-curved and made of rubber , with fruity-coloured removable covers . there will be a touch screen and not many buttons . the remote will include games and a simple parental control feature . it will not use speech recognition . the user interface designer had problems with his laptop while he was preparing his presentation . the group were unsure about how to implement a parental control feature , or if it would be worth the time and money .
","the user interface designer and the industrial designer had a discussion at length about components and the interface design . the marketing expert presented feedback from a master class on the preferences of two target groups - seniors and young people . they discussed the types of batteries and materials that would be suitable for a remote and discussed the type of case to use for the remote , as well as the buttons and features that would make the device easier to use and to maintain its appearance . after the discussion of the options for batteries , the group discussed what type of buttons would be needed to use , and what kind of casing the device should look like . it was decided that the remote should use a kinetic battery or a rechargeable battery . there was also a problem with the laptop , which caused the remote to not have a scroll wheel , but it was unnecessary and therefore a functional device . all participants will fill out a questionnaire at the next meeting .the group discussed how to make the remote more ergonomically-based on comfort , technologically innovative and aesthetic appeal to both men and women and men . also decided to use an ergonomic design , with a focus on simplicity and technological innovation in order to keep pace with the latest in mind-filled with ease of use .",x,x,x,,,x,,,5.0,T5-Cons
66,"project manager : would not wanna be project manager . , what we going to do . , once again i am gonna take minutes . so , no presentation for me . , first we have a prototype presentation by g _ and g _ . afterwards some
user interface designer : yo .
marketing executive : j _ and j _ .
project manager : eval evalu
industrial designer : evaluation .
project manager : evaluation
user interface designer : evaluation criteria .
marketing executive : evaluation .
project manager : s . evaluation crit criteria . , in combination with the finance i received a an excel file which we have to fill in later on . , and then we must see if we stay under the twelve and a half euro .
marketing executive : .
project manager : so , that is a big
industrial designer :  . that is gonna be t problem .
project manager : l so let is it we have must ,
user interface designer : some creative
project manager : we must have some time for that because it will be , quite a lot of mathematics .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and after that , an evaluation of the process how we have done it here with the smartboard , with the with our laptops , with the all this . and afterwards , we closing . once again , forty minutes , so let is start . i would g give the word to g _ and g _ for the prototype presentation .
user interface designer : shall i give a short introduction and then
industrial designer : .
project manager : j _ and j _ .
user interface designer : j _ and j _ , .
marketing executive : jane and jane . guys , take it away .
user interface designer : take it away .
industrial designer : hi .
user interface designer : this was our first concept . we decided to use a single touch - screen . so , we have worked out this concepts , how to hold it , where to put the buttons and . and , we began with a form of shape , that is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed . so , we made i it a little bit less thick and it has some ar artistic meaning . this is not nothing . idea maybe is better . , during the meeting i showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and the menu structure , if necessary , with your other hand , so it is just gonna hold it easily . and it has to be acce accessible with your other hand too , . so we began working out a concept .
industrial designer : and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel l_c_d _ screen . , these would be the main buttons , h you could change them later on in your own profile if you want to . but , it is standard they will be delivered with this set - up . we have the more advanced menu setting right here . we have the sub - menus and stu . we made a top , or a front view . just so like you wanna back view . as you can see , this there , there are two weird bumps in it . this is for the added effect of y youth and dynamic . and this is for the artistic effect . , what we figured is we will show you a picture later on you have more b a better idea after that . but , idea is for to stay in balance with these two . and so when you put it on the table , it will just lay down . it wo not roll around or . but it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , or like these old phones . y you may get the idea . so thi this is about how we figured it should be . the s panel we g you would hide with some more rubber layers , like we discussed early on . , you would s you would not see the straight panel , but more fluidly and round .
user interface designer : the panel just goes like this . but the overlaying layer is a little bit curved and .
project manager : no , .
industrial designer : and , in these bumps you could actually put some electronics that would you can make a more thinner design , and that would actually look very , . and , about the colour , what have
user interface designer : we added that this can be held with your hands for this maximum is om , one and a half centimetres . so , you have room here for your battery and maybe even other electronic chips . s and you can just be the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as thin as possible in the middle for good grip .
industrial designer : f , as colours , do you have the picture in now , this is the idea about the bumps . , you can see there is a v a very youthful dynamic exterior . it you just want to hold it you are young and dynamic like us .
marketing executive : is l it is like an easter egg .
industrial designer : it is like an e but this is for children . we we want a more adult version . but , this is like a remote control for children .
project manager : it is called a weemote
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : weemote .
project manager : weemote .
industrial designer : hey , that is actually a brilliant marketing stand . , but
marketing executive : what i w got in mind .
industrial designer : so this actually basic the idea . we we just want to build a more adult vers adult version of this .
project manager : imagine that .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : and and for colours , we figured starting with basic colours like white or metallic grey . those are the technological colours actually ,
user interface designer : it would be best to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable ,
industrial designer : so it d
user interface designer : so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple ,
industrial designer : or blue or whatever .
user interface designer : but when the o older people go in the shop and they see an orange remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one . and young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , they think , i will buy for a couple of euros some noi hip
marketing executive : maybe it is an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the shop .
user interface designer : a cover is necessary , als otherwise you will just have the l_c_d _ screen .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : so , there must be some cheap standard cover , maybe white ,
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : that is could comes with it and you can buy , so we can make extra money .
project manager : but you d you must not forget that our target aim is younger people .
marketing executive : oui .
project manager : we had decided to put some flashy fruity colours in it , and in the survey from milan and paris it came out that the d the older people are more willing to spend money on extra features . so it will be a better idea to have some flashy fruity colours as a standard ,
user interface designer : the other way around , you mean .
project manager : and for the people who really want a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they are willing to pay that . they want they want more luxury , but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : so , maybe it is an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard .
industrial designer : . , maybe , perhaps you are right . , i would actually agree with this sounds logical .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : an another idea . , maybe we could develop a cover with wood style . they will the elder users as .
user interface designer : a colour of a wood style , a white c and a couple of h hip fruity colours . and lea l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too much .
industrial designer : nah .
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : this is banana and mango , not purple or p orange and yellow .
marketing executive : exactly .
project manager : but , the mai th the standard must be some attractive flashy colours .
marketing executive : . or blue or
project manager : not too , but w a little ,
user interface designer : .
project manager : because that is our aim .
industrial designer : li like this . this is not this is not too much , is it ?
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : i f
project manager : the buttons do not have to be all of
industrial designer : . the buttons ,
marketing executive : so .
industrial designer : i
marketing executive : except for the buttons it is it could be a standard model .
project manager : it
industrial designer : something like this would be . , that is it from us .
marketing executive : it is my time now .
user interface designer : it is my turn .
project manager : the marketing expert .
industrial designer : uh - oh .
marketing executive : during the design life - cycle we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and . , now is the time to evaluate our prototype concept to the past requirements . so we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis . , we are going to do that with a seven point scale . opening a word document now . one , i have to expla explain something . we have to be consensive about things . so , it has to be a group decision .
project manager :
marketing executive : ?
project manager : so we gon we gonna evaluate the
marketing executive : we are going to vote . we
project manager : the thing we saw .
marketing executive : ? the prototype .
project manager : just saw .
marketing executive : one . the remote control is designed for people with age below forty .
project manager : .
marketing executive : seven is false .
project manager : true .
marketing executive : b one or
project manager : one .
industrial designer : why ?
marketing executive : most true ?
industrial designer : it is not just designed for people under the age of forty . it is also designed for people above forty .
marketing executive : so
industrial designer : so
marketing executive : so a o one is appropriate ?
user interface designer : no no , a little more in the middle .
marketing executive : or , more like a four .
user interface designer : no , three or .
industrial designer : i have i have
marketing executive : three .
industrial designer : two or three , because it is not just the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty . but it is also designed for people of age above forty . so ,
marketing executive : exactly .
industrial designer : i will say it is about three .
user interface designer : it will be primary appealing to m minus forty , but also appealing to
marketing executive : but also for , . the remote control is beautiful .
user interface designer : it is
marketing executive : acco according to us , it is one ? or
user interface designer : it is the marketing angle on television . we have a wonderful
marketing executive : p s of c you have to be very positive and enthusiastic about your own product .
user interface designer : it is also fancy then .
marketing executive : the remote control looks fancy .
industrial designer : yes .
marketing executive : one ?
user interface designer : . we have a perfect remote .
marketing executive : good . the remote control has big , clear channel switching buttons .
user interface designer : yes . they have to agree but
project manager : yes .
industrial designer : leads to user face , .
user interface designer : i am the user interface expert .
marketing executive : daniel . , teletext buttons and volume buttons ?
user interface designer : no .
project manager : no teletext buttons . teletext is in the menu .
user interface designer : you you have different menu .
industrial designer : false .
marketing executive : false ?
user interface designer : and volume is impo
marketing executive : and volume ?
project manager : volume is true .
marketing executive : true . big and clear ?
industrial designer : the they are big and clear .
user interface designer : big and clear .
project manager : big and clear .
user interface designer : but you could make a teletext button six .
marketing executive : hey .
user interface designer : otherwise , the people who read this are gonna think we have no teletext button .
marketing executive : hide .
industrial designer : but the teletext button . , you can ch that is in a menu .
marketing executive : it is it is not
industrial designer : so , it is w , it
marketing executive : it
industrial designer : it is not entirely unclear ,
marketing executive : j

industrial designer : i would give it a more a five or a six .
marketing executive : five ?
industrial designer : i don i . what do you think , mister project manager ?
marketing executive : it is .
project manager : . i was thinking very black and white .
user interface designer : black and red .
project manager : j _ .
user interface designer : do not forget to save it .
marketing executive : red . the remote control is easy to be found .
user interface designer : when we put in fancy colours ,
project manager : fruity .
user interface designer : and
industrial designer : it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape . so , if you so if you have trouble finding it
user interface designer : but , it is not making any sound , have we deciding ?
marketing executive :
user interface designer : so
marketing executive : but if you put your normal remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ?
user interface designer : it will make a difference . we have the better re i . my remote control is black .
marketing executive : a li little bit maybe ?
user interface designer : a little bit , but .
project manager : we p we can do it glow in the dark .
marketing executive : four ? fi
project manager : so , if it is in the dark place , you still see it glowing .
user interface designer : k .
marketing executive : i
user interface designer : fo fo five is .
marketing executive : five . it is it is it does not really make a lot of
industrial designer : then i will go for four . because four is between three and also between true and false .
user interface designer : you are right .
marketing executive : yes , but five is between four and six .
industrial designer : so i will go for four .
project manager : you must see it as , w according to the other remote controls , there may be there in your t_v _ room , this one will stand out , .
industrial designer : wha
marketing executive : b _ .
industrial designer : that is a better question actually .
project manager : exa that is what it is about .
marketing executive : it is
user interface designer : if your fifteen remotes in a drawer , you find it , ?
project manager : if it if this lying on your couch , you are you think what is that for kinda orange thing . so
marketing executive : but but the survey under users was that they really lost it .
user interface designer : that is stupid .
marketing executive : like , no not seeing it , but lost it in the house .
user interface designer : but when you lost it you are just not
marketing executive : but , .
industrial designer : if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere , then you would recognise it as , whoa , that is strange .
project manager : that is our remote control .
user interface designer : mostly when you lose your remote control , it is under your
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : what is that . ,
user interface designer : most of times when you lose it you are sitting on it .
industrial designer : so it is
marketing executive : eight , the remote control has fresh , fruity colours .
project manager : true .
user interface designer : i would call choose two , we decided not to make two f fresh colours , as it would not .
marketing executive : not too flashy . the remote control is made of soft material .
industrial designer : rubber , is soft .
project manager : but not too soft we have decided .
user interface designer : kinda soft , but not this .
marketing executive : three ?
project manager : three , .
user interface designer : easy to use ,
project manager : easy to use .
user interface designer : very afford .
marketing executive : easy to use ?
project manager : can it be zero ?
industrial designer : i don , it is
marketing executive : top easy to use ? it is it is not the most easy to use
user interface designer : you can do two , because
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : it can be easier .
user interface designer : it can be easier . but then you are l
industrial designer : it could .
marketing executive : jus just with ten buttons , that is the easiest .
user interface designer : but then you will lose function f , functionality and our fancy look , so .
industrial designer : functional ability .
marketing executive : but the most easy to use is just with one button
user interface designer : but it is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible .
marketing executive : on t , but easy n not the most easy to use , .
industrial designer : no , it is it i will go for two . my vote is on two .
marketing executive : two ?
project manager : two .
user interface designer : m mine too .
marketing executive : we also have to compare it to the remote controls on the market nowadays . so
user interface designer : but waits just a minutes .
project manager : what is the time ? we also have to do the evaluation , the production costs and .
user interface designer : these are the m regular remotes .
marketing executive : i am hurrying . the remote control is innovative .
user interface designer : yes , true , one .
project manager : you are agree , tim ?
marketing executive : a very
project manager : you have not seen a more innovative thing in paris ?
marketing executive : the remote control has m remova removable from multilux .
user interface designer : yes , one . very multifunctional .
marketing executive : the remote control , i it has speech recognition .
project manager : false .
industrial designer : yes ,
marketing executive : false .
industrial designer : it
user interface designer : this is used with speech recognition , this .
marketing executive : the remote control has built - in games ?
user interface designer : but , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub - menu and not it is not an entire game .
project manager : but they are built in , so it is one .
industrial designer : they are built in .
marketing executive : and the last , paren parental advisory function .
industrial designer : you really like the parental advisory .
project manager : freak .
marketing executive : yes , i do .
user interface designer : th did you make this or the
industrial designer : bu
marketing executive : save as .
industrial designer : he made it .
user interface designer : it changes it maybe .
marketing executive : i will
user interface designer : yay .
marketing executive : do the math .
user interface designer : dear .
marketing executive : now it is your turn .
project manager : we will see .
user interface designer : ?
project manager : we have now to c to calculate the production cost . if it is under twelve and half euro , then it is . but i is it if it is b ? no , this is not right .
user interface designer : if they are under twelve fifty .
project manager : if they under . , it is
user interface designer : ?
project manager : if the costs are under twelve and a half euro , then we can ra move on to the project evaluation , as we have experienced it . otherwise , we have do have to do a little redesign thingy . so , we have to fill in the numbers of the component components . we have to fil , want to do it in and see if we stay under the twelve and a half euro . so , do we have a hand dynamo ?
industrial designer : me , too .
user interface designer : battery , yes .
project manager : battery , one ?
user interface designer : one , .
project manager : kinetic , one ?
user interface designer : kinetic , one .
industrial designer : .
project manager : solar cells , zero . , simple chip on print ?
industrial designer : n no .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : no ? no , advanced chip .
marketing executive : advanced chip .
project manager : sample sensor sample speaker ?
user interface designer : no , the advanced chip is
marketing executive : advanced chip is three .
project manager : three ?
marketing executive : three euros , .
project manager : but it is one thing , it is three euro .
industrial designer : we have one . we have one
marketing executive : one piece , .
project manager : what is the sample sensor ?
industrial designer : no , sev zero . , that is
marketing executive : speech recognition , .
user interface designer : you give it a sample , one .
industrial designer : speech recognition and s
project manager : zero . , uncurved flat .
industrial designer : a zero .
project manager : but is it s it is not made from a single uncurved thingy and then
user interface designer : you no .
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : thingy .
project manager : no ? so it is only once double - curved .
marketing executive : yes ,
user interface designer : the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the o on the back of the
marketing executive : three .
project manager : we are now in a problem , we have reached eleven euro yet .
user interface designer : we do not have anything else . so
marketing executive : go on .
project manager : but we have
industrial designer : just go on . then we will see wha how much we are over budget .
user interface designer : could you step a little to the right ma
marketing executive : two .
project manager : rubber .
user interface designer : or
project manager : you .
industrial designer : zero .
project manager : titanium , no ?
user interface designer : and zero . special is the special colour ?
project manager : special colour ?
industrial designer : i do not . no , this is a standard colour .
project manager : but we want to make the wood colours , that
marketing executive : s
industrial designer : yes , this is a special colour .
user interface designer : if you are honest , we will type one , special colour .
marketing executive : but d but daniel , tha that is another brand .
industrial designer : that is an add - on .
marketing executive : that is another article to sell .
project manager : but we going to , that is true . but , it is it
user interface designer : j maybe we will finish the list first and then look back , aye ?
marketing executive : that does not account for this . producing this .
project manager : the push - button , no .
user interface designer : scroll wheel , no .
project manager : scroll - wheel , no . , button , no . no , the
user interface designer : is it
project manager : we do not have a s
user interface designer : no .
industrial designer : these three .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : we are only four euro over budget .
project manager : . so , what is the thing we can change ?
industrial designer : but , other case , we can make it single - curved or uncurved .
project manager : can i say something ?
user interface designer : single - curves .
project manager : no , can i say something as project manager ? the kinetic thing , can we just skip it ,
user interface designer : just cut off the kine
project manager : because you have to shake it , but that is not really innovative .
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : we just put a good battery it . mobile phones nowadays .
marketing executive : daniel . daniel ,
project manager : yo .
marketing executive : what do you think about here .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : what do you think about putting a battery in it , but also selling like the covers , a docking station just apart from the thing , so that you can put
project manager :  .
marketing executive : rechargeable batteries in it and just
user interface designer : but you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual .
project manager : and not really .
marketing executive : .
project manager : but we if you forget about the kinetic ,
marketing executive : just an idea .
user interface designer : that is a cost reduc
project manager : if we do that , we shall .
industrial designer : you can go from double - curved to single - curved . and that would solve the budget problem .
project manager : b but i but the single - curved is just
user interface designer : so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then no , it is just one curve and not a back curved . or
industrial designer : it is just , the single - curve that .
project manager : so that is wh tha that is one option .
user interface designer : or are these two curves ?
project manager : and then w , and then we could have it , but it is its ' it is r it is the main point of the look .
user interface designer : but what else do we have to cut out ? no advanced chip , that is a little bit of problem .
industrial designer : we going to cut
project manager : no , tho that can be done . so ,
user interface designer : although , can we make it with a regular chip ?
project manager : a little less conversation .
user interface designer : curvy .
marketing executive : hey , those ar arcs , why are there for ? the blue
project manager : fill in just a
user interface designer : explanation .
project manager : explanation .
user interface designer : twelve fifty .
project manager : delete it for you if you want .
marketing executive : no , no .
project manager : so , if we do this , we are on twelve and a half euro . and we are done .
user interface designer : but does it fit with our design ?
project manager : the only thing that do not
user interface designer : do we have to u adapt it ? it is single - curves .
project manager : single - curved , but there is a curve in it . so
user interface designer : w could we just make the bubbles cut off the back , and then we are has
industrial designer : we just make it flat . but , you do l
marketing executive : but , wha , look , what is the if you make it double - curved , it costs one euro more .
user interface designer : more . you make it optional .
marketing executive : but no , but does it have a lot of extra
industrial designer : function .
user interface designer : functional .
marketing executive : fun function more like
industrial designer : worth , does it have added worth ?
user interface designer : there is an a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality .
industrial designer : no ,
project manager : it is really a static value .
marketing executive : aesthetic . , you make like eleven and a half euros profit instead of twelve and a half . but i if twelve and a half is a fixed price .
project manager : it is .
industrial designer : let is assume it is .
marketing executive : no , we ca not go above that .
industrial designer : we we should assume it i that it is . but i figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : r if you promote a kinetic i kinetic remote control , that would b sell better than an a normal remote control .
project manager : do you think ? , now you can shake your remote control .
marketing executive : so .
industrial designer : no , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k remote control is kinetic .
project manager : kinetic .
industrial designer : you have standard old battery control remote con
marketing executive : what a what about all the m the environment freaks ?
user interface designer : but it does not fit in our co cost profile . so
marketing executive : not freaks , the envi
industrial designer : true .
marketing executive : it look like this one .
user interface designer : you ma can make an especialised extra gold version .
project manager : who because if you want to go to kinetic , you are on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , and now it is more of a compromise thing . and if you make the single curve ha just a big curve , then it is
user interface designer : just one big curve .
project manager : one big good curve . i was going to say nasty words , but i do not . this is strange . wood is m is cheaper than rubber . we thought that wood would be more expensive .
user interface designer : this american figures . you just cut down some trees .
project manager : maybe . but that this is it ?
marketing executive : this is it .
user interface designer : whoever makes a remote control out of titanium .
project manager : i am gonna save it .
industrial designer : it is possible , but you ca not use double curves for titanium . that is one of the functionability
project manager : considering we have
marketing executive : no , we have to do all those hours again . costs on no redesign .
project manager : we were above , so we did a little redesign
user interface designer : we sue . we , we will start her all o all over again .
project manager : now it is about time to talk about this project . , some things . were there room for was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ?
marketing executive : i did not . that there was a lot of room for it . but , that is mainly because of the information that was delivered to us . it was just fixed information and get your from there , and i could not go on i on the internet and search my own . bu
project manager : that is true . i agree with that .
industrial designer : i th you two , especially you and daniel , you d you both had the less creative roles in the project .
project manager : .
user interface designer : for us , there was a lot of creativity .
industrial designer : m
user interface designer : we could just sign up an remote if we liked .
industrial designer : jeroen and i , we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than you two .
marketing executive : . , that is true .
project manager : how about the leadership ?
industrial designer : ha .
marketing executive : leadership was crappy .
user interface designer : crappy . cra
industrial designer : nah , the leadership was not crappy , it was the leader that was crappy .
project manager : very much .
industrial designer : nah . no , the leadership was .
project manager : now we are done .
user interface designer : example of crappy leadershi
marketing executive : no , leadership was
industrial designer : it was good .
marketing executive : the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . , you could have but , it was your first , no disrespect , but you could have structure it a l little bit more . so like , i was talking most of the time the first meeting , and
user interface designer : you could of said , shut up you fool .
project manager : . i notice it too . i was a i was also very unhappy , very unsatisfied about the
marketing executive : about me .
project manager : about the first meeting . so , i hope the other meetings
industrial designer : try to learn from your mistake . and we will never do it again .
marketing executive : you made up .
project manager : get better and the last two meetings also we reached some good decisions about talk
marketing executive : no , it you did better .
user interface designer : more consensus . ev everybody w was agreeing every
marketing executive : much more constructive .
project manager : so that is . , maybe that is only , it is for us , because
user interface designer : we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task .
project manager : and it is wo more like presentation and some points were discussed .
user interface designer : so , it is a little bit
project manager : but , really teamwork were you two
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : two guys .
project manager : the
industrial designer : that went w it went . it is it is just
user interface designer : stupid stupid pen , but
project manager : no hard feelings .
industrial designer : nah . , we had some trouble with the pen , but
project manager : now you must push a little while .
user interface designer : but draw something difficult .
industrial designer : but us
user interface designer : d just write your name right now . try to write your name , in writing letters , ? , normally , this the w block letter sign it , ?
project manager : o just
user interface designer : just just write your name in one line . if it is a little bit too small bit quicker now .
project manager : you can be you can go quicker , then it wo not notice it .
user interface designer : it did not he knows how it works , .
project manager : i follow the master class for the smartboard , so that is the main issue . , so about this one you were you are dealing with ,
marketing executive : means .
project manager : the digital pen .
user interface designer : y , . th the i the idea is great , but it does not work properly .
project manager : .
marketing executive : digital pen , th the first time i did individual work , i used it . but , a and the first two meetings i brought it with me , but i did not use it after the first meeting .
industrial designer : no , i have it working . but ,
marketing executive : it is it is not real use for me .
industrial designer : no , it does not have that much added value to the
user interface designer : nee . as as i said a m a c few moments ago , it i would like , myself , to write with a normal pen , because must , it is almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . i it is the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s very slow .
project manager : m . and it is still your own handwriting popping up in word .
user interface designer : yes . no , and it does not give any added value .
project manager : no , that is true .
marketing executive : not really , no .
project manager : and the smartboard is useful , but the pen is i not user - friendly , .
user interface designer : not user - friendly .
project manager : be it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things ,
user interface designer : and it is not very precise .
project manager : and that is the
user interface designer : we are trying to m to
marketing executive : like when you do this .
user interface designer : it may , and tr try to wri write your name in a normal size , .
marketing executive : smaller ?
user interface designer : smaller . just like when you are writing on a letter .
project manager : but that is not th the you when you at a foreign audience , you b do not gonna wr write small .
user interface designer : a as you saw on this drawing , just open this one or that one . it is th it , we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons , it is almost impossible to get clear when you are
project manager : but maybe there is some function with no , it is not . with
user interface designer : and the eraser was another problem . it w t is this large . and when you try to erase this line , y
project manager : i am gonna erase my name .
user interface designer : i am gonna erase my name there .
project manager : it is a big eraser .
marketing executive : new ideas ?
user interface designer : m abo what new ideas ?
project manager : the idea of the touch - screen is
marketing executive : do you ?
project manager : i am just
user interface designer : new ideas about the working of this software , about the project , about the remote controls or
marketing executive : .
project manager : i what .
user interface designer : hello .
marketing executive : did you heard what he said ? i do not i what . , i have some figure . the eva the evaluation , the mean number is one point eight six .
project manager : that is interesting .
marketing executive : so that is fairly good , .
project manager : because what does it mean ?
user interface designer : so true .
marketing executive : that
project manager : all the mo , are between one and two .
marketing executive : all the requirements are true or very true , right .
project manager : . but the new ideas found for wi with working with this software ?
user interface designer : not really , just they have to improve it .
project manager : not really , ?
user interface designer : the concept is , but it has to be quicker . , it is still opening my programme , n almo almost my entire computer is locked up during the process and it , just takes too many time . people will still feel the need to write it quickly on a page and not download it and save it , and
project manager : you had expected it to be more
user interface designer : more user - friendly . when you use a pen , you can just draw like you d draw normally , and you do
marketing executive : may maybe the idea you proposed is a screen here . and draw it , and it is placed over there .
user interface designer : that l would be easier . or at least when you do not have to adapt to the technology , just you can write in the way you normally write . and now you have to keep constantly in mind that you are drawing on this screen .
marketing executive : ?
user interface designer : and that is a very bad concept .
marketing executive : very bad .
user interface designer : nah , i it is my opinion that i
marketing executive : this is better than regular flip - overs ,
user interface designer : it is can be saved easier . but if you are in normal flip - over you a lot of people write text . there is no text option . and writing text , you have got ta really do your best to write some
project manager : and maybe some functions for circle or a square . you have to draw it yourself now .
user interface designer : or maybe even insert picture . if you have some presentation , and you have some f
industrial designer : or text function . just t type text , and that would be excellent . mean
marketing executive : but insert image is not available ?
user interface designer : then you could
marketing executive : here . picture from scanner , clip - art .
project manager : that can be done already . but not the predefined squares
user interface designer : so you can
marketing executive : hyperlink ? hey , what if you do like hyperlink ?
user interface designer : with w_w _ dot google dot com .
marketing executive : type type it ?
user interface designer : maybe .
marketing executive : re real reaction dot n_l _ . yes , is now is .
user interface designer : you will just make a link in
project manager : that is .
user interface designer : there is one way to
project manager : is it
marketing executive : double - click it .
user interface designer : maybe if you are not using the eraser
project manager : here .
marketing executive : you are erasing .
user interface designer : something else th , arrow .
project manager : .
marketing executive : double - click it .
project manager : so you have
user interface designer : it is
project manager : as you saw , you have a little , you can you can go there . so there the functionality is there , but it is not ideal , and it is very it costs a lot of time to
user interface designer : to use , .
project manager : to use . and that is a pity , if you have thirty , forty minutes for this things , and we are now with four people ,
user interface designer : and that is m
project manager : but it , imagine you are here you are with the ten people and everyone
user interface designer : that is mostly the case , from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case , and if you have to do all this kind
project manager : two minutes of drawing , .
user interface designer : you will rather use powerpoint and work it out in advance . and th the one or two things you have to draw when you are there , just use a flip - board .
marketing executive : what i really miss also is a d is a turtle is a decision system like with the evaluation , you have to polls like , what do you want , a one , a two , maybe a l a little application like give your own number and click one two three four five six seven .
project manager : just like he said with the a screen which you can write , also a voting mechanism .
marketing executive : j ju , v voting application . just a little group decision application .
industrial designer : but , problem is , you ca not discuss anything you ca you can , but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now . we w one person s maybe said three . but , i we said , no i w th think two , because this and this , and then you can react on it . but if you put a three on it , just figure , everybody knows what i am knowing , so they will all just put a two on .
marketing executive : . but , you can still discuss about it ,
industrial designer : but it would .
marketing executive : but click it in an application , that is a lot easier to process .
industrial designer : the for processing part .
marketing executive : the digit .
industrial designer : but then , the idea of one person entering it and the rest discussing it , that is not that bad idea , actually . not that your opinion is not valued , but still .
project manager : so
user interface designer : yo , manager .
marketing executive : that is it ?
project manager : just about ,
user interface designer : when are w
project manager : because
user interface designer : when are we going to produce it ?
project manager : tomorrow ? , the costs are within the budget .
marketing executive : celebration .
project manager : the project is evaluated . but , before we going to celebrate , i have a little question which you ca not answer , because there must be some end report . i am busy with the end report right now . you might thinking what the hell was he doing
marketing executive : what is an end report ?
project manager : about all the meetings , what we have decided , a r a report of this day . , that must be made , but i , here is standing whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is
marketing executive : you ha you have ten minutes left , i read . you have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report .
project manager : that can be done . maybe we can do it together . you can see what i have so i s i will put it on a story - board . you can see it . because it will it must be
marketing executive : you you already made a beta version , or
project manager : it is a three with seventy five
marketing executive : pages .
project manager : just about .
industrial designer : y yikes . seventy five pages .
project manager : just a moment .
marketing executive : daniel . do you want a chair maybe ?
user interface designer : a chairman .
project manager : no no ,
marketing executive : hey ?
project manager : you can s you can read it and here it is .
industrial designer : so you finished it actually , and so we just have to read it and say yes or no ?
project manager : this not nit it read - only . but it is not fully finished yet .
marketing executive : five minutes for finishing .
project manager : this is about the functional design , the things .
marketing executive : management expert , you have to change that .
project manager : i am when i said it , i remember i had it here .
marketing executive : marketing .
user interface designer : it is a read - only version .
marketing executive : but you can save it u the under another name .
project manager : marketing expert , about the three functions where which are most used and which must immediately be visible on our remote control . , it must be simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people . so , this is really about wh what kind things must be in it and
marketing executive : maybe the
project manager : i understand you , talk a little bit dutch .
marketing executive : the you . no , you have to put , switch channels at the top , because that is the most used function and teletext at the second
project manager : oka , i really did not knew that .
marketing executive : nay , a volume changing , second .
project manager : so , this one is first .
marketing executive : s switch , yes .
project manager : you go there and you go there .
marketing executive : go on .
project manager : maybe then do it one two three .
marketing executive : yes , very good .
user interface designer : one two three .
project manager : if the order is in is important , that is the word for .
marketing executive : the order .
project manager : then the conceptual design . , all the things we have discussed , the energy , which turn out to be batteries , so that is
user interface designer : maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost .
project manager : because . , he here it is still double - curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable .
marketing executive : single - curves .
project manager : the buttons
industrial designer : it is not double .
user interface designer : a single - curved .
industrial designer : it is not double anymore , ?
project manager : not double anymore .
marketing executive : no , .
project manager : nay but that this is what
marketing executive : was initial , the plan . the initial plan .
project manager : and the added functions like tetris snake , it is under the parental control , the touch - screen . so , it is just a summary of what we had discussed
industrial designer : on thing one small thing , the added functions . , was it included in the cost ?
user interface designer : it is very cheap .
project manager : it is very cheap ,
industrial designer : it is very cheap .
project manager : you maybe you come at
marketing executive : no , it is not very cheap , but that
project manager : it is very necessary .
marketing executive : no , but it is a development inside corporation . like , w we do not have to buy parental control . our own people can make that , .
project manager : but it still has some
marketing executive : it has some cost , but
project manager : . , but so we can discuss that

project manager :  .
user interface designer : on the bottom . and clearly , touch - screen you have mentioned .
project manager : touch - screen i have mentioned .
marketing executive : but the decisions are put in the conclusion , . why we decided to use a flat l_c_d _ .

project manager : i am going to finish my end report .
user interface designer : saved ?
industrial designer : hereby is the meeting is finished .
marketing executive : you declare .
project manager : i am the one who can say that . hereby the meeting is finished .","the project manager opened the meeting and went over the agenda . the user interface designer and the industrial designer presented their prototype design , describing the shape and layout of the remote . the group discussed colour options and decided to make the standard remote in fruity colours , but with the option of buying different exchangeable covers which might appeal more to older buyers . the marketing expert led the prototype evaluation and the group were happy with their product . the group calculated the production costs . the group were 4 euros over budget , so they decided to make the case single-curved and not to use kinetic energy . the project manager led the evaluation of the project process . the group felt that only the industrial designer and the user interface designer were able to be creative and work as a team . it was felt that the first meeting was disorganised because of poor leadership but the leadership improved in the later meetings . the group were also had problems with the digital pens . the group helped the project manager fill in the final report before the close of the meeting . the project manager will finish the final report . the remote will come in fruity colours as standard with the option of buying different exchangeable covers . the case will be single-curved instead of double-curved . the remote will be battery powered and will no longer use kinetic energy . the production costs were 4 euros over budget . which features should be changed to reduce production costs . there were not enough opportunities for creativity and teamwork . the digital pens did not work very well .
","the project manager opened the meeting and had the team members introduce the prototype they created and present it to the group . the industrial designer gave an evaluation of the prototype and discussed its appearance and the placement of the buttons . the team then looked at the production costs of the remote and found that their remote was actually under budget and that they could retain all of the features they had originally decided upon without exceeding the target cost . the marketing expert conducted an evaluation of the project process and found that the group worked well together and were creative . the team also evaluated the project process and found that they were happy with the tools available to them . the project manager then led the team in calculating the production costs of their remote . the remote was under budget and could retain all of the features they had originally decided upon without exceeding the target cost . the team then evaluated the project process and found that they were happy with the tools available to them , and that they could retain all of the features they had originally decided upon without exceeding the target cost . the marketing expert conducted an evaluation of the project process and found that the group worked well together and were creative . the team also evaluated the project process and found that they were happy with the tools available to them . the remote was under budget and could retain all of the features they had originally decided upon without exceeding the target cost . the team also evaluated the project process and found that they were happy with the tools available to them . the remote was under budget and could retain all of the features they had originally decided",x,x,,x,x,,,,3.0,Pegasus-Baseline
67,"project manager : would not wanna be project manager . , what we going to do . , once again i am gonna take minutes . so , no presentation for me . , first we have a prototype presentation by g _ and g _ . afterwards some
user interface designer : yo .
marketing executive : j _ and j _ .
project manager : eval evalu
industrial designer : evaluation .
project manager : evaluation
user interface designer : evaluation criteria .
marketing executive : evaluation .
project manager : s . evaluation crit criteria . , in combination with the finance i received a an excel file which we have to fill in later on . , and then we must see if we stay under the twelve and a half euro .
marketing executive : .
project manager : so , that is a big
industrial designer :  . that is gonna be t problem .
project manager : l so let is it we have must ,
user interface designer : some creative
project manager : we must have some time for that because it will be , quite a lot of mathematics .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and after that , an evaluation of the process how we have done it here with the smartboard , with the with our laptops , with the all this . and afterwards , we closing . once again , forty minutes , so let is start . i would g give the word to g _ and g _ for the prototype presentation .
user interface designer : shall i give a short introduction and then
industrial designer : .
project manager : j _ and j _ .
user interface designer : j _ and j _ , .
marketing executive : jane and jane . guys , take it away .
user interface designer : take it away .
industrial designer : hi .
user interface designer : this was our first concept . we decided to use a single touch - screen . so , we have worked out this concepts , how to hold it , where to put the buttons and . and , we began with a form of shape , that is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed . so , we made i it a little bit less thick and it has some ar artistic meaning . this is not nothing . idea maybe is better . , during the meeting i showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and the menu structure , if necessary , with your other hand , so it is just gonna hold it easily . and it has to be acce accessible with your other hand too , . so we began working out a concept .
industrial designer : and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel l_c_d _ screen . , these would be the main buttons , h you could change them later on in your own profile if you want to . but , it is standard they will be delivered with this set - up . we have the more advanced menu setting right here . we have the sub - menus and stu . we made a top , or a front view . just so like you wanna back view . as you can see , this there , there are two weird bumps in it . this is for the added effect of y youth and dynamic . and this is for the artistic effect . , what we figured is we will show you a picture later on you have more b a better idea after that . but , idea is for to stay in balance with these two . and so when you put it on the table , it will just lay down . it wo not roll around or . but it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , or like these old phones . y you may get the idea . so thi this is about how we figured it should be . the s panel we g you would hide with some more rubber layers , like we discussed early on . , you would s you would not see the straight panel , but more fluidly and round .
user interface designer : the panel just goes like this . but the overlaying layer is a little bit curved and .
project manager : no , .
industrial designer : and , in these bumps you could actually put some electronics that would you can make a more thinner design , and that would actually look very , . and , about the colour , what have
user interface designer : we added that this can be held with your hands for this maximum is om , one and a half centimetres . so , you have room here for your battery and maybe even other electronic chips . s and you can just be the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as thin as possible in the middle for good grip .
industrial designer : f , as colours , do you have the picture in now , this is the idea about the bumps . , you can see there is a v a very youthful dynamic exterior . it you just want to hold it you are young and dynamic like us .
marketing executive : is l it is like an easter egg .
industrial designer : it is like an e but this is for children . we we want a more adult version . but , this is like a remote control for children .
project manager : it is called a weemote
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : weemote .
project manager : weemote .
industrial designer : hey , that is actually a brilliant marketing stand . , but
marketing executive : what i w got in mind .
industrial designer : so this actually basic the idea . we we just want to build a more adult vers adult version of this .
project manager : imagine that .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : and and for colours , we figured starting with basic colours like white or metallic grey . those are the technological colours actually ,
user interface designer : it would be best to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable ,
industrial designer : so it d
user interface designer : so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple ,
industrial designer : or blue or whatever .
user interface designer : but when the o older people go in the shop and they see an orange remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one . and young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , they think , i will buy for a couple of euros some noi hip
marketing executive : maybe it is an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the shop .
user interface designer : a cover is necessary , als otherwise you will just have the l_c_d _ screen .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : so , there must be some cheap standard cover , maybe white ,
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : that is could comes with it and you can buy , so we can make extra money .
project manager : but you d you must not forget that our target aim is younger people .
marketing executive : oui .
project manager : we had decided to put some flashy fruity colours in it , and in the survey from milan and paris it came out that the d the older people are more willing to spend money on extra features . so it will be a better idea to have some flashy fruity colours as a standard ,
user interface designer : the other way around , you mean .
project manager : and for the people who really want a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they are willing to pay that . they want they want more luxury , but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : so , maybe it is an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard .
industrial designer : . , maybe , perhaps you are right . , i would actually agree with this sounds logical .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : an another idea . , maybe we could develop a cover with wood style . they will the elder users as .
user interface designer : a colour of a wood style , a white c and a couple of h hip fruity colours . and lea l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too much .
industrial designer : nah .
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : this is banana and mango , not purple or p orange and yellow .
marketing executive : exactly .
project manager : but , the mai th the standard must be some attractive flashy colours .
marketing executive : . or blue or
project manager : not too , but w a little ,
user interface designer : .
project manager : because that is our aim .
industrial designer : li like this . this is not this is not too much , is it ?
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : i f
project manager : the buttons do not have to be all of
industrial designer : . the buttons ,
marketing executive : so .
industrial designer : i
marketing executive : except for the buttons it is it could be a standard model .
project manager : it
industrial designer : something like this would be . , that is it from us .
marketing executive : it is my time now .
user interface designer : it is my turn .
project manager : the marketing expert .
industrial designer : uh - oh .
marketing executive : during the design life - cycle we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and . , now is the time to evaluate our prototype concept to the past requirements . so we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis . , we are going to do that with a seven point scale . opening a word document now . one , i have to expla explain something . we have to be consensive about things . so , it has to be a group decision .
project manager :
marketing executive : ?
project manager : so we gon we gonna evaluate the
marketing executive : we are going to vote . we
project manager : the thing we saw .
marketing executive : ? the prototype .
project manager : just saw .
marketing executive : one . the remote control is designed for people with age below forty .
project manager : .
marketing executive : seven is false .
project manager : true .
marketing executive : b one or
project manager : one .
industrial designer : why ?
marketing executive : most true ?
industrial designer : it is not just designed for people under the age of forty . it is also designed for people above forty .
marketing executive : so
industrial designer : so
marketing executive : so a o one is appropriate ?
user interface designer : no no , a little more in the middle .
marketing executive : or , more like a four .
user interface designer : no , three or .
industrial designer : i have i have
marketing executive : three .
industrial designer : two or three , because it is not just the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty . but it is also designed for people of age above forty . so ,
marketing executive : exactly .
industrial designer : i will say it is about three .
user interface designer : it will be primary appealing to m minus forty , but also appealing to
marketing executive : but also for , . the remote control is beautiful .
user interface designer : it is
marketing executive : acco according to us , it is one ? or
user interface designer : it is the marketing angle on television . we have a wonderful
marketing executive : p s of c you have to be very positive and enthusiastic about your own product .
user interface designer : it is also fancy then .
marketing executive : the remote control looks fancy .
industrial designer : yes .
marketing executive : one ?
user interface designer : . we have a perfect remote .
marketing executive : good . the remote control has big , clear channel switching buttons .
user interface designer : yes . they have to agree but
project manager : yes .
industrial designer : leads to user face , .
user interface designer : i am the user interface expert .
marketing executive : daniel . , teletext buttons and volume buttons ?
user interface designer : no .
project manager : no teletext buttons . teletext is in the menu .
user interface designer : you you have different menu .
industrial designer : false .
marketing executive : false ?
user interface designer : and volume is impo
marketing executive : and volume ?
project manager : volume is true .
marketing executive : true . big and clear ?
industrial designer : the they are big and clear .
user interface designer : big and clear .
project manager : big and clear .
user interface designer : but you could make a teletext button six .
marketing executive : hey .
user interface designer : otherwise , the people who read this are gonna think we have no teletext button .
marketing executive : hide .
industrial designer : but the teletext button . , you can ch that is in a menu .
marketing executive : it is it is not
industrial designer : so , it is w , it
marketing executive : it
industrial designer : it is not entirely unclear ,
marketing executive : j
industrial designer : but so , i would not give it a seven .
user interface designer : no .
industrial designer : i would give it a more a five or a six .
marketing executive : five ?
industrial designer : i don i . what do you think , mister project manager ?
marketing executive : it is .
project manager : . i was thinking very black and white .
user interface designer : black and red .
project manager : j _ .
user interface designer : do not forget to save it .
marketing executive : red . the remote control is easy to be found .
user interface designer : when we put in fancy colours ,
project manager : fruity .
user interface designer : and
industrial designer : it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape . so , if you so if you have trouble finding it
user interface designer : but , it is not making any sound , have we deciding ?
marketing executive :
user interface designer : so
marketing executive : but if you put your normal remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ?
user interface designer : it will make a difference . we have the better re i . my remote control is black .
marketing executive : a li little bit maybe ?
user interface designer : a little bit , but .
project manager : we p we can do it glow in the dark .
marketing executive : four ? fi
project manager : so , if it is in the dark place , you still see it glowing .
user interface designer : k .
marketing executive : i
user interface designer : fo fo five is .
marketing executive : five . it is it is it does not really make a lot of
industrial designer : then i will go for four . because four is between three and also between true and false .
user interface designer : you are right .
marketing executive : yes , but five is between four and six .
industrial designer : so i will go for four .
project manager : you must see it as , w according to the other remote controls , there may be there in your t_v _ room , this one will stand out , .
industrial designer : wha
marketing executive : b _ .
industrial designer : that is a better question actually .
project manager : exa that is what it is about .
marketing executive : it is
user interface designer : if your fifteen remotes in a drawer , you find it , ?
project manager : if it if this lying on your couch , you are you think what is that for kinda orange thing . so
marketing executive : but but the survey under users was that they really lost it .
user interface designer : that is stupid .
marketing executive : like , no not seeing it , but lost it in the house .
user interface designer : but when you lost it you are just not
marketing executive : but , .
industrial designer : if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere , then you would recognise it as , whoa , that is strange .
project manager : that is our remote control .
user interface designer : mostly when you lose your remote control , it is under your
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : what is that . ,
user interface designer : most of times when you lose it you are sitting on it .
industrial designer : so it is
marketing executive : eight , the remote control has fresh , fruity colours .
project manager : true .
user interface designer : i would call choose two , we decided not to make two f fresh colours , as it would not .
marketing executive : not too flashy . the remote control is made of soft material .
industrial designer : rubber , is soft .
project manager : but not too soft we have decided .
user interface designer : kinda soft , but not this .
marketing executive : three ?
project manager : three , .
user interface designer : easy to use ,
project manager : easy to use .
user interface designer : very afford .
marketing executive : easy to use ?
project manager : can it be zero ?
industrial designer : i don , it is
marketing executive : top easy to use ? it is it is not the most easy to use
user interface designer : you can do two , because
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : it can be easier .
user interface designer : it can be easier . but then you are l
industrial designer : it could .
marketing executive : jus just with ten buttons , that is the easiest .
user interface designer : but then you will lose function f , functionality and our fancy look , so .
industrial designer : functional ability .
marketing executive : but the most easy to use is just with one button
user interface designer : but it is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible .
marketing executive : on t , but easy n not the most easy to use , .
industrial designer : no , it is it i will go for two . my vote is on two .
marketing executive : two ?
project manager : two .
user interface designer : m mine too .
marketing executive : we also have to compare it to the remote controls on the market nowadays . so
user interface designer : but waits just a minutes .
project manager : what is the time ? we also have to do the evaluation , the production costs and .
user interface designer : these are the m regular remotes .
marketing executive : i am hurrying . the remote control is innovative .
user interface designer : yes , true , one .
project manager : you are agree , tim ?
marketing executive : a very
project manager : you have not seen a more innovative thing in paris ?
marketing executive : the remote control has m remova removable from multilux .
user interface designer : yes , one . very multifunctional .
marketing executive : the remote control , i it has speech recognition .
project manager : false .
industrial designer : yes ,
marketing executive : false .
industrial designer : it
user interface designer : this is used with speech recognition , this .
marketing executive : the remote control has built - in games ?
user interface designer : but , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub - menu and not it is not an entire game .
project manager : but they are built in , so it is one .
industrial designer : they are built in .
marketing executive : and the last , paren parental advisory function .
industrial designer : you really like the parental advisory .
project manager : freak .

user interface designer : th did you make this or the
industrial designer : bu
marketing executive : save as .
industrial designer : he made it .
user interface designer : it changes it maybe .
marketing executive : i will
user interface designer : yay .
marketing executive : do the math .
user interface designer : dear .
marketing executive : now it is your turn .
project manager : we will see .
user interface designer : ?
project manager : we have now to c to calculate the production cost . if it is under twelve and half euro , then it is . but i is it if it is b ? no , this is not right .
user interface designer : if they are under twelve fifty .
project manager : if they under . , it is
user interface designer : ?
project manager : if the costs are under twelve and a half euro , then we can ra move on to the project evaluation , as we have experienced it . otherwise , we have do have to do a little redesign thingy . so , we have to fill in the numbers of the component components . we have to fil , want to do it in and see if we stay under the twelve and a half euro . so , do we have a hand dynamo ?
industrial designer : me , too .
user interface designer : battery , yes .
project manager : battery , one ?
user interface designer : one , .
project manager : kinetic , one ?
user interface designer : kinetic , one .
industrial designer : .
project manager : solar cells , zero . , simple chip on print ?
industrial designer : n no .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : no ? no , advanced chip .
marketing executive : advanced chip .
project manager : sample sensor sample speaker ?
user interface designer : no , the advanced chip is
marketing executive : advanced chip is three .
project manager : three ?
marketing executive : three euros , .
project manager : but it is one thing , it is three euro .
industrial designer : we have one . we have one
marketing executive : one piece , .
project manager : what is the sample sensor ?
industrial designer : no , sev zero . , that is
marketing executive : speech recognition , .
user interface designer : you give it a sample , one .
industrial designer : speech recognition and s
project manager : zero . , uncurved flat .
industrial designer : a zero .
project manager : but is it s it is not made from a single uncurved thingy and then
user interface designer : you no .
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : thingy .
project manager : no ? so it is only once double - curved .
marketing executive : yes ,
user interface designer : the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the o on the back of the
marketing executive : three .
project manager : we are now in a problem , we have reached eleven euro yet .
user interface designer : we do not have anything else . so
marketing executive : go on .
project manager : but we have
industrial designer : just go on . then we will see wha how much we are over budget .
user interface designer : could you step a little to the right ma
marketing executive : two .
project manager : rubber .
user interface designer : or
project manager : you .
industrial designer : zero .
project manager : titanium , no ?
user interface designer : and zero . special is the special colour ?
project manager : special colour ?
industrial designer : i do not . no , this is a standard colour .
project manager : but we want to make the wood colours , that
marketing executive : s
industrial designer : yes , this is a special colour .
user interface designer : if you are honest , we will type one , special colour .
marketing executive : but d but daniel , tha that is another brand .
industrial designer : that is an add - on .
marketing executive : that is another article to sell .
project manager : but we going to , that is true . but , it is it
user interface designer : j maybe we will finish the list first and then look back , aye ?
marketing executive : that does not account for this . producing this .
project manager : the push - button , no .
user interface designer : scroll wheel , no .
project manager : scroll - wheel , no . , button , no . no , the
user interface designer : is it
project manager : we do not have a s
user interface designer : no .
industrial designer : these three .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : we are only four euro over budget .
project manager : . so , what is the thing we can change ?
industrial designer : but , other case , we can make it single - curved or uncurved .
project manager : can i say something ?
user interface designer : single - curves .
project manager : no , can i say something as project manager ? the kinetic thing , can we just skip it ,
user interface designer : just cut off the kine
project manager : because you have to shake it , but that is not really innovative .
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : we just put a good battery it . mobile phones nowadays .
marketing executive : daniel . daniel ,
project manager : yo .
marketing executive : what do you think about here .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : what do you think about putting a battery in it , but also selling like the covers , a docking station just apart from the thing , so that you can put
project manager :  .
marketing executive : rechargeable batteries in it and just
user interface designer : but you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual .
project manager : and not really .
marketing executive : .
project manager : but we if you forget about the kinetic ,
marketing executive : just an idea .
user interface designer : that is a cost reduc
project manager : if we do that , we shall .
industrial designer : you can go from double - curved to single - curved . and that would solve the budget problem .
project manager : b but i but the single - curved is just
user interface designer : so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then no , it is just one curve and not a back curved . or
industrial designer : it is just , the single - curve that .
project manager : so that is wh tha that is one option .
user interface designer : or are these two curves ?
project manager : and then w , and then we could have it , but it is its ' it is r it is the main point of the look .
user interface designer : but what else do we have to cut out ? no advanced chip , that is a little bit of problem .
industrial designer : we going to cut
project manager : no , tho that can be done . so ,
user interface designer : although , can we make it with a regular chip ?
project manager : a little less conversation .
user interface designer : curvy .
marketing executive : hey , those ar arcs , why are there for ? the blue
project manager : fill in just a
user interface designer : explanation .
project manager : explanation .
user interface designer : twelve fifty .
project manager : delete it for you if you want .
marketing executive : no , no .
project manager : so , if we do this , we are on twelve and a half euro . and we are done .
user interface designer : but does it fit with our design ?
project manager : the only thing that do not
user interface designer : do we have to u adapt it ? it is single - curves .
project manager : single - curved , but there is a curve in it . so
user interface designer : w could we just make the bubbles cut off the back , and then we are has
industrial designer : we just make it flat . but , you do l
marketing executive : but , wha , look , what is the if you make it double - curved , it costs one euro more .
user interface designer : more . you make it optional .
marketing executive : but no , but does it have a lot of extra
industrial designer : function .
user interface designer : functional .
marketing executive : fun function more like
industrial designer : worth , does it have added worth ?
user interface designer : there is an a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality .
industrial designer : no ,
project manager : it is really a static value .
marketing executive : aesthetic . , you make like eleven and a half euros profit instead of twelve and a half . but i if twelve and a half is a fixed price .
project manager : it is .
industrial designer : let is assume it is .
marketing executive : no , we ca not go above that .
industrial designer : we we should assume it i that it is . but i figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : r if you promote a kinetic i kinetic remote control , that would b sell better than an a normal remote control .
project manager : do you think ? , now you can shake your remote control .
marketing executive : so .
industrial designer : no , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k remote control is kinetic .
project manager : kinetic .
industrial designer : you have standard old battery control remote con
marketing executive : what a what about all the m the environment freaks ?
user interface designer : but it does not fit in our co cost profile . so
marketing executive : not freaks , the envi
industrial designer : true .
marketing executive : it look like this one .
user interface designer : you ma can make an especialised extra gold version .
project manager : who because if you want to go to kinetic , you are on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , and now it is more of a compromise thing . and if you make the single curve ha just a big curve , then it is
user interface designer : just one big curve .
project manager : one big good curve . i was going to say nasty words , but i do not . this is strange . wood is m is cheaper than rubber . we thought that wood would be more expensive .
user interface designer : this american figures . you just cut down some trees .
project manager : maybe . but that this is it ?
marketing executive : this is it .
user interface designer : whoever makes a remote control out of titanium .
project manager : i am gonna save it .
industrial designer : it is possible , but you ca not use double curves for titanium . that is one of the functionability
project manager : considering we have
marketing executive : no , we have to do all those hours again . costs on no redesign .
project manager : we were above , so we did a little redesign
user interface designer : we sue . we , we will start her all o all over again .
project manager : now it is about time to talk about this project . , some things . were there room for was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ?
marketing executive : i did not . that there was a lot of room for it . but , that is mainly because of the information that was delivered to us . it was just fixed information and get your from there , and i could not go on i on the internet and search my own . bu
project manager : that is true . i agree with that .
industrial designer : i th you two , especially you and daniel , you d you both had the less creative roles in the project .
project manager : .
user interface designer : for us , there was a lot of creativity .
industrial designer : m
user interface designer : we could just sign up an remote if we liked .
industrial designer : jeroen and i , we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than you two .
marketing executive : . , that is true .
project manager : how about the leadership ?
industrial designer : ha .
marketing executive : leadership was crappy .
user interface designer : crappy . cra
industrial designer : nah , the leadership was not crappy , it was the leader that was crappy .
project manager : very much .
industrial designer : nah . no , the leadership was .
project manager : now we are done .
user interface designer : example of crappy leadershi
marketing executive : no , leadership was
industrial designer : it was good .
marketing executive : the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . , you could have but , it was your first , no disrespect , but you could have structure it a l little bit more . so like , i was talking most of the time the first meeting , and
user interface designer : you could of said , shut up you fool .
project manager : . i notice it too . i was a i was also very unhappy , very unsatisfied about the
marketing executive : about me .
project manager : about the first meeting . so , i hope the other meetings
industrial designer : try to learn from your mistake . and we will never do it again .
marketing executive : you made up .
project manager : get better and the last two meetings also we reached some good decisions about talk
marketing executive : no , it you did better .
user interface designer : more consensus . ev everybody w was agreeing every
marketing executive : much more constructive .
project manager : so that is . , maybe that is only , it is for us , because
user interface designer : we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task .
project manager : and it is wo more like presentation and some points were discussed .
user interface designer : so , it is a little bit
project manager : but , really teamwork were you two
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : two guys .
project manager : the
industrial designer : that went w it went . it is it is just
user interface designer : stupid stupid pen , but
project manager : no hard feelings .
industrial designer : nah . , we had some trouble with the pen , but
project manager : now you must push a little while .
user interface designer : but draw something difficult .
industrial designer : but us
user interface designer : d just write your name right now . try to write your name , in writing letters , ? , normally , this the w block letter sign it , ?
project manager : o just
user interface designer : just just write your name in one line . if it is a little bit too small bit quicker now .
project manager : you can be you can go quicker , then it wo not notice it .
user interface designer : it did not he knows how it works , .
project manager : i follow the master class for the smartboard , so that is the main issue . , so about this one you were you are dealing with ,
marketing executive : means .
project manager : the digital pen .
user interface designer : y , . th the i the idea is great , but it does not work properly .
project manager : .
marketing executive : digital pen , th the first time i did individual work , i used it . but , a and the first two meetings i brought it with me , but i did not use it after the first meeting .
industrial designer : no , i have it working . but ,
marketing executive : it is it is not real use for me .
industrial designer : no , it does not have that much added value to the
user interface designer : nee . as as i said a m a c few moments ago , it i would like , myself , to write with a normal pen , because must , it is almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . i it is the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s very slow .
project manager : m . and it is still your own handwriting popping up in word .
user interface designer : yes . no , and it does not give any added value .
project manager : no , that is true .
marketing executive : not really , no .
project manager : and the smartboard is useful , but the pen is i not user - friendly , .
user interface designer : not user - friendly .
project manager : be it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things ,
user interface designer : and it is not very precise .
project manager : and that is the
user interface designer : we are trying to m to
marketing executive : like when you do this .
user interface designer : it may , and tr try to wri write your name in a normal size , .
marketing executive : smaller ?
user interface designer : smaller . just like when you are writing on a letter .
project manager : but that is not th the you when you at a foreign audience , you b do not gonna wr write small .
user interface designer : a as you saw on this drawing , just open this one or that one . it is th it , we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons , it is almost impossible to get clear when you are
project manager : but maybe there is some function with no , it is not . with
user interface designer : and the eraser was another problem . it w t is this large . and when you try to erase this line , y
project manager : i am gonna erase my name .
user interface designer : i am gonna erase my name there .
project manager : it is a big eraser .
marketing executive : new ideas ?
user interface designer : m abo what new ideas ?
project manager : the idea of the touch - screen is
marketing executive : do you ?
project manager : i am just
user interface designer : new ideas about the working of this software , about the project , about the remote controls or
marketing executive : .
project manager : i what .
user interface designer : hello .
marketing executive : did you heard what he said ? i do not i what . , i have some figure . the eva the evaluation , the mean number is one point eight six .
project manager : that is interesting .
marketing executive : so that is fairly good , .
project manager : because what does it mean ?
user interface designer : so true .
marketing executive : that
project manager : all the mo , are between one and two .
marketing executive : all the requirements are true or very true , right .
project manager : . but the new ideas found for wi with working with this software ?
user interface designer : not really , just they have to improve it .
project manager : not really , ?
user interface designer : the concept is , but it has to be quicker . , it is still opening my programme , n almo almost my entire computer is locked up during the process and it , just takes too many time . people will still feel the need to write it quickly on a page and not download it and save it , and
project manager : you had expected it to be more
user interface designer : more user - friendly . when you use a pen , you can just draw like you d draw normally , and you do
marketing executive : may maybe the idea you proposed is a screen here . and draw it , and it is placed over there .
user interface designer : that l would be easier . or at least when you do not have to adapt to the technology , just you can write in the way you normally write . and now you have to keep constantly in mind that you are drawing on this screen .
marketing executive : ?
user interface designer : and that is a very bad concept .
marketing executive : very bad .
user interface designer : nah , i it is my opinion that i
marketing executive : this is better than regular flip - overs ,
user interface designer : it is can be saved easier . but if you are in normal flip - over you a lot of people write text . there is no text option . and writing text , you have got ta really do your best to write some
project manager : and maybe some functions for circle or a square . you have to draw it yourself now .
user interface designer : or maybe even insert picture . if you have some presentation , and you have some f
industrial designer : or text function . just t type text , and that would be excellent . mean
marketing executive : but insert image is not available ?
user interface designer : then you could
marketing executive : here . picture from scanner , clip - art .
project manager : that can be done already . but not the predefined squares
user interface designer : so you can
marketing executive : hyperlink ? hey , what if you do like hyperlink ?
user interface designer : with w_w _ dot google dot com .
marketing executive : type type it ?
user interface designer : maybe .
marketing executive : re real reaction dot n_l _ . yes , is now is .
user interface designer : you will just make a link in
project manager : that is .
user interface designer : there is one way to
project manager : is it
marketing executive : double - click it .
user interface designer : maybe if you are not using the eraser
project manager : here .
marketing executive : you are erasing .
user interface designer : something else th , arrow .
project manager : .
marketing executive : double - click it .
project manager : so you have
user interface designer : it is
project manager : as you saw , you have a little , you can you can go there . so there the functionality is there , but it is not ideal , and it is very it costs a lot of time to
user interface designer : to use , .
project manager : to use . and that is a pity , if you have thirty , forty minutes for this things , and we are now with four people ,
user interface designer : and that is m
project manager : but it , imagine you are here you are with the ten people and everyone
user interface designer : that is mostly the case , from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case , and if you have to do all this kind
project manager : two minutes of drawing , .
user interface designer : you will rather use powerpoint and work it out in advance . and th the one or two things you have to draw when you are there , just use a flip - board .
marketing executive : what i really miss also is a d is a turtle is a decision system like with the evaluation , you have to polls like , what do you want , a one , a two , maybe a l a little application like give your own number and click one two three four five six seven .
project manager : just like he said with the a screen which you can write , also a voting mechanism .
marketing executive : j ju , v voting application . just a little group decision application .
industrial designer : but , problem is , you ca not discuss anything you ca you can , but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now . we w one person s maybe said three . but , i we said , no i w th think two , because this and this , and then you can react on it . but if you put a three on it , just figure , everybody knows what i am knowing , so they will all just put a two on .
marketing executive : . but , you can still discuss about it ,
industrial designer : but it would .
marketing executive : but click it in an application , that is a lot easier to process .
industrial designer : the for processing part .
marketing executive : the digit .
industrial designer : but then , the idea of one person entering it and the rest discussing it , that is not that bad idea , actually . not that your opinion is not valued , but still .
project manager : so
user interface designer : yo , manager .
marketing executive : that is it ?
project manager : just about ,
user interface designer : when are w
project manager : because
user interface designer : when are we going to produce it ?
project manager : tomorrow ? , the costs are within the budget .
marketing executive : celebration .
project manager : the project is evaluated . but , before we going to celebrate , i have a little question which you ca not answer , because there must be some end report . i am busy with the end report right now . you might thinking what the hell was he doing
marketing executive : what is an end report ?
project manager : about all the meetings , what we have decided , a r a report of this day . , that must be made , but i , here is standing whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is
marketing executive : you ha you have ten minutes left , i read . you have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report .
project manager : that can be done . maybe we can do it together . you can see what i have so i s i will put it on a story - board . you can see it . because it will it must be
marketing executive : you you already made a beta version , or
project manager : it is a three with seventy five
marketing executive : pages .
project manager : just about .
industrial designer : y yikes . seventy five pages .
project manager : just a moment .
marketing executive : daniel . do you want a chair maybe ?
user interface designer : a chairman .
project manager : no no ,
marketing executive : hey ?
project manager : you can s you can read it and here it is .
industrial designer : so you finished it actually , and so we just have to read it and say yes or no ?
project manager : this not nit it read - only . but it is not fully finished yet .
marketing executive : five minutes for finishing .
project manager : this is about the functional design , the things .
marketing executive : management expert , you have to change that .
project manager : i am when i said it , i remember i had it here .
marketing executive : marketing .
user interface designer : it is a read - only version .
marketing executive : but you can save it u the under another name .
project manager : marketing expert , about the three functions where which are most used and which must immediately be visible on our remote control . , it must be simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people . so , this is really about wh what kind things must be in it and
marketing executive : maybe the
project manager : i understand you , talk a little bit dutch .
marketing executive : the you . no , you have to put , switch channels at the top , because that is the most used function and teletext at the second
project manager : oka , i really did not knew that .
marketing executive : nay , a volume changing , second .
project manager : so , this one is first .
marketing executive : s switch , yes .
project manager : you go there and you go there .
marketing executive : go on .
project manager : maybe then do it one two three .
marketing executive : yes , very good .
user interface designer : one two three .
project manager : if the order is in is important , that is the word for .
marketing executive : the order .
project manager : then the conceptual design . , all the things we have discussed , the energy , which turn out to be batteries , so that is
user interface designer : maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost .
project manager : because . , he here it is still double - curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable .
marketing executive : single - curves .
project manager : the buttons
industrial designer : it is not double .
user interface designer : a single - curved .
industrial designer : it is not double anymore , ?
project manager : not double anymore .
marketing executive : no , .
project manager : nay but that this is what
marketing executive : was initial , the plan . the initial plan .
project manager : and the added functions like tetris snake , it is under the parental control , the touch - screen . so , it is just a summary of what we had discussed
industrial designer : on thing one small thing , the added functions . , was it included in the cost ?
user interface designer : it is very cheap .
project manager : it is very cheap ,
industrial designer : it is very cheap .
project manager : you maybe you come at
marketing executive : no , it is not very cheap , but that
project manager : it is very necessary .
marketing executive : no , but it is a development inside corporation . like , w we do not have to buy parental control . our own people can make that , .
project manager : but it still has some
marketing executive : it has some cost , but
project manager : . , but so we can discuss that
user interface designer : he will do it in his free time . so
project manager : we can discuss that things with the board of
user interface designer : of directur or directors .
project manager : what is it what is the company called ? keep forgetting it .
marketing executive : real reaction .
project manager : real reaction . real reaction , .
user interface designer : you can ask your personal
project manager : so anybody misses something here about
user interface designer : the end conclusion .
project manager : that is what i am gonna write b between now .
marketing executive : . still the end conclusion . that is all , .
project manager : but , i in here nothing
user interface designer : the decision to make the buttons on the top , and the menu on the
project manager :  .
user interface designer : on the bottom . and clearly , touch - screen you have mentioned .
project manager : touch - screen i have mentioned .
marketing executive : but the decisions are put in the conclusion , . why we decided to use a flat l_c_d _ .
user interface designer : this n .
project manager : i gonna redesign something now .
user interface designer : party party .
project manager : because it will , five minutes from to finish meeting .
user interface designer : before you change anything maybe you save it first .
marketing executive : save it .
user interface designer : you ca not you can select file and export and then those j _ peg files .
marketing executive : but then you had the same thing .
user interface designer : eight . and we have , another blank one .
marketing executive : example of children remote .

user interface designer : saved ?
industrial designer : hereby is the meeting is finished .
marketing executive : you declare .
project manager : i am the one who can say that . hereby the meeting is finished .","the project manager opened the meeting and went over the agenda . the user interface designer and the industrial designer presented their prototype design , describing the shape and layout of the remote . the group discussed colour options and decided to make the standard remote in fruity colours , but with the option of buying different exchangeable covers which might appeal more to older buyers . the marketing expert led the prototype evaluation and the group were happy with their product . the group calculated the production costs . the group were 4 euros over budget , so they decided to make the case single-curved and not to use kinetic energy . the project manager led the evaluation of the project process . the group felt that only the industrial designer and the user interface designer were able to be creative and work as a team . it was felt that the first meeting was disorganised because of poor leadership but the leadership improved in the later meetings . the group were also had problems with the digital pens . the group helped the project manager fill in the final report before the close of the meeting . the project manager will finish the final report . the remote will come in fruity colours as standard with the option of buying different exchangeable covers . the case will be single-curved instead of double-curved . the remote will be battery powered and will no longer use kinetic energy . the production costs were 4 euros over budget . which features should be changed to reduce production costs . there were not enough opportunities for creativity and teamwork . the digital pens did not work very well .
","the project manager opened the meeting and then the user interface designer and the industrial designer presented a prototype for the remote which featured a single touch-screen interface . the prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). the team evaluated the prototype on the basis of its appearance , technological innovation , ease of use , sponginess , usefulness , its ability to be misplaced , its ability to hide menu items , and its ability to meet the appropriate demographic . overall , the prototype performed quite well in the evaluation . the marketing expert led an evaluation of the project process , which indicated that the group was quite happy with the tools available to them . the group evaluated the project process in terms of creativity , leadership , teamwork , information technology , and budget management . the group were generally satisfied with the tools available to them . the project manager will fill out an evaluation of the project process . the group will fill out an evaluation of the project process . the group was generally satisfied with the tools available to them . the group was quite happy with the tools available to them . the project manager will fill out an evaluation of the project process . the group was generally satisfied with the tools available to them . the group was quite happy with the",x,x,,,x,,,,5.0,Pegasus-Cons
68,"project manager : would not wanna be project manager . , what we going to do . , once again i am gonna take minutes . so , no presentation for me . , first we have a prototype presentation by g _ and g _ . afterwards some
user interface designer : yo .
marketing executive : j _ and j _ .
project manager : eval evalu
industrial designer : evaluation .
project manager : evaluation
user interface designer : evaluation criteria .
marketing executive : evaluation .
project manager : s . evaluation crit criteria . , in combination with the finance i received a an excel file which we have to fill in later on . , and then we must see if we stay under the twelve and a half euro .
marketing executive : .
project manager : so , that is a big
industrial designer :  . that is gonna be t problem .
project manager : l so let is it we have must ,
user interface designer : some creative
project manager : we must have some time for that because it will be , quite a lot of mathematics .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and after that , an evaluation of the process how we have done it here with the smartboard , with the with our laptops , with the all this . and afterwards , we closing . once again , forty minutes , so let is start . i would g give the word to g _ and g _ for the prototype presentation .
user interface designer : shall i give a short introduction and then
industrial designer : .
project manager : j _ and j _ .
user interface designer : j _ and j _ , .
marketing executive : jane and jane . guys , take it away .
user interface designer : take it away .
industrial designer : hi .
user interface designer : this was our first concept . we decided to use a single touch - screen . so , we have worked out this concepts , how to hold it , where to put the buttons and . and , we began with a form of shape , that is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed . so , we made i it a little bit less thick and it has some ar artistic meaning . this is not nothing . idea maybe is better . , during the meeting i showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and the menu structure , if necessary , with your other hand , so it is just gonna hold it easily . and it has to be acce accessible with your other hand too , . so we began working out a concept .
industrial designer : and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel l_c_d _ screen . , these would be the main buttons , h you could change them later on in your own profile if you want to . but , it is standard they will be delivered with this set - up . we have the more advanced menu setting right here . we have the sub - menus and stu . we made a top , or a front view . just so like you wanna back view . as you can see , this there , there are two weird bumps in it . this is for the added effect of y youth and dynamic . and this is for the artistic effect . , what we figured is we will show you a picture later on you have more b a better idea after that . but , idea is for to stay in balance with these two . and so when you put it on the table , it will just lay down . it wo not roll around or . but it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , or like these old phones . y you may get the idea . so thi this is about how we figured it should be . the s panel we g you would hide with some more rubber layers , like we discussed early on . , you would s you would not see the straight panel , but more fluidly and round .
user interface designer : the panel just goes like this . but the overlaying layer is a little bit curved and .
project manager : no , .
industrial designer : and , in these bumps you could actually put some electronics that would you can make a more thinner design , and that would actually look very , . and , about the colour , what have
user interface designer : we added that this can be held with your hands for this maximum is om , one and a half centimetres . so , you have room here for your battery and maybe even other electronic chips . s and you can just be the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as thin as possible in the middle for good grip .
industrial designer : f , as colours , do you have the picture in now , this is the idea about the bumps . , you can see there is a v a very youthful dynamic exterior . it you just want to hold it you are young and dynamic like us .
marketing executive : is l it is like an easter egg .
industrial designer : it is like an e but this is for children . we we want a more adult version . but , this is like a remote control for children .
project manager : it is called a weemote
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : weemote .
project manager : weemote .
industrial designer : hey , that is actually a brilliant marketing stand . , but
marketing executive : what i w got in mind .
industrial designer : so this actually basic the idea . we we just want to build a more adult vers adult version of this .
project manager : imagine that .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : and and for colours , we figured starting with basic colours like white or metallic grey . those are the technological colours actually ,
user interface designer : it would be best to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable ,
industrial designer : so it d
user interface designer : so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple ,
industrial designer : or blue or whatever .
user interface designer : but when the o older people go in the shop and they see an orange remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one . and young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , they think , i will buy for a couple of euros some noi hip
marketing executive : maybe it is an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the shop .
user interface designer : a cover is necessary , als otherwise you will just have the l_c_d _ screen .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : so , there must be some cheap standard cover , maybe white ,
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : that is could comes with it and you can buy , so we can make extra money .
project manager : but you d you must not forget that our target aim is younger people .
marketing executive : oui .
project manager : we had decided to put some flashy fruity colours in it , and in the survey from milan and paris it came out that the d the older people are more willing to spend money on extra features . so it will be a better idea to have some flashy fruity colours as a standard ,
user interface designer : the other way around , you mean .
project manager : and for the people who really want a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they are willing to pay that . they want they want more luxury , but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : so , maybe it is an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard .
industrial designer : . , maybe , perhaps you are right . , i would actually agree with this sounds logical .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : an another idea . , maybe we could develop a cover with wood style . they will the elder users as .
user interface designer : a colour of a wood style , a white c and a couple of h hip fruity colours . and lea l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too much .
industrial designer : nah .
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : this is banana and mango , not purple or p orange and yellow .
marketing executive : exactly .
project manager : but , the mai th the standard must be some attractive flashy colours .
marketing executive : . or blue or
project manager : not too , but w a little ,
user interface designer : .
project manager : because that is our aim .
industrial designer : li like this . this is not this is not too much , is it ?
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : i f
project manager : the buttons do not have to be all of
industrial designer : . the buttons ,
marketing executive : so .
industrial designer : i
marketing executive : except for the buttons it is it could be a standard model .
project manager : it
industrial designer : something like this would be . , that is it from us .
marketing executive : it is my time now .
user interface designer : it is my turn .
project manager : the marketing expert .
industrial designer : uh - oh .
marketing executive : during the design life - cycle we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and . , now is the time to evaluate our prototype concept to the past requirements . so we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis . , we are going to do that with a seven point scale . opening a word document now . one , i have to expla explain something . we have to be consensive about things . so , it has to be a group decision .
project manager :
marketing executive : ?
project manager : so we gon we gonna evaluate the
marketing executive : we are going to vote . we
project manager : the thing we saw .
marketing executive : ? the prototype .
project manager : just saw .
marketing executive : one . the remote control is designed for people with age below forty .
project manager : .
marketing executive : seven is false .
project manager : true .
marketing executive : b one or
project manager : one .
industrial designer : why ?
marketing executive : most true ?
industrial designer : it is not just designed for people under the age of forty . it is also designed for people above forty .
marketing executive : so
industrial designer : so
marketing executive : so a o one is appropriate ?
user interface designer : no no , a little more in the middle .
marketing executive : or , more like a four .
user interface designer : no , three or .
industrial designer : i have i have
marketing executive : three .
industrial designer : two or three , because it is not just the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty . but it is also designed for people of age above forty . so ,
marketing executive : exactly .
industrial designer : i will say it is about three .
user interface designer : it will be primary appealing to m minus forty , but also appealing to
marketing executive : but also for , . the remote control is beautiful .
user interface designer : it is
marketing executive : acco according to us , it is one ? or
user interface designer : it is the marketing angle on television . we have a wonderful
marketing executive : p s of c you have to be very positive and enthusiastic about your own product .
user interface designer : it is also fancy then .
marketing executive : the remote control looks fancy .
industrial designer : yes .
marketing executive : one ?
user interface designer : . we have a perfect remote .
marketing executive : good . the remote control has big , clear channel switching buttons .
user interface designer : yes . they have to agree but
project manager : yes .
industrial designer : leads to user face , .
user interface designer : i am the user interface expert .
marketing executive : daniel . , teletext buttons and volume buttons ?
user interface designer : no .
project manager : no teletext buttons . teletext is in the menu .
user interface designer : you you have different menu .
industrial designer : false .
marketing executive : false ?
user interface designer : and volume is impo
marketing executive : and volume ?
project manager : volume is true .
marketing executive : true . big and clear ?
industrial designer : the they are big and clear .
user interface designer : big and clear .
project manager : big and clear .
user interface designer : but you could make a teletext button six .
marketing executive : hey .
user interface designer : otherwise , the people who read this are gonna think we have no teletext button .
marketing executive : hide .
industrial designer : but the teletext button . , you can ch that is in a menu .
marketing executive : it is it is not
industrial designer : so , it is w , it
marketing executive : it
industrial designer : it is not entirely unclear ,
marketing executive : j
industrial designer : but so , i would not give it a seven .
user interface designer : no .
industrial designer : i would give it a more a five or a six .
marketing executive : five ?
industrial designer : i don i . what do you think , mister project manager ?
marketing executive : it is .
project manager : . i was thinking very black and white .
user interface designer : black and red .
project manager : j _ .
user interface designer : do not forget to save it .
marketing executive : red . the remote control is easy to be found .
user interface designer : when we put in fancy colours ,
project manager : fruity .
user interface designer : and
industrial designer : it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape . so , if you so if you have trouble finding it
user interface designer : but , it is not making any sound , have we deciding ?
marketing executive :
user interface designer : so
marketing executive : but if you put your normal remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ?
user interface designer : it will make a difference . we have the better re i . my remote control is black .
marketing executive : a li little bit maybe ?
user interface designer : a little bit , but .
project manager : we p we can do it glow in the dark .
marketing executive : four ? fi
project manager : so , if it is in the dark place , you still see it glowing .
user interface designer : k .
marketing executive : i
user interface designer : fo fo five is .
marketing executive : five . it is it is it does not really make a lot of
industrial designer : then i will go for four . because four is between three and also between true and false .
user interface designer : you are right .
marketing executive : yes , but five is between four and six .
industrial designer : so i will go for four .
project manager : you must see it as , w according to the other remote controls , there may be there in your t_v _ room , this one will stand out , .
industrial designer : wha

industrial designer : that is a better question actually .
project manager : exa that is what it is about .
marketing executive : it is

user interface designer : that is stupid .
marketing executive : like , no not seeing it , but lost it in the house .
user interface designer : but when you lost it you are just not
marketing executive : but , .
industrial designer : if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere , then you would recognise it as , whoa , that is strange .
project manager : that is our remote control .
user interface designer : mostly when you lose your remote control , it is under your
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : what is that . ,
user interface designer : most of times when you lose it you are sitting on it .
industrial designer : so it is
marketing executive : eight , the remote control has fresh , fruity colours .
project manager : true .
user interface designer : i would call choose two , we decided not to make two f fresh colours , as it would not .
marketing executive : not too flashy . the remote control is made of soft material .
industrial designer : rubber , is soft .
project manager : but not too soft we have decided .
user interface designer : kinda soft , but not this .
marketing executive : three ?
project manager : three , .
user interface designer : easy to use ,
project manager : easy to use .
user interface designer : very afford .
marketing executive : easy to use ?
project manager : can it be zero ?
industrial designer : i don , it is
marketing executive : top easy to use ? it is it is not the most easy to use
user interface designer : you can do two , because
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : it can be easier .
user interface designer : it can be easier . but then you are l
industrial designer : it could .
marketing executive : jus just with ten buttons , that is the easiest .
user interface designer : but then you will lose function f , functionality and our fancy look , so .
industrial designer : functional ability .
marketing executive : but the most easy to use is just with one button
user interface designer : but it is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible .
marketing executive : on t , but easy n not the most easy to use , .
industrial designer : no , it is it i will go for two . my vote is on two .
marketing executive : two ?
project manager : two .
user interface designer : m mine too .
marketing executive : we also have to compare it to the remote controls on the market nowadays . so
user interface designer : but waits just a minutes .
project manager : what is the time ? we also have to do the evaluation , the production costs and .
user interface designer : these are the m regular remotes .
marketing executive : i am hurrying . the remote control is innovative .
user interface designer : yes , true , one .
project manager : you are agree , tim ?
marketing executive : a very
project manager : you have not seen a more innovative thing in paris ?
marketing executive : the remote control has m remova removable from multilux .
user interface designer : yes , one . very multifunctional .
marketing executive : the remote control , i it has speech recognition .
project manager : false .
industrial designer : yes ,
marketing executive : false .
industrial designer : it
user interface designer : this is used with speech recognition , this .
marketing executive : the remote control has built - in games ?
user interface designer : but , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub - menu and not it is not an entire game .
project manager : but they are built in , so it is one .
industrial designer : they are built in .
marketing executive : and the last , paren parental advisory function .
industrial designer : you really like the parental advisory .

industrial designer : bu
marketing executive : save as .
industrial designer : he made it .
user interface designer : it changes it maybe .
marketing executive : i will
user interface designer : yay .
marketing executive : do the math .
user interface designer : dear .
marketing executive : now it is your turn .
project manager : we will see .
user interface designer : ?
project manager : we have now to c to calculate the production cost . if it is under twelve and half euro , then it is . but i is it if it is b ? no , this is not right .
user interface designer : if they are under twelve fifty .
project manager : if they under . , it is
user interface designer : ?
project manager : if the costs are under twelve and a half euro , then we can ra move on to the project evaluation , as we have experienced it . otherwise , we have do have to do a little redesign thingy . so , we have to fill in the numbers of the component components . we have to fil , want to do it in and see if we stay under the twelve and a half euro . so , do we have a hand dynamo ?
industrial designer : me , too .
user interface designer : battery , yes .
project manager : battery , one ?
user interface designer : one , .
project manager : kinetic , one ?
user interface designer : kinetic , one .
industrial designer : .
project manager : solar cells , zero . , simple chip on print ?
industrial designer : n no .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : no ? no , advanced chip .
marketing executive : advanced chip .
project manager : sample sensor sample speaker ?
user interface designer : no , the advanced chip is
marketing executive : advanced chip is three .
project manager : three ?
marketing executive : three euros , .
project manager : but it is one thing , it is three euro .
industrial designer : we have one . we have one
marketing executive : one piece , .
project manager : what is the sample sensor ?
industrial designer : no , sev zero . , that is
marketing executive : speech recognition , .
user interface designer : you give it a sample , one .
industrial designer : speech recognition and s
project manager : zero . , uncurved flat .
industrial designer : a zero .
project manager : but is it s it is not made from a single uncurved thingy and then
user interface designer : you no .
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : thingy .
project manager : no ? so it is only once double - curved .
marketing executive : yes ,
user interface designer : the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the o on the back of the
marketing executive : three .
project manager : we are now in a problem , we have reached eleven euro yet .
user interface designer : we do not have anything else . so
marketing executive : go on .
project manager : but we have
industrial designer : just go on . then we will see wha how much we are over budget .
user interface designer : could you step a little to the right ma
marketing executive : two .
project manager : rubber .
user interface designer : or
project manager : you .
industrial designer : zero .
project manager : titanium , no ?
user interface designer : and zero . special is the special colour ?
project manager : special colour ?
industrial designer : i do not . no , this is a standard colour .
project manager : but we want to make the wood colours , that
marketing executive : s
industrial designer : yes , this is a special colour .
user interface designer : if you are honest , we will type one , special colour .
marketing executive : but d but daniel , tha that is another brand .
industrial designer : that is an add - on .
marketing executive : that is another article to sell .
project manager : but we going to , that is true . but , it is it
user interface designer : j maybe we will finish the list first and then look back , aye ?
marketing executive : that does not account for this . producing this .
project manager : the push - button , no .
user interface designer : scroll wheel , no .
project manager : scroll - wheel , no . , button , no . no , the
user interface designer : is it
project manager : we do not have a s
user interface designer : no .
industrial designer : these three .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : we are only four euro over budget .
project manager : . so , what is the thing we can change ?
industrial designer : but , other case , we can make it single - curved or uncurved .
project manager : can i say something ?
user interface designer : single - curves .
project manager : no , can i say something as project manager ? the kinetic thing , can we just skip it ,
user interface designer : just cut off the kine
project manager : because you have to shake it , but that is not really innovative .
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : we just put a good battery it . mobile phones nowadays .
marketing executive : daniel . daniel ,
project manager : yo .
marketing executive : what do you think about here .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : what do you think about putting a battery in it , but also selling like the covers , a docking station just apart from the thing , so that you can put
project manager :  .
marketing executive : rechargeable batteries in it and just
user interface designer : but you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual .
project manager : and not really .
marketing executive : .
project manager : but we if you forget about the kinetic ,
marketing executive : just an idea .
user interface designer : that is a cost reduc
project manager : if we do that , we shall .
industrial designer : you can go from double - curved to single - curved . and that would solve the budget problem .
project manager : b but i but the single - curved is just
user interface designer : so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then no , it is just one curve and not a back curved . or
industrial designer : it is just , the single - curve that .
project manager : so that is wh tha that is one option .
user interface designer : or are these two curves ?
project manager : and then w , and then we could have it , but it is its ' it is r it is the main point of the look .
user interface designer : but what else do we have to cut out ? no advanced chip , that is a little bit of problem .
industrial designer : we going to cut
project manager : no , tho that can be done . so ,
user interface designer : although , can we make it with a regular chip ?
project manager : a little less conversation .
user interface designer : curvy .
marketing executive : hey , those ar arcs , why are there for ? the blue
project manager : fill in just a
user interface designer : explanation .
project manager : explanation .
user interface designer : twelve fifty .
project manager : delete it for you if you want .
marketing executive : no , no .
project manager : so , if we do this , we are on twelve and a half euro . and we are done .
user interface designer : but does it fit with our design ?
project manager : the only thing that do not
user interface designer : do we have to u adapt it ? it is single - curves .
project manager : single - curved , but there is a curve in it . so
user interface designer : w could we just make the bubbles cut off the back , and then we are has
industrial designer : we just make it flat . but , you do l
marketing executive : but , wha , look , what is the if you make it double - curved , it costs one euro more .
user interface designer : more . you make it optional .
marketing executive : but no , but does it have a lot of extra
industrial designer : function .
user interface designer : functional .
marketing executive : fun function more like
industrial designer : worth , does it have added worth ?
user interface designer : there is an a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality .
industrial designer : no ,
project manager : it is really a static value .
marketing executive : aesthetic . , you make like eleven and a half euros profit instead of twelve and a half . but i if twelve and a half is a fixed price .
project manager : it is .
industrial designer : let is assume it is .
marketing executive : no , we ca not go above that .
industrial designer : we we should assume it i that it is . but i figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : r if you promote a kinetic i kinetic remote control , that would b sell better than an a normal remote control .
project manager : do you think ? , now you can shake your remote control .
marketing executive : so .
industrial designer : no , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k remote control is kinetic .
project manager : kinetic .
industrial designer : you have standard old battery control remote con
marketing executive : what a what about all the m the environment freaks ?
user interface designer : but it does not fit in our co cost profile . so
marketing executive : not freaks , the envi
industrial designer : true .
marketing executive : it look like this one .
user interface designer : you ma can make an especialised extra gold version .
project manager : who because if you want to go to kinetic , you are on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , and now it is more of a compromise thing . and if you make the single curve ha just a big curve , then it is
user interface designer : just one big curve .
project manager : one big good curve . i was going to say nasty words , but i do not . this is strange . wood is m is cheaper than rubber . we thought that wood would be more expensive .
user interface designer : this american figures . you just cut down some trees .
project manager : maybe . but that this is it ?
marketing executive : this is it .
user interface designer : whoever makes a remote control out of titanium .
project manager : i am gonna save it .
industrial designer : it is possible , but you ca not use double curves for titanium . that is one of the functionability
project manager : considering we have
marketing executive : no , we have to do all those hours again . costs on no redesign .
project manager : we were above , so we did a little redesign
user interface designer : we sue . we , we will start her all o all over again .
project manager : now it is about time to talk about this project . , some things . were there room for was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ?
marketing executive : i did not . that there was a lot of room for it . but , that is mainly because of the information that was delivered to us . it was just fixed information and get your from there , and i could not go on i on the internet and search my own . bu
project manager : that is true . i agree with that .
industrial designer : i th you two , especially you and daniel , you d you both had the less creative roles in the project .
project manager : .
user interface designer : for us , there was a lot of creativity .
industrial designer : m
user interface designer : we could just sign up an remote if we liked .
industrial designer : jeroen and i , we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than you two .
marketing executive : . , that is true .
project manager : how about the leadership ?
industrial designer : ha .
marketing executive : leadership was crappy .
user interface designer : crappy . cra
industrial designer : nah , the leadership was not crappy , it was the leader that was crappy .
project manager : very much .
industrial designer : nah . no , the leadership was .
project manager : now we are done .
user interface designer : example of crappy leadershi
marketing executive : no , leadership was
industrial designer : it was good .
marketing executive : the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . , you could have but , it was your first , no disrespect , but you could have structure it a l little bit more . so like , i was talking most of the time the first meeting , and
user interface designer : you could of said , shut up you fool .
project manager : . i notice it too . i was a i was also very unhappy , very unsatisfied about the
marketing executive : about me .
project manager : about the first meeting . so , i hope the other meetings
industrial designer : try to learn from your mistake . and we will never do it again .
marketing executive : you made up .
project manager : get better and the last two meetings also we reached some good decisions about talk
marketing executive : no , it you did better .
user interface designer : more consensus . ev everybody w was agreeing every
marketing executive : much more constructive .
project manager : so that is . , maybe that is only , it is for us , because
user interface designer : we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task .
project manager : and it is wo more like presentation and some points were discussed .
user interface designer : so , it is a little bit
project manager : but , really teamwork were you two
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : two guys .
project manager : the
industrial designer : that went w it went . it is it is just
user interface designer : stupid stupid pen , but
project manager : no hard feelings .
industrial designer : nah . , we had some trouble with the pen , but
project manager : now you must push a little while .
user interface designer : but draw something difficult .
industrial designer : but us
user interface designer : d just write your name right now . try to write your name , in writing letters , ? , normally , this the w block letter sign it , ?
project manager : o just
user interface designer : just just write your name in one line . if it is a little bit too small bit quicker now .
project manager : you can be you can go quicker , then it wo not notice it .
user interface designer : it did not he knows how it works , .
project manager : i follow the master class for the smartboard , so that is the main issue . , so about this one you were you are dealing with ,
marketing executive : means .
project manager : the digital pen .
user interface designer : y , . th the i the idea is great , but it does not work properly .
project manager : .
marketing executive : digital pen , th the first time i did individual work , i used it . but , a and the first two meetings i brought it with me , but i did not use it after the first meeting .
industrial designer : no , i have it working . but ,
marketing executive : it is it is not real use for me .
industrial designer : no , it does not have that much added value to the
user interface designer : nee . as as i said a m a c few moments ago , it i would like , myself , to write with a normal pen , because must , it is almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . i it is the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s very slow .
project manager : m . and it is still your own handwriting popping up in word .
user interface designer : yes . no , and it does not give any added value .
project manager : no , that is true .
marketing executive : not really , no .
project manager : and the smartboard is useful , but the pen is i not user - friendly , .
user interface designer : not user - friendly .
project manager : be it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things ,
user interface designer : and it is not very precise .
project manager : and that is the
user interface designer : we are trying to m to
marketing executive : like when you do this .
user interface designer : it may , and tr try to wri write your name in a normal size , .
marketing executive : smaller ?
user interface designer : smaller . just like when you are writing on a letter .
project manager : but that is not th the you when you at a foreign audience , you b do not gonna wr write small .
user interface designer : a as you saw on this drawing , just open this one or that one . it is th it , we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons , it is almost impossible to get clear when you are
project manager : but maybe there is some function with no , it is not . with
user interface designer : and the eraser was another problem . it w t is this large . and when you try to erase this line , y
project manager : i am gonna erase my name .
user interface designer : i am gonna erase my name there .
project manager : it is a big eraser .
marketing executive : new ideas ?
user interface designer : m abo what new ideas ?
project manager : the idea of the touch - screen is
marketing executive : do you ?
project manager : i am just
user interface designer : new ideas about the working of this software , about the project , about the remote controls or
marketing executive : .
project manager : i what .
user interface designer : hello .
marketing executive : did you heard what he said ? i do not i what . , i have some figure . the eva the evaluation , the mean number is one point eight six .
project manager : that is interesting .
marketing executive : so that is fairly good , .
project manager : because what does it mean ?
user interface designer : so true .
marketing executive : that
project manager : all the mo , are between one and two .
marketing executive : all the requirements are true or very true , right .
project manager : . but the new ideas found for wi with working with this software ?
user interface designer : not really , just they have to improve it .
project manager : not really , ?
user interface designer : the concept is , but it has to be quicker . , it is still opening my programme , n almo almost my entire computer is locked up during the process and it , just takes too many time . people will still feel the need to write it quickly on a page and not download it and save it , and
project manager : you had expected it to be more
user interface designer : more user - friendly . when you use a pen , you can just draw like you d draw normally , and you do
marketing executive : may maybe the idea you proposed is a screen here . and draw it , and it is placed over there .
user interface designer : that l would be easier . or at least when you do not have to adapt to the technology , just you can write in the way you normally write . and now you have to keep constantly in mind that you are drawing on this screen .
marketing executive : ?
user interface designer : and that is a very bad concept .
marketing executive : very bad .
user interface designer : nah , i it is my opinion that i
marketing executive : this is better than regular flip - overs ,
user interface designer : it is can be saved easier . but if you are in normal flip - over you a lot of people write text . there is no text option . and writing text , you have got ta really do your best to write some
project manager : and maybe some functions for circle or a square . you have to draw it yourself now .
user interface designer : or maybe even insert picture . if you have some presentation , and you have some f
industrial designer : or text function . just t type text , and that would be excellent . mean
marketing executive : but insert image is not available ?
user interface designer : then you could
marketing executive : here . picture from scanner , clip - art .
project manager : that can be done already . but not the predefined squares
user interface designer : so you can
marketing executive : hyperlink ? hey , what if you do like hyperlink ?
user interface designer : with w_w _ dot google dot com .
marketing executive : type type it ?
user interface designer : maybe .
marketing executive : re real reaction dot n_l _ . yes , is now is .
user interface designer : you will just make a link in
project manager : that is .
user interface designer : there is one way to
project manager : is it
marketing executive : double - click it .
user interface designer : maybe if you are not using the eraser
project manager : here .
marketing executive : you are erasing .
user interface designer : something else th , arrow .
project manager : .
marketing executive : double - click it .
project manager : so you have
user interface designer : it is
project manager : as you saw , you have a little , you can you can go there . so there the functionality is there , but it is not ideal , and it is very it costs a lot of time to
user interface designer : to use , .
project manager : to use . and that is a pity , if you have thirty , forty minutes for this things , and we are now with four people ,
user interface designer : and that is m
project manager : but it , imagine you are here you are with the ten people and everyone
user interface designer : that is mostly the case , from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case , and if you have to do all this kind
project manager : two minutes of drawing , .
user interface designer : you will rather use powerpoint and work it out in advance . and th the one or two things you have to draw when you are there , just use a flip - board .
marketing executive : what i really miss also is a d is a turtle is a decision system like with the evaluation , you have to polls like , what do you want , a one , a two , maybe a l a little application like give your own number and click one two three four five six seven .
project manager : just like he said with the a screen which you can write , also a voting mechanism .
marketing executive : j ju , v voting application . just a little group decision application .
industrial designer : but , problem is , you ca not discuss anything you ca you can , but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now . we w one person s maybe said three . but , i we said , no i w th think two , because this and this , and then you can react on it . but if you put a three on it , just figure , everybody knows what i am knowing , so they will all just put a two on .
marketing executive : . but , you can still discuss about it ,
industrial designer : but it would .
marketing executive : but click it in an application , that is a lot easier to process .
industrial designer : the for processing part .
marketing executive : the digit .
industrial designer : but then , the idea of one person entering it and the rest discussing it , that is not that bad idea , actually . not that your opinion is not valued , but still .
project manager : so
user interface designer : yo , manager .
marketing executive : that is it ?
project manager : just about ,
user interface designer : when are w
project manager : because
user interface designer : when are we going to produce it ?
project manager : tomorrow ? , the costs are within the budget .
marketing executive : celebration .
project manager : the project is evaluated . but , before we going to celebrate , i have a little question which you ca not answer , because there must be some end report . i am busy with the end report right now . you might thinking what the hell was he doing
marketing executive : what is an end report ?
project manager : about all the meetings , what we have decided , a r a report of this day . , that must be made , but i , here is standing whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is
marketing executive : you ha you have ten minutes left , i read . you have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report .
project manager : that can be done . maybe we can do it together . you can see what i have so i s i will put it on a story - board . you can see it . because it will it must be
marketing executive : you you already made a beta version , or
project manager : it is a three with seventy five
marketing executive : pages .
project manager : just about .
industrial designer : y yikes . seventy five pages .
project manager : just a moment .
marketing executive : daniel . do you want a chair maybe ?
user interface designer : a chairman .
project manager : no no ,
marketing executive : hey ?
project manager : you can s you can read it and here it is .
industrial designer : so you finished it actually , and so we just have to read it and say yes or no ?
project manager : this not nit it read - only . but it is not fully finished yet .
marketing executive : five minutes for finishing .
project manager : this is about the functional design , the things .
marketing executive : management expert , you have to change that .
project manager : i am when i said it , i remember i had it here .
marketing executive : marketing .
user interface designer : it is a read - only version .
marketing executive : but you can save it u the under another name .
project manager : marketing expert , about the three functions where which are most used and which must immediately be visible on our remote control . , it must be simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people . so , this is really about wh what kind things must be in it and
marketing executive : maybe the
project manager : i understand you , talk a little bit dutch .
marketing executive : the you . no , you have to put , switch channels at the top , because that is the most used function and teletext at the second
project manager : oka , i really did not knew that .
marketing executive : nay , a volume changing , second .
project manager : so , this one is first .
marketing executive : s switch , yes .
project manager : you go there and you go there .
marketing executive : go on .
project manager : maybe then do it one two three .
marketing executive : yes , very good .
user interface designer : one two three .
project manager : if the order is in is important , that is the word for .
marketing executive : the order .
project manager : then the conceptual design . , all the things we have discussed , the energy , which turn out to be batteries , so that is
user interface designer : maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost .
project manager : because . , he here it is still double - curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable .
marketing executive : single - curves .
project manager : the buttons
industrial designer : it is not double .
user interface designer : a single - curved .
industrial designer : it is not double anymore , ?
project manager : not double anymore .
marketing executive : no , .
project manager : nay but that this is what
marketing executive : was initial , the plan . the initial plan .
project manager : and the added functions like tetris snake , it is under the parental control , the touch - screen . so , it is just a summary of what we had discussed
industrial designer : on thing one small thing , the added functions . , was it included in the cost ?
user interface designer : it is very cheap .
project manager : it is very cheap ,
industrial designer : it is very cheap .
project manager : you maybe you come at
marketing executive : no , it is not very cheap , but that
project manager : it is very necessary .
marketing executive : no , but it is a development inside corporation . like , w we do not have to buy parental control . our own people can make that , .
project manager : but it still has some
marketing executive : it has some cost , but
project manager : . , but so we can discuss that
user interface designer : he will do it in his free time . so
project manager : we can discuss that things with the board of
user interface designer : of directur or directors .
project manager : what is it what is the company called ? keep forgetting it .
marketing executive : real reaction .
project manager : real reaction . real reaction , .
user interface designer : you can ask your personal
project manager : so anybody misses something here about
user interface designer : the end conclusion .
project manager : that is what i am gonna write b between now .
marketing executive : . still the end conclusion . that is all , .
project manager : but , i in here nothing
user interface designer : the decision to make the buttons on the top , and the menu on the
project manager :  .
user interface designer : on the bottom . and clearly , touch - screen you have mentioned .
project manager : touch - screen i have mentioned .
marketing executive : but the decisions are put in the conclusion , . why we decided to use a flat l_c_d _ .
user interface designer : this n .
project manager : i gonna redesign something now .
user interface designer : party party .
project manager : because it will , five minutes from to finish meeting .
user interface designer : before you change anything maybe you save it first .
marketing executive : save it .
user interface designer : you ca not you can select file and export and then those j _ peg files .
marketing executive : but then you had the same thing .
user interface designer : eight . and we have , another blank one .
marketing executive : example of children remote .
user interface designer : did we change anything ? it is a new commercial logo .
marketing executive : that is a pity .
user interface designer : do not save it , aye ?
project manager : that is , tim . finish meeting now . , i am

industrial designer : hereby is the meeting is finished .
marketing executive : you declare .
project manager : i am the one who can say that . hereby the meeting is finished .","the project manager opened the meeting and went over the agenda . the user interface designer and the industrial designer presented their prototype design , describing the shape and layout of the remote . the group discussed colour options and decided to make the standard remote in fruity colours , but with the option of buying different exchangeable covers which might appeal more to older buyers . the marketing expert led the prototype evaluation and the group were happy with their product . the group calculated the production costs . the group were 4 euros over budget , so they decided to make the case single-curved and not to use kinetic energy . the project manager led the evaluation of the project process . the group felt that only the industrial designer and the user interface designer were able to be creative and work as a team . it was felt that the first meeting was disorganised because of poor leadership but the leadership improved in the later meetings . the group were also had problems with the digital pens . the group helped the project manager fill in the final report before the close of the meeting . the project manager will finish the final report . the remote will come in fruity colours as standard with the option of buying different exchangeable covers . the case will be single-curved instead of double-curved . the remote will be battery powered and will no longer use kinetic energy . the production costs were 4 euros over budget . which features should be changed to reduce production costs . there were not enough opportunities for creativity and teamwork . the digital pens did not work very well .
","the project manager opened the meeting and then the user interface designer and industrial designer presented their prototype for the remote . the first prototype featured a single touch-screen device , with a locator function . the second prototype was shaped like a banana with children users in mind . the marketing expert gave the group an evaluation of the prototype . the group discussed the production costs of the remote; the total cost came to 12.50 euro , although this did not include the cost of the recharger , which was not on the price list). the group then discussed their experience on the project . they felt they worked well together and were creative , and they discussed using the smartboard as their tool . they also had problems using the meeting-room equipment . they were satisfied with the increased budget but felt constrained by the lack of time . they had problems with their laptops and did not have internet access at the time of the meeting .",x,,,,,x,,,5.0,BART-Cons
69,"project manager : would not wanna be project manager . , what we going to do . , once again i am gonna take minutes . so , no presentation for me . , first we have a prototype presentation by g _ and g _ . afterwards some
user interface designer : yo .
marketing executive : j _ and j _ .
project manager : eval evalu
industrial designer : evaluation .
project manager : evaluation
user interface designer : evaluation criteria .
marketing executive : evaluation .
project manager : s . evaluation crit criteria . , in combination with the finance i received a an excel file which we have to fill in later on . , and then we must see if we stay under the twelve and a half euro .
marketing executive : .
project manager : so , that is a big
industrial designer :  . that is gonna be t problem .
project manager : l so let is it we have must ,
user interface designer : some creative
project manager : we must have some time for that because it will be , quite a lot of mathematics .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and after that , an evaluation of the process how we have done it here with the smartboard , with the with our laptops , with the all this . and afterwards , we closing . once again , forty minutes , so let is start . i would g give the word to g _ and g _ for the prototype presentation .
user interface designer : shall i give a short introduction and then
industrial designer : .
project manager : j _ and j _ .
user interface designer : j _ and j _ , .
marketing executive : jane and jane . guys , take it away .
user interface designer : take it away .
industrial designer : hi .
user interface designer : this was our first concept . we decided to use a single touch - screen . so , we have worked out this concepts , how to hold it , where to put the buttons and . and , we began with a form of shape , that is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed . so , we made i it a little bit less thick and it has some ar artistic meaning . this is not nothing . idea maybe is better . , during the meeting i showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and the menu structure , if necessary , with your other hand , so it is just gonna hold it easily . and it has to be acce accessible with your other hand too , . so we began working out a concept .
industrial designer : and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel l_c_d _ screen . , these would be the main buttons , h you could change them later on in your own profile if you want to . but , it is standard they will be delivered with this set - up . we have the more advanced menu setting right here . we have the sub - menus and stu . we made a top , or a front view . just so like you wanna back view . as you can see , this there , there are two weird bumps in it . this is for the added effect of y youth and dynamic . and this is for the artistic effect . , what we figured is we will show you a picture later on you have more b a better idea after that . but , idea is for to stay in balance with these two . and so when you put it on the table , it will just lay down . it wo not roll around or . but it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , or like these old phones . y you may get the idea . so thi this is about how we figured it should be . the s panel we g you would hide with some more rubber layers , like we discussed early on . , you would s you would not see the straight panel , but more fluidly and round .
user interface designer : the panel just goes like this . but the overlaying layer is a little bit curved and .
project manager : no , .
industrial designer : and , in these bumps you could actually put some electronics that would you can make a more thinner design , and that would actually look very , . and , about the colour , what have
user interface designer : we added that this can be held with your hands for this maximum is om , one and a half centimetres . so , you have room here for your battery and maybe even other electronic chips . s and you can just be the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as thin as possible in the middle for good grip .
industrial designer : f , as colours , do you have the picture in now , this is the idea about the bumps . , you can see there is a v a very youthful dynamic exterior . it you just want to hold it you are young and dynamic like us .
marketing executive : is l it is like an easter egg .
industrial designer : it is like an e but this is for children . we we want a more adult version . but , this is like a remote control for children .
project manager : it is called a weemote
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : weemote .
project manager : weemote .
industrial designer : hey , that is actually a brilliant marketing stand . , but
marketing executive : what i w got in mind .
industrial designer : so this actually basic the idea . we we just want to build a more adult vers adult version of this .
project manager : imagine that .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : and and for colours , we figured starting with basic colours like white or metallic grey . those are the technological colours actually ,
user interface designer : it would be best to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable ,
industrial designer : so it d
user interface designer : so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple ,
industrial designer : or blue or whatever .
user interface designer : but when the o older people go in the shop and they see an orange remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one . and young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , they think , i will buy for a couple of euros some noi hip
marketing executive : maybe it is an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the shop .
user interface designer : a cover is necessary , als otherwise you will just have the l_c_d _ screen .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : so , there must be some cheap standard cover , maybe white ,
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : that is could comes with it and you can buy , so we can make extra money .
project manager : but you d you must not forget that our target aim is younger people .
marketing executive : oui .
project manager : we had decided to put some flashy fruity colours in it , and in the survey from milan and paris it came out that the d the older people are more willing to spend money on extra features . so it will be a better idea to have some flashy fruity colours as a standard ,
user interface designer : the other way around , you mean .
project manager : and for the people who really want a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they are willing to pay that . they want they want more luxury , but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : so , maybe it is an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard .
industrial designer : . , maybe , perhaps you are right . , i would actually agree with this sounds logical .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : an another idea . , maybe we could develop a cover with wood style . they will the elder users as .
user interface designer : a colour of a wood style , a white c and a couple of h hip fruity colours . and lea l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too much .
industrial designer : nah .
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : this is banana and mango , not purple or p orange and yellow .
marketing executive : exactly .
project manager : but , the mai th the standard must be some attractive flashy colours .
marketing executive : . or blue or
project manager : not too , but w a little ,
user interface designer : .
project manager : because that is our aim .
industrial designer : li like this . this is not this is not too much , is it ?
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : i f
project manager : the buttons do not have to be all of
industrial designer : . the buttons ,
marketing executive : so .
industrial designer : i
marketing executive : except for the buttons it is it could be a standard model .
project manager : it
industrial designer : something like this would be . , that is it from us .
marketing executive : it is my time now .
user interface designer : it is my turn .
project manager : the marketing expert .
industrial designer : uh - oh .
marketing executive : during the design life - cycle we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and . , now is the time to evaluate our prototype concept to the past requirements . so we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis . , we are going to do that with a seven point scale . opening a word document now . one , i have to expla explain something . we have to be consensive about things . so , it has to be a group decision .
project manager :
marketing executive : ?
project manager : so we gon we gonna evaluate the
marketing executive : we are going to vote . we
project manager : the thing we saw .
marketing executive : ? the prototype .
project manager : just saw .
marketing executive : one . the remote control is designed for people with age below forty .
project manager : .
marketing executive : seven is false .
project manager : true .
marketing executive : b one or
project manager : one .
industrial designer : why ?
marketing executive : most true ?
industrial designer : it is not just designed for people under the age of forty . it is also designed for people above forty .
marketing executive : so
industrial designer : so
marketing executive : so a o one is appropriate ?
user interface designer : no no , a little more in the middle .
marketing executive : or , more like a four .
user interface designer : no , three or .
industrial designer : i have i have
marketing executive : three .
industrial designer : two or three , because it is not just the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty . but it is also designed for people of age above forty . so ,
marketing executive : exactly .
industrial designer : i will say it is about three .
user interface designer : it will be primary appealing to m minus forty , but also appealing to
marketing executive : but also for , . the remote control is beautiful .
user interface designer : it is
marketing executive : acco according to us , it is one ? or
user interface designer : it is the marketing angle on television . we have a wonderful
marketing executive : p s of c you have to be very positive and enthusiastic about your own product .
user interface designer : it is also fancy then .
marketing executive : the remote control looks fancy .
industrial designer : yes .
marketing executive : one ?
user interface designer : . we have a perfect remote .
marketing executive : good . the remote control has big , clear channel switching buttons .
user interface designer : yes . they have to agree but
project manager : yes .
industrial designer : leads to user face , .
user interface designer : i am the user interface expert .
marketing executive : daniel . , teletext buttons and volume buttons ?
user interface designer : no .
project manager : no teletext buttons . teletext is in the menu .
user interface designer : you you have different menu .
industrial designer : false .
marketing executive : false ?
user interface designer : and volume is impo
marketing executive : and volume ?
project manager : volume is true .
marketing executive : true . big and clear ?
industrial designer : the they are big and clear .
user interface designer : big and clear .
project manager : big and clear .
user interface designer : but you could make a teletext button six .

user interface designer : otherwise , the people who read this are gonna think we have no teletext button .
marketing executive : hide .
industrial designer : but the teletext button . , you can ch that is in a menu .
marketing executive : it is it is not
industrial designer : so , it is w , it
marketing executive : it
industrial designer : it is not entirely unclear ,
marketing executive : j
industrial designer : but so , i would not give it a seven .
user interface designer : no .
industrial designer : i would give it a more a five or a six .
marketing executive : five ?
industrial designer : i don i . what do you think , mister project manager ?
marketing executive : it is .
project manager : . i was thinking very black and white .
user interface designer : black and red .
project manager : j _ .
user interface designer : do not forget to save it .
marketing executive : red . the remote control is easy to be found .
user interface designer : when we put in fancy colours ,
project manager : fruity .
user interface designer : and
industrial designer : it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape . so , if you so if you have trouble finding it
user interface designer : but , it is not making any sound , have we deciding ?
marketing executive :
user interface designer : so
marketing executive : but if you put your normal remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ?
user interface designer : it will make a difference . we have the better re i . my remote control is black .
marketing executive : a li little bit maybe ?
user interface designer : a little bit , but .
project manager : we p we can do it glow in the dark .
marketing executive : four ? fi
project manager : so , if it is in the dark place , you still see it glowing .
user interface designer : k .
marketing executive : i
user interface designer : fo fo five is .
marketing executive : five . it is it is it does not really make a lot of
industrial designer : then i will go for four . because four is between three and also between true and false .
user interface designer : you are right .
marketing executive : yes , but five is between four and six .
industrial designer : so i will go for four .
project manager : you must see it as , w according to the other remote controls , there may be there in your t_v _ room , this one will stand out , .
industrial designer : wha
marketing executive : b _ .
industrial designer : that is a better question actually .
project manager : exa that is what it is about .
marketing executive : it is
user interface designer : if your fifteen remotes in a drawer , you find it , ?
project manager : if it if this lying on your couch , you are you think what is that for kinda orange thing . so
marketing executive : but but the survey under users was that they really lost it .
user interface designer : that is stupid .
marketing executive : like , no not seeing it , but lost it in the house .
user interface designer : but when you lost it you are just not
marketing executive : but , .
industrial designer : if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere , then you would recognise it as , whoa , that is strange .
project manager : that is our remote control .
user interface designer : mostly when you lose your remote control , it is under your
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : what is that . ,
user interface designer : most of times when you lose it you are sitting on it .
industrial designer : so it is
marketing executive : eight , the remote control has fresh , fruity colours .
project manager : true .
user interface designer : i would call choose two , we decided not to make two f fresh colours , as it would not .
marketing executive : not too flashy . the remote control is made of soft material .
industrial designer : rubber , is soft .
project manager : but not too soft we have decided .
user interface designer : kinda soft , but not this .
marketing executive : three ?
project manager : three , .
user interface designer : easy to use ,
project manager : easy to use .
user interface designer : very afford .
marketing executive : easy to use ?
project manager : can it be zero ?
industrial designer : i don , it is
marketing executive : top easy to use ? it is it is not the most easy to use
user interface designer : you can do two , because
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : it can be easier .
user interface designer : it can be easier . but then you are l
industrial designer : it could .
marketing executive : jus just with ten buttons , that is the easiest .
user interface designer : but then you will lose function f , functionality and our fancy look , so .
industrial designer : functional ability .
marketing executive : but the most easy to use is just with one button
user interface designer : but it is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible .
marketing executive : on t , but easy n not the most easy to use , .
industrial designer : no , it is it i will go for two . my vote is on two .
marketing executive : two ?
project manager : two .
user interface designer : m mine too .
marketing executive : we also have to compare it to the remote controls on the market nowadays . so
user interface designer : but waits just a minutes .
project manager : what is the time ? we also have to do the evaluation , the production costs and .
user interface designer : these are the m regular remotes .
marketing executive : i am hurrying . the remote control is innovative .
user interface designer : yes , true , one .
project manager : you are agree , tim ?
marketing executive : a very
project manager : you have not seen a more innovative thing in paris ?
marketing executive : the remote control has m remova removable from multilux .
user interface designer : yes , one . very multifunctional .
marketing executive : the remote control , i it has speech recognition .
project manager : false .
industrial designer : yes ,
marketing executive : false .
industrial designer : it
user interface designer : this is used with speech recognition , this .
marketing executive : the remote control has built - in games ?
user interface designer : but , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub - menu and not it is not an entire game .
project manager : but they are built in , so it is one .
industrial designer : they are built in .
marketing executive : and the last , paren parental advisory function .
industrial designer : you really like the parental advisory .

industrial designer : he made it .
user interface designer : it changes it maybe .
marketing executive : i will
user interface designer : yay .
marketing executive : do the math .
user interface designer : dear .
marketing executive : now it is your turn .
project manager : we will see .
user interface designer : ?
project manager : we have now to c to calculate the production cost . if it is under twelve and half euro , then it is . but i is it if it is b ? no , this is not right .
user interface designer : if they are under twelve fifty .
project manager : if they under . , it is
user interface designer : ?
project manager : if the costs are under twelve and a half euro , then we can ra move on to the project evaluation , as we have experienced it . otherwise , we have do have to do a little redesign thingy . so , we have to fill in the numbers of the component components . we have to fil , want to do it in and see if we stay under the twelve and a half euro . so , do we have a hand dynamo ?
industrial designer : me , too .
user interface designer : battery , yes .
project manager : battery , one ?
user interface designer : one , .
project manager : kinetic , one ?
user interface designer : kinetic , one .
industrial designer : .
project manager : solar cells , zero . , simple chip on print ?
industrial designer : n no .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : no ? no , advanced chip .
marketing executive : advanced chip .
project manager : sample sensor sample speaker ?
user interface designer : no , the advanced chip is
marketing executive : advanced chip is three .
project manager : three ?
marketing executive : three euros , .
project manager : but it is one thing , it is three euro .
industrial designer : we have one . we have one
marketing executive : one piece , .
project manager : what is the sample sensor ?
industrial designer : no , sev zero . , that is
marketing executive : speech recognition , .
user interface designer : you give it a sample , one .
industrial designer : speech recognition and s
project manager : zero . , uncurved flat .
industrial designer : a zero .
project manager : but is it s it is not made from a single uncurved thingy and then
user interface designer : you no .
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : thingy .
project manager : no ? so it is only once double - curved .
marketing executive : yes ,
user interface designer : the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the o on the back of the
marketing executive : three .
project manager : we are now in a problem , we have reached eleven euro yet .
user interface designer : we do not have anything else . so
marketing executive : go on .
project manager : but we have
industrial designer : just go on . then we will see wha how much we are over budget .
user interface designer : could you step a little to the right ma
marketing executive : two .
project manager : rubber .
user interface designer : or
project manager : you .
industrial designer : zero .
project manager : titanium , no ?
user interface designer : and zero . special is the special colour ?
project manager : special colour ?
industrial designer : i do not . no , this is a standard colour .
project manager : but we want to make the wood colours , that
marketing executive : s
industrial designer : yes , this is a special colour .
user interface designer : if you are honest , we will type one , special colour .
marketing executive : but d but daniel , tha that is another brand .
industrial designer : that is an add - on .
marketing executive : that is another article to sell .
project manager : but we going to , that is true . but , it is it
user interface designer : j maybe we will finish the list first and then look back , aye ?
marketing executive : that does not account for this . producing this .
project manager : the push - button , no .
user interface designer : scroll wheel , no .
project manager : scroll - wheel , no . , button , no . no , the
user interface designer : is it
project manager : we do not have a s
user interface designer : no .
industrial designer : these three .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : we are only four euro over budget .
project manager : . so , what is the thing we can change ?
industrial designer : but , other case , we can make it single - curved or uncurved .
project manager : can i say something ?
user interface designer : single - curves .
project manager : no , can i say something as project manager ? the kinetic thing , can we just skip it ,
user interface designer : just cut off the kine
project manager : because you have to shake it , but that is not really innovative .
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : we just put a good battery it . mobile phones nowadays .
marketing executive : daniel . daniel ,
project manager : yo .
marketing executive : what do you think about here .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : what do you think about putting a battery in it , but also selling like the covers , a docking station just apart from the thing , so that you can put
project manager :  .
marketing executive : rechargeable batteries in it and just
user interface designer : but you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual .
project manager : and not really .
marketing executive : .
project manager : but we if you forget about the kinetic ,
marketing executive : just an idea .
user interface designer : that is a cost reduc
project manager : if we do that , we shall .
industrial designer : you can go from double - curved to single - curved . and that would solve the budget problem .
project manager : b but i but the single - curved is just
user interface designer : so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then no , it is just one curve and not a back curved . or
industrial designer : it is just , the single - curve that .
project manager : so that is wh tha that is one option .
user interface designer : or are these two curves ?
project manager : and then w , and then we could have it , but it is its ' it is r it is the main point of the look .
user interface designer : but what else do we have to cut out ? no advanced chip , that is a little bit of problem .
industrial designer : we going to cut
project manager : no , tho that can be done . so ,
user interface designer : although , can we make it with a regular chip ?
project manager : a little less conversation .
user interface designer : curvy .
marketing executive : hey , those ar arcs , why are there for ? the blue
project manager : fill in just a
user interface designer : explanation .
project manager : explanation .
user interface designer : twelve fifty .
project manager : delete it for you if you want .
marketing executive : no , no .
project manager : so , if we do this , we are on twelve and a half euro . and we are done .
user interface designer : but does it fit with our design ?
project manager : the only thing that do not
user interface designer : do we have to u adapt it ? it is single - curves .
project manager : single - curved , but there is a curve in it . so
user interface designer : w could we just make the bubbles cut off the back , and then we are has
industrial designer : we just make it flat . but , you do l
marketing executive : but , wha , look , what is the if you make it double - curved , it costs one euro more .
user interface designer : more . you make it optional .
marketing executive : but no , but does it have a lot of extra
industrial designer : function .
user interface designer : functional .
marketing executive : fun function more like
industrial designer : worth , does it have added worth ?
user interface designer : there is an a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality .
industrial designer : no ,
project manager : it is really a static value .
marketing executive : aesthetic . , you make like eleven and a half euros profit instead of twelve and a half . but i if twelve and a half is a fixed price .
project manager : it is .
industrial designer : let is assume it is .
marketing executive : no , we ca not go above that .
industrial designer : we we should assume it i that it is . but i figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : r if you promote a kinetic i kinetic remote control , that would b sell better than an a normal remote control .
project manager : do you think ? , now you can shake your remote control .
marketing executive : so .
industrial designer : no , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k remote control is kinetic .
project manager : kinetic .
industrial designer : you have standard old battery control remote con
marketing executive : what a what about all the m the environment freaks ?
user interface designer : but it does not fit in our co cost profile . so
marketing executive : not freaks , the envi
industrial designer : true .
marketing executive : it look like this one .
user interface designer : you ma can make an especialised extra gold version .
project manager : who because if you want to go to kinetic , you are on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , and now it is more of a compromise thing . and if you make the single curve ha just a big curve , then it is
user interface designer : just one big curve .
project manager : one big good curve . i was going to say nasty words , but i do not . this is strange . wood is m is cheaper than rubber . we thought that wood would be more expensive .
user interface designer : this american figures . you just cut down some trees .
project manager : maybe . but that this is it ?
marketing executive : this is it .
user interface designer : whoever makes a remote control out of titanium .
project manager : i am gonna save it .
industrial designer : it is possible , but you ca not use double curves for titanium . that is one of the functionability
project manager : considering we have
marketing executive : no , we have to do all those hours again . costs on no redesign .
project manager : we were above , so we did a little redesign
user interface designer : we sue . we , we will start her all o all over again .
project manager : now it is about time to talk about this project . , some things . were there room for was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ?
marketing executive : i did not . that there was a lot of room for it . but , that is mainly because of the information that was delivered to us . it was just fixed information and get your from there , and i could not go on i on the internet and search my own . bu
project manager : that is true . i agree with that .
industrial designer : i th you two , especially you and daniel , you d you both had the less creative roles in the project .
project manager : .
user interface designer : for us , there was a lot of creativity .
industrial designer : m
user interface designer : we could just sign up an remote if we liked .
industrial designer : jeroen and i , we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than you two .
marketing executive : . , that is true .
project manager : how about the leadership ?
industrial designer : ha .
marketing executive : leadership was crappy .
user interface designer : crappy . cra
industrial designer : nah , the leadership was not crappy , it was the leader that was crappy .
project manager : very much .
industrial designer : nah . no , the leadership was .
project manager : now we are done .
user interface designer : example of crappy leadershi
marketing executive : no , leadership was
industrial designer : it was good .
marketing executive : the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . , you could have but , it was your first , no disrespect , but you could have structure it a l little bit more . so like , i was talking most of the time the first meeting , and
user interface designer : you could of said , shut up you fool .
project manager : . i notice it too . i was a i was also very unhappy , very unsatisfied about the
marketing executive : about me .
project manager : about the first meeting . so , i hope the other meetings
industrial designer : try to learn from your mistake . and we will never do it again .
marketing executive : you made up .
project manager : get better and the last two meetings also we reached some good decisions about talk
marketing executive : no , it you did better .
user interface designer : more consensus . ev everybody w was agreeing every
marketing executive : much more constructive .
project manager : so that is . , maybe that is only , it is for us , because
user interface designer : we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task .
project manager : and it is wo more like presentation and some points were discussed .
user interface designer : so , it is a little bit
project manager : but , really teamwork were you two
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : two guys .
project manager : the
industrial designer : that went w it went . it is it is just
user interface designer : stupid stupid pen , but
project manager : no hard feelings .
industrial designer : nah . , we had some trouble with the pen , but
project manager : now you must push a little while .
user interface designer : but draw something difficult .
industrial designer : but us
user interface designer : d just write your name right now . try to write your name , in writing letters , ? , normally , this the w block letter sign it , ?
project manager : o just
user interface designer : just just write your name in one line . if it is a little bit too small bit quicker now .
project manager : you can be you can go quicker , then it wo not notice it .
user interface designer : it did not he knows how it works , .
project manager : i follow the master class for the smartboard , so that is the main issue . , so about this one you were you are dealing with ,
marketing executive : means .
project manager : the digital pen .
user interface designer : y , . th the i the idea is great , but it does not work properly .
project manager : .
marketing executive : digital pen , th the first time i did individual work , i used it . but , a and the first two meetings i brought it with me , but i did not use it after the first meeting .
industrial designer : no , i have it working . but ,
marketing executive : it is it is not real use for me .
industrial designer : no , it does not have that much added value to the
user interface designer : nee . as as i said a m a c few moments ago , it i would like , myself , to write with a normal pen , because must , it is almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . i it is the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s very slow .
project manager : m . and it is still your own handwriting popping up in word .
user interface designer : yes . no , and it does not give any added value .
project manager : no , that is true .
marketing executive : not really , no .
project manager : and the smartboard is useful , but the pen is i not user - friendly , .
user interface designer : not user - friendly .
project manager : be it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things ,
user interface designer : and it is not very precise .
project manager : and that is the
user interface designer : we are trying to m to
marketing executive : like when you do this .
user interface designer : it may , and tr try to wri write your name in a normal size , .
marketing executive : smaller ?
user interface designer : smaller . just like when you are writing on a letter .
project manager : but that is not th the you when you at a foreign audience , you b do not gonna wr write small .
user interface designer : a as you saw on this drawing , just open this one or that one . it is th it , we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons , it is almost impossible to get clear when you are
project manager : but maybe there is some function with no , it is not . with
user interface designer : and the eraser was another problem . it w t is this large . and when you try to erase this line , y
project manager : i am gonna erase my name .
user interface designer : i am gonna erase my name there .
project manager : it is a big eraser .
marketing executive : new ideas ?
user interface designer : m abo what new ideas ?
project manager : the idea of the touch - screen is
marketing executive : do you ?
project manager : i am just
user interface designer : new ideas about the working of this software , about the project , about the remote controls or
marketing executive : .
project manager : i what .
user interface designer : hello .
marketing executive : did you heard what he said ? i do not i what . , i have some figure . the eva the evaluation , the mean number is one point eight six .
project manager : that is interesting .
marketing executive : so that is fairly good , .
project manager : because what does it mean ?
user interface designer : so true .
marketing executive : that
project manager : all the mo , are between one and two .
marketing executive : all the requirements are true or very true , right .
project manager : . but the new ideas found for wi with working with this software ?
user interface designer : not really , just they have to improve it .
project manager : not really , ?
user interface designer : the concept is , but it has to be quicker . , it is still opening my programme , n almo almost my entire computer is locked up during the process and it , just takes too many time . people will still feel the need to write it quickly on a page and not download it and save it , and
project manager : you had expected it to be more
user interface designer : more user - friendly . when you use a pen , you can just draw like you d draw normally , and you do
marketing executive : may maybe the idea you proposed is a screen here . and draw it , and it is placed over there .
user interface designer : that l would be easier . or at least when you do not have to adapt to the technology , just you can write in the way you normally write . and now you have to keep constantly in mind that you are drawing on this screen .
marketing executive : ?
user interface designer : and that is a very bad concept .
marketing executive : very bad .
user interface designer : nah , i it is my opinion that i
marketing executive : this is better than regular flip - overs ,
user interface designer : it is can be saved easier . but if you are in normal flip - over you a lot of people write text . there is no text option . and writing text , you have got ta really do your best to write some
project manager : and maybe some functions for circle or a square . you have to draw it yourself now .
user interface designer : or maybe even insert picture . if you have some presentation , and you have some f
industrial designer : or text function . just t type text , and that would be excellent . mean
marketing executive : but insert image is not available ?
user interface designer : then you could
marketing executive : here . picture from scanner , clip - art .
project manager : that can be done already . but not the predefined squares
user interface designer : so you can
marketing executive : hyperlink ? hey , what if you do like hyperlink ?
user interface designer : with w_w _ dot google dot com .
marketing executive : type type it ?
user interface designer : maybe .
marketing executive : re real reaction dot n_l _ . yes , is now is .
user interface designer : you will just make a link in
project manager : that is .
user interface designer : there is one way to
project manager : is it
marketing executive : double - click it .
user interface designer : maybe if you are not using the eraser
project manager : here .
marketing executive : you are erasing .
user interface designer : something else th , arrow .
project manager : .
marketing executive : double - click it .
project manager : so you have
user interface designer : it is
project manager : as you saw , you have a little , you can you can go there . so there the functionality is there , but it is not ideal , and it is very it costs a lot of time to
user interface designer : to use , .
project manager : to use . and that is a pity , if you have thirty , forty minutes for this things , and we are now with four people ,
user interface designer : and that is m
project manager : but it , imagine you are here you are with the ten people and everyone
user interface designer : that is mostly the case , from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case , and if you have to do all this kind
project manager : two minutes of drawing , .
user interface designer : you will rather use powerpoint and work it out in advance . and th the one or two things you have to draw when you are there , just use a flip - board .
marketing executive : what i really miss also is a d is a turtle is a decision system like with the evaluation , you have to polls like , what do you want , a one , a two , maybe a l a little application like give your own number and click one two three four five six seven .
project manager : just like he said with the a screen which you can write , also a voting mechanism .
marketing executive : j ju , v voting application . just a little group decision application .
industrial designer : but , problem is , you ca not discuss anything you ca you can , but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now . we w one person s maybe said three . but , i we said , no i w th think two , because this and this , and then you can react on it . but if you put a three on it , just figure , everybody knows what i am knowing , so they will all just put a two on .
marketing executive : . but , you can still discuss about it ,
industrial designer : but it would .
marketing executive : but click it in an application , that is a lot easier to process .
industrial designer : the for processing part .
marketing executive : the digit .
industrial designer : but then , the idea of one person entering it and the rest discussing it , that is not that bad idea , actually . not that your opinion is not valued , but still .
project manager : so
user interface designer : yo , manager .
marketing executive : that is it ?
project manager : just about ,
user interface designer : when are w
project manager : because
user interface designer : when are we going to produce it ?
project manager : tomorrow ? , the costs are within the budget .
marketing executive : celebration .
project manager : the project is evaluated . but , before we going to celebrate , i have a little question which you ca not answer , because there must be some end report . i am busy with the end report right now . you might thinking what the hell was he doing
marketing executive : what is an end report ?
project manager : about all the meetings , what we have decided , a r a report of this day . , that must be made , but i , here is standing whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is
marketing executive : you ha you have ten minutes left , i read . you have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report .
project manager : that can be done . maybe we can do it together . you can see what i have so i s i will put it on a story - board . you can see it . because it will it must be
marketing executive : you you already made a beta version , or
project manager : it is a three with seventy five
marketing executive : pages .
project manager : just about .
industrial designer : y yikes . seventy five pages .
project manager : just a moment .
marketing executive : daniel . do you want a chair maybe ?
user interface designer : a chairman .
project manager : no no ,
marketing executive : hey ?
project manager : you can s you can read it and here it is .
industrial designer : so you finished it actually , and so we just have to read it and say yes or no ?
project manager : this not nit it read - only . but it is not fully finished yet .
marketing executive : five minutes for finishing .
project manager : this is about the functional design , the things .
marketing executive : management expert , you have to change that .
project manager : i am when i said it , i remember i had it here .
marketing executive : marketing .
user interface designer : it is a read - only version .
marketing executive : but you can save it u the under another name .
project manager : marketing expert , about the three functions where which are most used and which must immediately be visible on our remote control . , it must be simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people . so , this is really about wh what kind things must be in it and
marketing executive : maybe the
project manager : i understand you , talk a little bit dutch .
marketing executive : the you . no , you have to put , switch channels at the top , because that is the most used function and teletext at the second
project manager : oka , i really did not knew that .
marketing executive : nay , a volume changing , second .
project manager : so , this one is first .
marketing executive : s switch , yes .
project manager : you go there and you go there .
marketing executive : go on .
project manager : maybe then do it one two three .
marketing executive : yes , very good .
user interface designer : one two three .
project manager : if the order is in is important , that is the word for .
marketing executive : the order .
project manager : then the conceptual design . , all the things we have discussed , the energy , which turn out to be batteries , so that is
user interface designer : maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost .
project manager : because . , he here it is still double - curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable .
marketing executive : single - curves .
project manager : the buttons
industrial designer : it is not double .
user interface designer : a single - curved .
industrial designer : it is not double anymore , ?
project manager : not double anymore .
marketing executive : no , .
project manager : nay but that this is what
marketing executive : was initial , the plan . the initial plan .
project manager : and the added functions like tetris snake , it is under the parental control , the touch - screen . so , it is just a summary of what we had discussed
industrial designer : on thing one small thing , the added functions . , was it included in the cost ?
user interface designer : it is very cheap .
project manager : it is very cheap ,
industrial designer : it is very cheap .
project manager : you maybe you come at
marketing executive : no , it is not very cheap , but that
project manager : it is very necessary .
marketing executive : no , but it is a development inside corporation . like , w we do not have to buy parental control . our own people can make that , .
project manager : but it still has some
marketing executive : it has some cost , but
project manager : . , but so we can discuss that
user interface designer : he will do it in his free time . so
project manager : we can discuss that things with the board of
user interface designer : of directur or directors .
project manager : what is it what is the company called ? keep forgetting it .
marketing executive : real reaction .
project manager : real reaction . real reaction , .
user interface designer : you can ask your personal
project manager : so anybody misses something here about
user interface designer : the end conclusion .
project manager : that is what i am gonna write b between now .
marketing executive : . still the end conclusion . that is all , .
project manager : but , i in here nothing
user interface designer : the decision to make the buttons on the top , and the menu on the
project manager :  .
user interface designer : on the bottom . and clearly , touch - screen you have mentioned .
project manager : touch - screen i have mentioned .
marketing executive : but the decisions are put in the conclusion , . why we decided to use a flat l_c_d _ .
user interface designer : this n .
project manager : i gonna redesign something now .
user interface designer : party party .
project manager : because it will , five minutes from to finish meeting .
user interface designer : before you change anything maybe you save it first .
marketing executive : save it .
user interface designer : you ca not you can select file and export and then those j _ peg files .
marketing executive : but then you had the same thing .
user interface designer : eight . and we have , another blank one .
marketing executive : example of children remote .
user interface designer : did we change anything ? it is a new commercial logo .
marketing executive : that is a pity .
user interface designer : do not save it , aye ?
project manager : that is , tim . finish meeting now . , i am
user interface designer : why are only the first five smartboard files
project manager : i am going to finish my end report .
user interface designer : saved ?
industrial designer : hereby is the meeting is finished .
marketing executive : you declare .
project manager : i am the one who can say that . hereby the meeting is finished .","the project manager opened the meeting and went over the agenda . the user interface designer and the industrial designer presented their prototype design , describing the shape and layout of the remote . the group discussed colour options and decided to make the standard remote in fruity colours , but with the option of buying different exchangeable covers which might appeal more to older buyers . the marketing expert led the prototype evaluation and the group were happy with their product . the group calculated the production costs . the group were 4 euros over budget , so they decided to make the case single-curved and not to use kinetic energy . the project manager led the evaluation of the project process . the group felt that only the industrial designer and the user interface designer were able to be creative and work as a team . it was felt that the first meeting was disorganised because of poor leadership but the leadership improved in the later meetings . the group were also had problems with the digital pens . the group helped the project manager fill in the final report before the close of the meeting . the project manager will finish the final report . the remote will come in fruity colours as standard with the option of buying different exchangeable covers . the case will be single-curved instead of double-curved . the remote will be battery powered and will no longer use kinetic energy . the production costs were 4 euros over budget . which features should be changed to reduce production costs . there were not enough opportunities for creativity and teamwork . the digital pens did not work very well .
","the project manager introduced the upcoming project to the group and then the user interface designer and industrial designer presented a prototype of the remote which featured a single touch screen . the group discussed their initial ideas about the design and the shape of the device . they discussed making the remote easier to hold in one hand , artistic in appearance , and easy to use with the other hand . after the prototype presentation the group conducted an evaluation of the project process , finding that the project cost exceeded the budget by 12 and a half euros . it was decided to use a curved case and that the remote would not feature a smartboard . there was also a discussion about whether the remote should have a touch screen or lcd screen and whether it would be spongy or not curved or flat . na .",x,,x,x,,,,,6.0,T5-Baseline
70,"project manager : would not wanna be project manager . , what we going to do . , once again i am gonna take minutes . so , no presentation for me . , first we have a prototype presentation by g _ and g _ . afterwards some
user interface designer : yo .
marketing executive : j _ and j _ .
project manager : eval evalu
industrial designer : evaluation .
project manager : evaluation
user interface designer : evaluation criteria .
marketing executive : evaluation .
project manager : s . evaluation crit criteria . , in combination with the finance i received a an excel file which we have to fill in later on . , and then we must see if we stay under the twelve and a half euro .
marketing executive : .
project manager : so , that is a big
industrial designer :  . that is gonna be t problem .
project manager : l so let is it we have must ,
user interface designer : some creative
project manager : we must have some time for that because it will be , quite a lot of mathematics .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and after that , an evaluation of the process how we have done it here with the smartboard , with the with our laptops , with the all this . and afterwards , we closing . once again , forty minutes , so let is start . i would g give the word to g _ and g _ for the prototype presentation .
user interface designer : shall i give a short introduction and then
industrial designer : .
project manager : j _ and j _ .
user interface designer : j _ and j _ , .
marketing executive : jane and jane . guys , take it away .
user interface designer : take it away .
industrial designer : hi .
user interface designer : this was our first concept . we decided to use a single touch - screen . so , we have worked out this concepts , how to hold it , where to put the buttons and . and , we began with a form of shape , that is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed . so , we made i it a little bit less thick and it has some ar artistic meaning . this is not nothing . idea maybe is better . , during the meeting i showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and the menu structure , if necessary , with your other hand , so it is just gonna hold it easily . and it has to be acce accessible with your other hand too , . so we began working out a concept .
industrial designer : and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel l_c_d _ screen . , these would be the main buttons , h you could change them later on in your own profile if you want to . but , it is standard they will be delivered with this set - up . we have the more advanced menu setting right here . we have the sub - menus and stu . we made a top , or a front view . just so like you wanna back view . as you can see , this there , there are two weird bumps in it . this is for the added effect of y youth and dynamic . and this is for the artistic effect . , what we figured is we will show you a picture later on you have more b a better idea after that . but , idea is for to stay in balance with these two . and so when you put it on the table , it will just lay down . it wo not roll around or . but it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , or like these old phones . y you may get the idea . so thi this is about how we figured it should be . the s panel we g you would hide with some more rubber layers , like we discussed early on . , you would s you would not see the straight panel , but more fluidly and round .
user interface designer : the panel just goes like this . but the overlaying layer is a little bit curved and .
project manager : no , .
industrial designer : and , in these bumps you could actually put some electronics that would you can make a more thinner design , and that would actually look very , . and , about the colour , what have
user interface designer : we added that this can be held with your hands for this maximum is om , one and a half centimetres . so , you have room here for your battery and maybe even other electronic chips . s and you can just be the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as thin as possible in the middle for good grip .
industrial designer : f , as colours , do you have the picture in now , this is the idea about the bumps . , you can see there is a v a very youthful dynamic exterior . it you just want to hold it you are young and dynamic like us .
marketing executive : is l it is like an easter egg .
industrial designer : it is like an e but this is for children . we we want a more adult version . but , this is like a remote control for children .
project manager : it is called a weemote
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : weemote .
project manager : weemote .
industrial designer : hey , that is actually a brilliant marketing stand . , but
marketing executive : what i w got in mind .
industrial designer : so this actually basic the idea . we we just want to build a more adult vers adult version of this .
project manager : imagine that .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : and and for colours , we figured starting with basic colours like white or metallic grey . those are the technological colours actually ,
user interface designer : it would be best to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable ,
industrial designer : so it d
user interface designer : so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple ,
industrial designer : or blue or whatever .
user interface designer : but when the o older people go in the shop and they see an orange remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one . and young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , they think , i will buy for a couple of euros some noi hip
marketing executive : maybe it is an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the shop .
user interface designer : a cover is necessary , als otherwise you will just have the l_c_d _ screen .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : so , there must be some cheap standard cover , maybe white ,
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : that is could comes with it and you can buy , so we can make extra money .
project manager : but you d you must not forget that our target aim is younger people .
marketing executive : oui .
project manager : we had decided to put some flashy fruity colours in it , and in the survey from milan and paris it came out that the d the older people are more willing to spend money on extra features . so it will be a better idea to have some flashy fruity colours as a standard ,
user interface designer : the other way around , you mean .
project manager : and for the people who really want a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they are willing to pay that . they want they want more luxury , but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : so , maybe it is an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard .
industrial designer : . , maybe , perhaps you are right . , i would actually agree with this sounds logical .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : an another idea . , maybe we could develop a cover with wood style . they will the elder users as .
user interface designer : a colour of a wood style , a white c and a couple of h hip fruity colours . and lea l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too much .
industrial designer : nah .
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : this is banana and mango , not purple or p orange and yellow .
marketing executive : exactly .
project manager : but , the mai th the standard must be some attractive flashy colours .
marketing executive : . or blue or
project manager : not too , but w a little ,
user interface designer : .
project manager : because that is our aim .
industrial designer : li like this . this is not this is not too much , is it ?
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : i f
project manager : the buttons do not have to be all of
industrial designer : . the buttons ,
marketing executive : so .
industrial designer : i
marketing executive : except for the buttons it is it could be a standard model .
project manager : it
industrial designer : something like this would be . , that is it from us .
marketing executive : it is my time now .
user interface designer : it is my turn .
project manager : the marketing expert .
industrial designer : uh - oh .
marketing executive : during the design life - cycle we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and . , now is the time to evaluate our prototype concept to the past requirements . so we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis . , we are going to do that with a seven point scale . opening a word document now . one , i have to expla explain something . we have to be consensive about things . so , it has to be a group decision .
project manager :
marketing executive : ?
project manager : so we gon we gonna evaluate the
marketing executive : we are going to vote . we
project manager : the thing we saw .
marketing executive : ? the prototype .
project manager : just saw .
marketing executive : one . the remote control is designed for people with age below forty .
project manager : .
marketing executive : seven is false .
project manager : true .
marketing executive : b one or
project manager : one .
industrial designer : why ?
marketing executive : most true ?
industrial designer : it is not just designed for people under the age of forty . it is also designed for people above forty .
marketing executive : so
industrial designer : so
marketing executive : so a o one is appropriate ?
user interface designer : no no , a little more in the middle .
marketing executive : or , more like a four .
user interface designer : no , three or .
industrial designer : i have i have
marketing executive : three .
industrial designer : two or three , because it is not just the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty . but it is also designed for people of age above forty . so ,
marketing executive : exactly .
industrial designer : i will say it is about three .
user interface designer : it will be primary appealing to m minus forty , but also appealing to
marketing executive : but also for , . the remote control is beautiful .
user interface designer : it is
marketing executive : acco according to us , it is one ? or
user interface designer : it is the marketing angle on television . we have a wonderful
marketing executive : p s of c you have to be very positive and enthusiastic about your own product .
user interface designer : it is also fancy then .
marketing executive : the remote control looks fancy .
industrial designer : yes .
marketing executive : one ?
user interface designer : . we have a perfect remote .
marketing executive : good . the remote control has big , clear channel switching buttons .
user interface designer : yes . they have to agree but
project manager : yes .
industrial designer : leads to user face , .
user interface designer : i am the user interface expert .
marketing executive : daniel . , teletext buttons and volume buttons ?
user interface designer : no .
project manager : no teletext buttons . teletext is in the menu .
user interface designer : you you have different menu .
industrial designer : false .
marketing executive : false ?
user interface designer : and volume is impo
marketing executive : and volume ?
project manager : volume is true .
marketing executive : true . big and clear ?
industrial designer : the they are big and clear .
user interface designer : big and clear .
project manager : big and clear .
user interface designer : but you could make a teletext button six .
marketing executive : hey .
user interface designer : otherwise , the people who read this are gonna think we have no teletext button .
marketing executive : hide .
industrial designer : but the teletext button . , you can ch that is in a menu .
marketing executive : it is it is not
industrial designer : so , it is w , it
marketing executive : it
industrial designer : it is not entirely unclear ,
marketing executive : j
industrial designer : but so , i would not give it a seven .
user interface designer : no .
industrial designer : i would give it a more a five or a six .
marketing executive : five ?
industrial designer : i don i . what do you think , mister project manager ?
marketing executive : it is .
project manager : . i was thinking very black and white .
user interface designer : black and red .
project manager : j _ .
user interface designer : do not forget to save it .
marketing executive : red . the remote control is easy to be found .
user interface designer : when we put in fancy colours ,
project manager : fruity .
user interface designer : and
industrial designer : it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape . so , if you so if you have trouble finding it
user interface designer : but , it is not making any sound , have we deciding ?
marketing executive :
user interface designer : so
marketing executive : but if you put your normal remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ?
user interface designer : it will make a difference . we have the better re i . my remote control is black .
marketing executive : a li little bit maybe ?
user interface designer : a little bit , but .
project manager : we p we can do it glow in the dark .
marketing executive : four ? fi
project manager : so , if it is in the dark place , you still see it glowing .
user interface designer : k .
marketing executive : i
user interface designer : fo fo five is .
marketing executive : five . it is it is it does not really make a lot of
industrial designer : then i will go for four . because four is between three and also between true and false .
user interface designer : you are right .
marketing executive : yes , but five is between four and six .
industrial designer : so i will go for four .
project manager : you must see it as , w according to the other remote controls , there may be there in your t_v _ room , this one will stand out , .
industrial designer : wha
marketing executive : b _ .
industrial designer : that is a better question actually .
project manager : exa that is what it is about .
marketing executive : it is
user interface designer : if your fifteen remotes in a drawer , you find it , ?
project manager : if it if this lying on your couch , you are you think what is that for kinda orange thing . so
marketing executive : but but the survey under users was that they really lost it .
user interface designer : that is stupid .
marketing executive : like , no not seeing it , but lost it in the house .
user interface designer : but when you lost it you are just not
marketing executive : but , .
industrial designer : if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere , then you would recognise it as , whoa , that is strange .
project manager : that is our remote control .
user interface designer : mostly when you lose your remote control , it is under your
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : what is that . ,
user interface designer : most of times when you lose it you are sitting on it .
industrial designer : so it is
marketing executive : eight , the remote control has fresh , fruity colours .
project manager : true .
user interface designer : i would call choose two , we decided not to make two f fresh colours , as it would not .
marketing executive : not too flashy . the remote control is made of soft material .
industrial designer : rubber , is soft .
project manager : but not too soft we have decided .
user interface designer : kinda soft , but not this .
marketing executive : three ?
project manager : three , .
user interface designer : easy to use ,
project manager : easy to use .
user interface designer : very afford .
marketing executive : easy to use ?
project manager : can it be zero ?
industrial designer : i don , it is
marketing executive : top easy to use ? it is it is not the most easy to use
user interface designer : you can do two , because
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : it can be easier .
user interface designer : it can be easier . but then you are l
industrial designer : it could .
marketing executive : jus just with ten buttons , that is the easiest .
user interface designer : but then you will lose function f , functionality and our fancy look , so .
industrial designer : functional ability .
marketing executive : but the most easy to use is just with one button
user interface designer : but it is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible .
marketing executive : on t , but easy n not the most easy to use , .
industrial designer : no , it is it i will go for two . my vote is on two .
marketing executive : two ?
project manager : two .
user interface designer : m mine too .
marketing executive : we also have to compare it to the remote controls on the market nowadays . so
user interface designer : but waits just a minutes .
project manager : what is the time ? we also have to do the evaluation , the production costs and .
user interface designer : these are the m regular remotes .
marketing executive : i am hurrying . the remote control is innovative .
user interface designer : yes , true , one .
project manager : you are agree , tim ?
marketing executive : a very

project manager : false .
industrial designer : yes ,
marketing executive : false .
industrial designer : it
user interface designer : this is used with speech recognition , this .
marketing executive : the remote control has built - in games ?
user interface designer : but , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub - menu and not it is not an entire game .
project manager : but they are built in , so it is one .
industrial designer : they are built in .

user interface designer : yay .
marketing executive : do the math .
user interface designer : dear .
marketing executive : now it is your turn .
project manager : we will see .
user interface designer : ?
project manager : we have now to c to calculate the production cost . if it is under twelve and half euro , then it is . but i is it if it is b ? no , this is not right .
user interface designer : if they are under twelve fifty .
project manager : if they under . , it is
user interface designer : ?
project manager : if the costs are under twelve and a half euro , then we can ra move on to the project evaluation , as we have experienced it . otherwise , we have do have to do a little redesign thingy . so , we have to fill in the numbers of the component components . we have to fil , want to do it in and see if we stay under the twelve and a half euro . so , do we have a hand dynamo ?
industrial designer : me , too .
user interface designer : battery , yes .
project manager : battery , one ?
user interface designer : one , .
project manager : kinetic , one ?
user interface designer : kinetic , one .
industrial designer : .
project manager : solar cells , zero . , simple chip on print ?
industrial designer : n no .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : no ? no , advanced chip .
marketing executive : advanced chip .
project manager : sample sensor sample speaker ?
user interface designer : no , the advanced chip is
marketing executive : advanced chip is three .
project manager : three ?
marketing executive : three euros , .
project manager : but it is one thing , it is three euro .
industrial designer : we have one . we have one
marketing executive : one piece , .
project manager : what is the sample sensor ?
industrial designer : no , sev zero . , that is
marketing executive : speech recognition , .
user interface designer : you give it a sample , one .
industrial designer : speech recognition and s
project manager : zero . , uncurved flat .
industrial designer : a zero .
project manager : but is it s it is not made from a single uncurved thingy and then
user interface designer : you no .
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : thingy .
project manager : no ? so it is only once double - curved .
marketing executive : yes ,
user interface designer : the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the o on the back of the
marketing executive : three .
project manager : we are now in a problem , we have reached eleven euro yet .
user interface designer : we do not have anything else . so
marketing executive : go on .
project manager : but we have
industrial designer : just go on . then we will see wha how much we are over budget .
user interface designer : could you step a little to the right ma
marketing executive : two .
project manager : rubber .
user interface designer : or
project manager : you .
industrial designer : zero .
project manager : titanium , no ?
user interface designer : and zero . special is the special colour ?
project manager : special colour ?
industrial designer : i do not . no , this is a standard colour .
project manager : but we want to make the wood colours , that
marketing executive : s
industrial designer : yes , this is a special colour .
user interface designer : if you are honest , we will type one , special colour .
marketing executive : but d but daniel , tha that is another brand .
industrial designer : that is an add - on .
marketing executive : that is another article to sell .
project manager : but we going to , that is true . but , it is it
user interface designer : j maybe we will finish the list first and then look back , aye ?
marketing executive : that does not account for this . producing this .
project manager : the push - button , no .
user interface designer : scroll wheel , no .
project manager : scroll - wheel , no . , button , no . no , the
user interface designer : is it
project manager : we do not have a s
user interface designer : no .
industrial designer : these three .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : we are only four euro over budget .
project manager : . so , what is the thing we can change ?
industrial designer : but , other case , we can make it single - curved or uncurved .
project manager : can i say something ?
user interface designer : single - curves .
project manager : no , can i say something as project manager ? the kinetic thing , can we just skip it ,
user interface designer : just cut off the kine
project manager : because you have to shake it , but that is not really innovative .
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : we just put a good battery it . mobile phones nowadays .
marketing executive : daniel . daniel ,
project manager : yo .
marketing executive : what do you think about here .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : what do you think about putting a battery in it , but also selling like the covers , a docking station just apart from the thing , so that you can put
project manager :  .
marketing executive : rechargeable batteries in it and just
user interface designer : but you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual .
project manager : and not really .
marketing executive : .
project manager : but we if you forget about the kinetic ,
marketing executive : just an idea .
user interface designer : that is a cost reduc
project manager : if we do that , we shall .
industrial designer : you can go from double - curved to single - curved . and that would solve the budget problem .
project manager : b but i but the single - curved is just
user interface designer : so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then no , it is just one curve and not a back curved . or
industrial designer : it is just , the single - curve that .
project manager : so that is wh tha that is one option .
user interface designer : or are these two curves ?
project manager : and then w , and then we could have it , but it is its ' it is r it is the main point of the look .
user interface designer : but what else do we have to cut out ? no advanced chip , that is a little bit of problem .
industrial designer : we going to cut
project manager : no , tho that can be done . so ,
user interface designer : although , can we make it with a regular chip ?
project manager : a little less conversation .
user interface designer : curvy .
marketing executive : hey , those ar arcs , why are there for ? the blue
project manager : fill in just a
user interface designer : explanation .
project manager : explanation .
user interface designer : twelve fifty .
project manager : delete it for you if you want .
marketing executive : no , no .
project manager : so , if we do this , we are on twelve and a half euro . and we are done .
user interface designer : but does it fit with our design ?
project manager : the only thing that do not
user interface designer : do we have to u adapt it ? it is single - curves .
project manager : single - curved , but there is a curve in it . so
user interface designer : w could we just make the bubbles cut off the back , and then we are has
industrial designer : we just make it flat . but , you do l
marketing executive : but , wha , look , what is the if you make it double - curved , it costs one euro more .
user interface designer : more . you make it optional .
marketing executive : but no , but does it have a lot of extra
industrial designer : function .
user interface designer : functional .
marketing executive : fun function more like
industrial designer : worth , does it have added worth ?
user interface designer : there is an a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality .
industrial designer : no ,
project manager : it is really a static value .
marketing executive : aesthetic . , you make like eleven and a half euros profit instead of twelve and a half . but i if twelve and a half is a fixed price .
project manager : it is .
industrial designer : let is assume it is .
marketing executive : no , we ca not go above that .
industrial designer : we we should assume it i that it is . but i figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : r if you promote a kinetic i kinetic remote control , that would b sell better than an a normal remote control .
project manager : do you think ? , now you can shake your remote control .
marketing executive : so .
industrial designer : no , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k remote control is kinetic .
project manager : kinetic .
industrial designer : you have standard old battery control remote con
marketing executive : what a what about all the m the environment freaks ?
user interface designer : but it does not fit in our co cost profile . so
marketing executive : not freaks , the envi
industrial designer : true .
marketing executive : it look like this one .
user interface designer : you ma can make an especialised extra gold version .
project manager : who because if you want to go to kinetic , you are on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , and now it is more of a compromise thing . and if you make the single curve ha just a big curve , then it is
user interface designer : just one big curve .
project manager : one big good curve . i was going to say nasty words , but i do not . this is strange . wood is m is cheaper than rubber . we thought that wood would be more expensive .
user interface designer : this american figures . you just cut down some trees .
project manager : maybe . but that this is it ?
marketing executive : this is it .
user interface designer : whoever makes a remote control out of titanium .
project manager : i am gonna save it .
industrial designer : it is possible , but you ca not use double curves for titanium . that is one of the functionability
project manager : considering we have
marketing executive : no , we have to do all those hours again . costs on no redesign .
project manager : we were above , so we did a little redesign
user interface designer : we sue . we , we will start her all o all over again .
project manager : now it is about time to talk about this project . , some things . were there room for was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ?
marketing executive : i did not . that there was a lot of room for it . but , that is mainly because of the information that was delivered to us . it was just fixed information and get your from there , and i could not go on i on the internet and search my own . bu
project manager : that is true . i agree with that .
industrial designer : i th you two , especially you and daniel , you d you both had the less creative roles in the project .
project manager : .
user interface designer : for us , there was a lot of creativity .
industrial designer : m
user interface designer : we could just sign up an remote if we liked .
industrial designer : jeroen and i , we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than you two .
marketing executive : . , that is true .
project manager : how about the leadership ?
industrial designer : ha .
marketing executive : leadership was crappy .
user interface designer : crappy . cra
industrial designer : nah , the leadership was not crappy , it was the leader that was crappy .
project manager : very much .
industrial designer : nah . no , the leadership was .
project manager : now we are done .
user interface designer : example of crappy leadershi
marketing executive : no , leadership was
industrial designer : it was good .
marketing executive : the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . , you could have but , it was your first , no disrespect , but you could have structure it a l little bit more . so like , i was talking most of the time the first meeting , and
user interface designer : you could of said , shut up you fool .
project manager : . i notice it too . i was a i was also very unhappy , very unsatisfied about the
marketing executive : about me .
project manager : about the first meeting . so , i hope the other meetings
industrial designer : try to learn from your mistake . and we will never do it again .
marketing executive : you made up .
project manager : get better and the last two meetings also we reached some good decisions about talk
marketing executive : no , it you did better .
user interface designer : more consensus . ev everybody w was agreeing every
marketing executive : much more constructive .
project manager : so that is . , maybe that is only , it is for us , because
user interface designer : we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task .
project manager : and it is wo more like presentation and some points were discussed .
user interface designer : so , it is a little bit
project manager : but , really teamwork were you two
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : two guys .
project manager : the
industrial designer : that went w it went . it is it is just
user interface designer : stupid stupid pen , but
project manager : no hard feelings .
industrial designer : nah . , we had some trouble with the pen , but
project manager : now you must push a little while .
user interface designer : but draw something difficult .
industrial designer : but us
user interface designer : d just write your name right now . try to write your name , in writing letters , ? , normally , this the w block letter sign it , ?
project manager : o just
user interface designer : just just write your name in one line . if it is a little bit too small bit quicker now .
project manager : you can be you can go quicker , then it wo not notice it .
user interface designer : it did not he knows how it works , .
project manager : i follow the master class for the smartboard , so that is the main issue . , so about this one you were you are dealing with ,
marketing executive : means .
project manager : the digital pen .
user interface designer : y , . th the i the idea is great , but it does not work properly .
project manager : .
marketing executive : digital pen , th the first time i did individual work , i used it . but , a and the first two meetings i brought it with me , but i did not use it after the first meeting .
industrial designer : no , i have it working . but ,
marketing executive : it is it is not real use for me .
industrial designer : no , it does not have that much added value to the
user interface designer : nee . as as i said a m a c few moments ago , it i would like , myself , to write with a normal pen , because must , it is almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . i it is the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s very slow .
project manager : m . and it is still your own handwriting popping up in word .
user interface designer : yes . no , and it does not give any added value .
project manager : no , that is true .
marketing executive : not really , no .
project manager : and the smartboard is useful , but the pen is i not user - friendly , .
user interface designer : not user - friendly .
project manager : be it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things ,
user interface designer : and it is not very precise .
project manager : and that is the
user interface designer : we are trying to m to
marketing executive : like when you do this .
user interface designer : it may , and tr try to wri write your name in a normal size , .
marketing executive : smaller ?
user interface designer : smaller . just like when you are writing on a letter .
project manager : but that is not th the you when you at a foreign audience , you b do not gonna wr write small .
user interface designer : a as you saw on this drawing , just open this one or that one . it is th it , we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons , it is almost impossible to get clear when you are
project manager : but maybe there is some function with no , it is not . with
user interface designer : and the eraser was another problem . it w t is this large . and when you try to erase this line , y
project manager : i am gonna erase my name .
user interface designer : i am gonna erase my name there .
project manager : it is a big eraser .
marketing executive : new ideas ?
user interface designer : m abo what new ideas ?
project manager : the idea of the touch - screen is
marketing executive : do you ?
project manager : i am just
user interface designer : new ideas about the working of this software , about the project , about the remote controls or
marketing executive : .
project manager : i what .
user interface designer : hello .
marketing executive : did you heard what he said ? i do not i what . , i have some figure . the eva the evaluation , the mean number is one point eight six .
project manager : that is interesting .
marketing executive : so that is fairly good , .
project manager : because what does it mean ?
user interface designer : so true .
marketing executive : that
project manager : all the mo , are between one and two .
marketing executive : all the requirements are true or very true , right .
project manager : . but the new ideas found for wi with working with this software ?
user interface designer : not really , just they have to improve it .
project manager : not really , ?
user interface designer : the concept is , but it has to be quicker . , it is still opening my programme , n almo almost my entire computer is locked up during the process and it , just takes too many time . people will still feel the need to write it quickly on a page and not download it and save it , and
project manager : you had expected it to be more
user interface designer : more user - friendly . when you use a pen , you can just draw like you d draw normally , and you do
marketing executive : may maybe the idea you proposed is a screen here . and draw it , and it is placed over there .
user interface designer : that l would be easier . or at least when you do not have to adapt to the technology , just you can write in the way you normally write . and now you have to keep constantly in mind that you are drawing on this screen .
marketing executive : ?
user interface designer : and that is a very bad concept .
marketing executive : very bad .
user interface designer : nah , i it is my opinion that i
marketing executive : this is better than regular flip - overs ,
user interface designer : it is can be saved easier . but if you are in normal flip - over you a lot of people write text . there is no text option . and writing text , you have got ta really do your best to write some
project manager : and maybe some functions for circle or a square . you have to draw it yourself now .
user interface designer : or maybe even insert picture . if you have some presentation , and you have some f
industrial designer : or text function . just t type text , and that would be excellent . mean
marketing executive : but insert image is not available ?
user interface designer : then you could
marketing executive : here . picture from scanner , clip - art .
project manager : that can be done already . but not the predefined squares
user interface designer : so you can
marketing executive : hyperlink ? hey , what if you do like hyperlink ?
user interface designer : with w_w _ dot google dot com .
marketing executive : type type it ?
user interface designer : maybe .
marketing executive : re real reaction dot n_l _ . yes , is now is .
user interface designer : you will just make a link in
project manager : that is .
user interface designer : there is one way to
project manager : is it
marketing executive : double - click it .
user interface designer : maybe if you are not using the eraser
project manager : here .
marketing executive : you are erasing .
user interface designer : something else th , arrow .
project manager : .
marketing executive : double - click it .
project manager : so you have
user interface designer : it is
project manager : as you saw , you have a little , you can you can go there . so there the functionality is there , but it is not ideal , and it is very it costs a lot of time to
user interface designer : to use , .
project manager : to use . and that is a pity , if you have thirty , forty minutes for this things , and we are now with four people ,
user interface designer : and that is m
project manager : but it , imagine you are here you are with the ten people and everyone
user interface designer : that is mostly the case , from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case , and if you have to do all this kind
project manager : two minutes of drawing , .
user interface designer : you will rather use powerpoint and work it out in advance . and th the one or two things you have to draw when you are there , just use a flip - board .
marketing executive : what i really miss also is a d is a turtle is a decision system like with the evaluation , you have to polls like , what do you want , a one , a two , maybe a l a little application like give your own number and click one two three four five six seven .
project manager : just like he said with the a screen which you can write , also a voting mechanism .
marketing executive : j ju , v voting application . just a little group decision application .
industrial designer : but , problem is , you ca not discuss anything you ca you can , but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now . we w one person s maybe said three . but , i we said , no i w th think two , because this and this , and then you can react on it . but if you put a three on it , just figure , everybody knows what i am knowing , so they will all just put a two on .
marketing executive : . but , you can still discuss about it ,
industrial designer : but it would .
marketing executive : but click it in an application , that is a lot easier to process .
industrial designer : the for processing part .
marketing executive : the digit .
industrial designer : but then , the idea of one person entering it and the rest discussing it , that is not that bad idea , actually . not that your opinion is not valued , but still .
project manager : so
user interface designer : yo , manager .
marketing executive : that is it ?
project manager : just about ,
user interface designer : when are w
project manager : because
user interface designer : when are we going to produce it ?
project manager : tomorrow ? , the costs are within the budget .
marketing executive : celebration .
project manager : the project is evaluated . but , before we going to celebrate , i have a little question which you ca not answer , because there must be some end report . i am busy with the end report right now . you might thinking what the hell was he doing
marketing executive : what is an end report ?
project manager : about all the meetings , what we have decided , a r a report of this day . , that must be made , but i , here is standing whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is
marketing executive : you ha you have ten minutes left , i read . you have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report .
project manager : that can be done . maybe we can do it together . you can see what i have so i s i will put it on a story - board . you can see it . because it will it must be
marketing executive : you you already made a beta version , or
project manager : it is a three with seventy five
marketing executive : pages .
project manager : just about .
industrial designer : y yikes . seventy five pages .
project manager : just a moment .
marketing executive : daniel . do you want a chair maybe ?
user interface designer : a chairman .
project manager : no no ,
marketing executive : hey ?
project manager : you can s you can read it and here it is .
industrial designer : so you finished it actually , and so we just have to read it and say yes or no ?
project manager : this not nit it read - only . but it is not fully finished yet .
marketing executive : five minutes for finishing .
project manager : this is about the functional design , the things .
marketing executive : management expert , you have to change that .
project manager : i am when i said it , i remember i had it here .
marketing executive : marketing .
user interface designer : it is a read - only version .
marketing executive : but you can save it u the under another name .
project manager : marketing expert , about the three functions where which are most used and which must immediately be visible on our remote control . , it must be simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people . so , this is really about wh what kind things must be in it and
marketing executive : maybe the
project manager : i understand you , talk a little bit dutch .
marketing executive : the you . no , you have to put , switch channels at the top , because that is the most used function and teletext at the second
project manager : oka , i really did not knew that .
marketing executive : nay , a volume changing , second .
project manager : so , this one is first .
marketing executive : s switch , yes .
project manager : you go there and you go there .
marketing executive : go on .
project manager : maybe then do it one two three .
marketing executive : yes , very good .
user interface designer : one two three .
project manager : if the order is in is important , that is the word for .
marketing executive : the order .
project manager : then the conceptual design . , all the things we have discussed , the energy , which turn out to be batteries , so that is
user interface designer : maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost .
project manager : because . , he here it is still double - curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable .
marketing executive : single - curves .
project manager : the buttons
industrial designer : it is not double .
user interface designer : a single - curved .
industrial designer : it is not double anymore , ?
project manager : not double anymore .
marketing executive : no , .
project manager : nay but that this is what
marketing executive : was initial , the plan . the initial plan .
project manager : and the added functions like tetris snake , it is under the parental control , the touch - screen . so , it is just a summary of what we had discussed
industrial designer : on thing one small thing , the added functions . , was it included in the cost ?
user interface designer : it is very cheap .
project manager : it is very cheap ,
industrial designer : it is very cheap .
project manager : you maybe you come at
marketing executive : no , it is not very cheap , but that
project manager : it is very necessary .
marketing executive : no , but it is a development inside corporation . like , w we do not have to buy parental control . our own people can make that , .
project manager : but it still has some
marketing executive : it has some cost , but
project manager : . , but so we can discuss that
user interface designer : he will do it in his free time . so
project manager : we can discuss that things with the board of
user interface designer : of directur or directors .
project manager : what is it what is the company called ? keep forgetting it .
marketing executive : real reaction .
project manager : real reaction . real reaction , .
user interface designer : you can ask your personal
project manager : so anybody misses something here about
user interface designer : the end conclusion .
project manager : that is what i am gonna write b between now .
marketing executive : . still the end conclusion . that is all , .
project manager : but , i in here nothing
user interface designer : the decision to make the buttons on the top , and the menu on the
project manager :  .
user interface designer : on the bottom . and clearly , touch - screen you have mentioned .
project manager : touch - screen i have mentioned .
marketing executive : but the decisions are put in the conclusion , . why we decided to use a flat l_c_d _ .
user interface designer : this n .
project manager : i gonna redesign something now .
user interface designer : party party .
project manager : because it will , five minutes from to finish meeting .
user interface designer : before you change anything maybe you save it first .
marketing executive : save it .
user interface designer : you ca not you can select file and export and then those j _ peg files .
marketing executive : but then you had the same thing .
user interface designer : eight . and we have , another blank one .
marketing executive : example of children remote .
user interface designer : did we change anything ? it is a new commercial logo .
marketing executive : that is a pity .
user interface designer : do not save it , aye ?
project manager : that is , tim . finish meeting now . , i am
user interface designer : why are only the first five smartboard files
project manager : i am going to finish my end report .
user interface designer : saved ?
industrial designer : hereby is the meeting is finished .
marketing executive : you declare .
project manager : i am the one who can say that . hereby the meeting is finished .","the project manager opened the meeting and went over the agenda . the user interface designer and the industrial designer presented their prototype design , describing the shape and layout of the remote . the group discussed colour options and decided to make the standard remote in fruity colours , but with the option of buying different exchangeable covers which might appeal more to older buyers . the marketing expert led the prototype evaluation and the group were happy with their product . the group calculated the production costs . the group were 4 euros over budget , so they decided to make the case single-curved and not to use kinetic energy . the project manager led the evaluation of the project process . the group felt that only the industrial designer and the user interface designer were able to be creative and work as a team . it was felt that the first meeting was disorganised because of poor leadership but the leadership improved in the later meetings . the group were also had problems with the digital pens . the group helped the project manager fill in the final report before the close of the meeting . the project manager will finish the final report . the remote will come in fruity colours as standard with the option of buying different exchangeable covers . the case will be single-curved instead of double-curved . the remote will be battery powered and will no longer use kinetic energy . the production costs were 4 euros over budget . which features should be changed to reduce production costs . there were not enough opportunities for creativity and teamwork . the digital pens did not work very well .
","the and speech recognition . the designers presented three prototypes to the group and discussed the options for components and the materials used in making the device . the project manager led an evaluation of the prototype . the group discussed the materials and the project process . the industrial designer was instructed to work on the project , and the group decided to use a single-cell battery . the user interface designer was given the option to make the remote more ergonomic and to include a scroll device in addition to the standard buttons . the marketing expert was asked to check the evaluations of the product . the prototype was evaluated on the basis of its look and feel , technological innovation , ease of use , sponginess , and its ability to be misplaced . overall , the prototype performed very well in meeting all the criteria of the evaluation . the remote will be sold for 12.50 euro . the production costs cannot exceed 11.20 euro . one way to prevent the spread of the project's ideas among the group members is to eliminate the extra components that would have to be incorporated into the design in order to stay within the budget .",x,,,x,,x,,,4.0,BART-Baseline

project manager : we must have some time for that because it will be , quite a lot of mathematics .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and after that , an evaluation of the process how we have done it here with the smartboard , with the with our laptops , with the all this . and afterwards , we closing . once again , forty minutes , so let is start . i would g give the word to g _ and g _ for the prototype presentation .
user interface designer : shall i give a short introduction and then
industrial designer : .
project manager : j _ and j _ .
user interface designer : j _ and j _ , .
marketing executive : jane and jane . guys , take it away .
user interface designer : take it away .
industrial designer : hi .
user interface designer : this was our first concept . we decided to use a single touch - screen . so , we have worked out this concepts , how to hold it , where to put the buttons and . and , we began with a form of shape , that is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed . so , we made i it a little bit less thick and it has some ar artistic meaning . this is not nothing . idea maybe is better . , during the meeting i showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and the menu structure , if necessary , with your other hand , so it is just gonna hold it easily . and it has to be acce accessible with your other hand too , . so we began working out a concept .
industrial designer : and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel l_c_d _ screen . , these would be the main buttons , h you could change them later on in your own profile if you want to . but , it is standard they will be delivered with this set - up . we have the more advanced menu setting right here . we have the sub - menus and stu . we made a top , or a front view . just so like you wanna back view . as you can see , this there , there are two weird bumps in it . this is for the added effect of y youth and dynamic . and this is for the artistic effect . , what we figured is we will show you a picture later on you have more b a better idea after that . but , idea is for to stay in balance with these two . and so when you put it on the table , it will just lay down . it wo not roll around or . but it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , or like these old phones . y you may get the idea . so thi this is about how we figured it should be . the s panel we g you would hide with some more rubber layers , like we discussed early on . , you would s you would not see the straight panel , but more fluidly and round .
user interface designer : the panel just goes like this . but the overlaying layer is a little bit curved and .
project manager : no , .
industrial designer : and , in these bumps you could actually put some electronics that would you can make a more thinner design , and that would actually look very , . and , about the colour , what have
user interface designer : we added that this can be held with your hands for this maximum is om , one and a half centimetres . so , you have room here for your battery and maybe even other electronic chips . s and you can just be the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as thin as possible in the middle for good grip .
industrial designer : f , as colours , do you have the picture in now , this is the idea about the bumps . , you can see there is a v a very youthful dynamic exterior . it you just want to hold it you are young and dynamic like us .
marketing executive : is l it is like an easter egg .
industrial designer : it is like an e but this is for children . we we want a more adult version . but , this is like a remote control for children .
project manager : it is called a weemote
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : weemote .
project manager : weemote .
industrial designer : hey , that is actually a brilliant marketing stand . , but
marketing executive : what i w got in mind .
industrial designer : so this actually basic the idea . we we just want to build a more adult vers adult version of this .
project manager : imagine that .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : and and for colours , we figured starting with basic colours like white or metallic grey . those are the technological colours actually ,
user interface designer : it would be best to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable ,
industrial designer : so it d
user interface designer : so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple ,
industrial designer : or blue or whatever .
user interface designer : but when the o older people go in the shop and they see an orange remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one . and young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , they think , i will buy for a couple of euros some noi hip
marketing executive : maybe it is an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the shop .
user interface designer : a cover is necessary , als otherwise you will just have the l_c_d _ screen .
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : so , there must be some cheap standard cover , maybe white ,
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : that is could comes with it and you can buy , so we can make extra money .
project manager : but you d you must not forget that our target aim is younger people .
marketing executive : oui .
project manager : we had decided to put some flashy fruity colours in it , and in the survey from milan and paris it came out that the d the older people are more willing to spend money on extra features . so it will be a better idea to have some flashy fruity colours as a standard ,
user interface designer : the other way around , you mean .
project manager : and for the people who really want a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they are willing to pay that . they want they want more luxury , but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : so , maybe it is an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard .
industrial designer : . , maybe , perhaps you are right . , i would actually agree with this sounds logical .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : an another idea . , maybe we could develop a cover with wood style . they will the elder users as .
user interface designer : a colour of a wood style , a white c and a couple of h hip fruity colours . and lea l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too much .
industrial designer : nah .
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : this is banana and mango , not purple or p orange and yellow .
marketing executive : exactly .
project manager : but , the mai th the standard must be some attractive flashy colours .
marketing executive : . or blue or
project manager : not too , but w a little ,
user interface designer : .
project manager : because that is our aim .
industrial designer : li like this . this is not this is not too much , is it ?
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : i f
project manager : the buttons do not have to be all of
industrial designer : . the buttons ,
marketing executive : so .
industrial designer : i
marketing executive : except for the buttons it is it could be a standard model .
project manager : it
industrial designer : something like this would be . , that is it from us .
marketing executive : it is my time now .
user interface designer : it is my turn .
project manager : the marketing expert .
industrial designer : uh - oh .
marketing executive : during the design life - cycle we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and . , now is the time to evaluate our prototype concept to the past requirements . so we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis . , we are going to do that with a seven point scale . opening a word document now . one , i have to expla explain something . we have to be consensive about things . so , it has to be a group decision .
project manager :
marketing executive : ?
project manager : so we gon we gonna evaluate the
marketing executive : we are going to vote . we
project manager : the thing we saw .
marketing executive : ? the prototype .
project manager : just saw .
marketing executive : one . the remote control is designed for people with age below forty .
project manager : .
marketing executive : seven is false .
project manager : true .
marketing executive : b one or
project manager : one .
industrial designer : why ?
marketing executive : most true ?
industrial designer : it is not just designed for people under the age of forty . it is also designed for people above forty .
marketing executive : so
industrial designer : so
marketing executive : so a o one is appropriate ?
user interface designer : no no , a little more in the middle .
marketing executive : or , more like a four .
user interface designer : no , three or .
industrial designer : i have i have
marketing executive : three .
industrial designer : two or three , because it is not just the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty . but it is also designed for people of age above forty . so ,
marketing executive : exactly .
industrial designer : i will say it is about three .
user interface designer : it will be primary appealing to m minus forty , but also appealing to
marketing executive : but also for , . the remote control is beautiful .
user interface designer : it is
marketing executive : acco according to us , it is one ? or
user interface designer : it is the marketing angle on television . we have a wonderful
marketing executive : p s of c you have to be very positive and enthusiastic about your own product .
user interface designer : it is also fancy then .
marketing executive : the remote control looks fancy .
industrial designer : yes .
marketing executive : one ?
user interface designer : . we have a perfect remote .
marketing executive : good . the remote control has big , clear channel switching buttons .
user interface designer : yes . they have to agree but
project manager : yes .
industrial designer : leads to user face , .
user interface designer : i am the user interface expert .
marketing executive : daniel . , teletext buttons and volume buttons ?
user interface designer : no .
project manager : no teletext buttons . teletext is in the menu .
user interface designer : you you have different menu .
industrial designer : false .
marketing executive : false ?
user interface designer : and volume is impo
marketing executive : and volume ?
project manager : volume is true .
marketing executive : true . big and clear ?
industrial designer : the they are big and clear .
user interface designer : big and clear .
project manager : big and clear .
user interface designer : but you could make a teletext button six .
marketing executive : hey .
user interface designer : otherwise , the people who read this are gonna think we have no teletext button .
marketing executive : hide .
industrial designer : but the teletext button . , you can ch that is in a menu .
marketing executive : it is it is not
industrial designer : so , it is w , it
marketing executive : it
industrial designer : it is not entirely unclear ,
marketing executive : j
industrial designer : but so , i would not give it a seven .
user interface designer : no .
industrial designer : i would give it a more a five or a six .
marketing executive : five ?
industrial designer : i don i . what do you think , mister project manager ?
marketing executive : it is .
project manager : . i was thinking very black and white .
user interface designer : black and red .
project manager : j _ .
user interface designer : do not forget to save it .
marketing executive : red . the remote control is easy to be found .
user interface designer : when we put in fancy colours ,
project manager : fruity .
user interface designer : and
industrial designer : it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape . so , if you so if you have trouble finding it
user interface designer : but , it is not making any sound , have we deciding ?
marketing executive :
user interface designer : so
marketing executive : but if you put your normal remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ?
user interface designer : it will make a difference . we have the better re i . my remote control is black .
marketing executive : a li little bit maybe ?
user interface designer : a little bit , but .
project manager : we p we can do it glow in the dark .
marketing executive : four ? fi
project manager : so , if it is in the dark place , you still see it glowing .
user interface designer : k .
marketing executive : i
user interface designer : fo fo five is .
marketing executive : five . it is it is it does not really make a lot of
industrial designer : then i will go for four . because four is between three and also between true and false .
user interface designer : you are right .
marketing executive : yes , but five is between four and six .
industrial designer : so i will go for four .
project manager : you must see it as , w according to the other remote controls , there may be there in your t_v _ room , this one will stand out , .
industrial designer : wha
marketing executive : b _ .
industrial designer : that is a better question actually .
project manager : exa that is what it is about .
marketing executive : it is
user interface designer : if your fifteen remotes in a drawer , you find it , ?
project manager : if it if this lying on your couch , you are you think what is that for kinda orange thing . so
marketing executive : but but the survey under users was that they really lost it .
user interface designer : that is stupid .
marketing executive : like , no not seeing it , but lost it in the house .
user interface designer : but when you lost it you are just not
marketing executive : but , .
industrial designer : if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere , then you would recognise it as , whoa , that is strange .
project manager : that is our remote control .
user interface designer : mostly when you lose your remote control , it is under your
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : what is that . ,
user interface designer : most of times when you lose it you are sitting on it .
industrial designer : so it is
marketing executive : eight , the remote control has fresh , fruity colours .
project manager : true .
user interface designer : i would call choose two , we decided not to make two f fresh colours , as it would not .
marketing executive : not too flashy . the remote control is made of soft material .
industrial designer : rubber , is soft .
project manager : but not too soft we have decided .
user interface designer : kinda soft , but not this .
marketing executive : three ?
project manager : three , .
user interface designer : easy to use ,
project manager : easy to use .
user interface designer : very afford .
marketing executive : easy to use ?
project manager : can it be zero ?
industrial designer : i don , it is
marketing executive : top easy to use ? it is it is not the most easy to use
user interface designer : you can do two , because
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : it can be easier .
user interface designer : it can be easier . but then you are l
industrial designer : it could .
marketing executive : jus just with ten buttons , that is the easiest .
user interface designer : but then you will lose function f , functionality and our fancy look , so .
industrial designer : functional ability .
marketing executive : but the most easy to use is just with one button
user interface designer : but it is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible .
marketing executive : on t , but easy n not the most easy to use , .
industrial designer : no , it is it i will go for two . my vote is on two .
marketing executive : two ?
project manager : two .
user interface designer : m mine too .
marketing executive : we also have to compare it to the remote controls on the market nowadays . so
user interface designer : but waits just a minutes .
project manager : what is the time ? we also have to do the evaluation , the production costs and .
user interface designer : these are the m regular remotes .
marketing executive : i am hurrying . the remote control is innovative .
user interface designer : yes , true , one .
project manager : you are agree , tim ?
marketing executive : a very
project manager : you have not seen a more innovative thing in paris ?
marketing executive : the remote control has m remova removable from multilux .
user interface designer : yes , one . very multifunctional .
marketing executive : the remote control , i it has speech recognition .
project manager : false .
industrial designer : yes ,
marketing executive : false .
industrial designer : it
user interface designer : this is used with speech recognition , this .
marketing executive : the remote control has built - in games ?
user interface designer : but , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub - menu and not it is not an entire game .
project manager : but they are built in , so it is one .
industrial designer : they are built in .
marketing executive : and the last , paren parental advisory function .
industrial designer : you really like the parental advisory .
project manager : freak .
marketing executive : yes , i do .
user interface designer : th did you make this or the
industrial designer : bu
marketing executive : save as .
industrial designer : he made it .
user interface designer : it changes it maybe .
marketing executive : i will
user interface designer : yay .
marketing executive : do the math .
user interface designer : dear .
marketing executive : now it is your turn .
project manager : we will see .
user interface designer : ?
project manager : we have now to c to calculate the production cost . if it is under twelve and half euro , then it is . but i is it if it is b ? no , this is not right .
user interface designer : if they are under twelve fifty .
project manager : if they under . , it is
user interface designer : ?
project manager : if the costs are under twelve and a half euro , then we can ra move on to the project evaluation , as we have experienced it . otherwise , we have do have to do a little redesign thingy . so , we have to fill in the numbers of the component components . we have to fil , want to do it in and see if we stay under the twelve and a half euro . so , do we have a hand dynamo ?
industrial designer : me , too .
user interface designer : battery , yes .
project manager : battery , one ?
user interface designer : one , .
project manager : kinetic , one ?
user interface designer : kinetic , one .
industrial designer : .
project manager : solar cells , zero . , simple chip on print ?
industrial designer : n no .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : no ? no , advanced chip .
marketing executive : advanced chip .
project manager : sample sensor sample speaker ?
user interface designer : no , the advanced chip is
marketing executive : advanced chip is three .
project manager : three ?
marketing executive : three euros , .
project manager : but it is one thing , it is three euro .
industrial designer : we have one . we have one
marketing executive : one piece , .
project manager : what is the sample sensor ?
industrial designer : no , sev zero . , that is
marketing executive : speech recognition , .
user interface designer : you give it a sample , one .
industrial designer : speech recognition and s
project manager : zero . , uncurved flat .
industrial designer : a zero .
project manager : but is it s it is not made from a single uncurved thingy and then
user interface designer : you no .
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : thingy .
project manager : no ? so it is only once double - curved .
marketing executive : yes ,
user interface designer : the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the o on the back of the
marketing executive : three .
project manager : we are now in a problem , we have reached eleven euro yet .
user interface designer : we do not have anything else . so
marketing executive : go on .
project manager : but we have
industrial designer : just go on . then we will see wha how much we are over budget .
user interface designer : could you step a little to the right ma
marketing executive : two .
project manager : rubber .
user interface designer : or
project manager : you .
industrial designer : zero .
project manager : titanium , no ?
user interface designer : and zero . special is the special colour ?
project manager : special colour ?
industrial designer : i do not . no , this is a standard colour .
project manager : but we want to make the wood colours , that
marketing executive : s
industrial designer : yes , this is a special colour .
user interface designer : if you are honest , we will type one , special colour .
marketing executive : but d but daniel , tha that is another brand .
industrial designer : that is an add - on .
marketing executive : that is another article to sell .
project manager : but we going to , that is true . but , it is it
user interface designer : j maybe we will finish the list first and then look back , aye ?
marketing executive : that does not account for this . producing this .
project manager : the push - button , no .
user interface designer : scroll wheel , no .
project manager : scroll - wheel , no . , button , no . no , the
user interface designer : is it
project manager : we do not have a s
user interface designer : no .
industrial designer : these three .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : we are only four euro over budget .
project manager : . so , what is the thing we can change ?
industrial designer : but , other case , we can make it single - curved or uncurved .
project manager : can i say something ?
user interface designer : single - curves .
project manager : no , can i say something as project manager ? the kinetic thing , can we just skip it ,
user interface designer : just cut off the kine
project manager : because you have to shake it , but that is not really innovative .
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : we just put a good battery it . mobile phones nowadays .
marketing executive : daniel . daniel ,
project manager : yo .
marketing executive : what do you think about here .
project manager : yes .
marketing executive : what do you think about putting a battery in it , but also selling like the covers , a docking station just apart from the thing , so that you can put
project manager :  .
marketing executive : rechargeable batteries in it and just
user interface designer : but you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual .
project manager : and not really .
marketing executive : .
project manager : but we if you forget about the kinetic ,
marketing executive : just an idea .
user interface designer : that is a cost reduc
project manager : if we do that , we shall .
industrial designer : you can go from double - curved to single - curved . and that would solve the budget problem .
project manager : b but i but the single - curved is just
user interface designer : so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then no , it is just one curve and not a back curved . or
industrial designer : it is just , the single - curve that .
project manager : so that is wh tha that is one option .
user interface designer : or are these two curves ?
project manager : and then w , and then we could have it , but it is its ' it is r it is the main point of the look .
user interface designer : but what else do we have to cut out ? no advanced chip , that is a little bit of problem .
industrial designer : we going to cut
project manager : no , tho that can be done . so ,
user interface designer : although , can we make it with a regular chip ?
project manager : a little less conversation .
user interface designer : curvy .
marketing executive : hey , those ar arcs , why are there for ? the blue
project manager : fill in just a
user interface designer : explanation .
project manager : explanation .
user interface designer : twelve fifty .
project manager : delete it for you if you want .
marketing executive : no , no .
project manager : so , if we do this , we are on twelve and a half euro . and we are done .
user interface designer : but does it fit with our design ?
project manager : the only thing that do not
user interface designer : do we have to u adapt it ? it is single - curves .
project manager : single - curved , but there is a curve in it . so
user interface designer : w could we just make the bubbles cut off the back , and then we are has
industrial designer : we just make it flat . but , you do l
marketing executive : but , wha , look , what is the if you make it double - curved , it costs one euro more .
user interface designer : more . you make it optional .
marketing executive : but no , but does it have a lot of extra
industrial designer : function .
user interface designer : functional .
marketing executive : fun function more like
industrial designer : worth , does it have added worth ?
user interface designer : there is an a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality .
industrial designer : no ,
project manager : it is really a static value .
marketing executive : aesthetic . , you make like eleven and a half euros profit instead of twelve and a half . but i if twelve and a half is a fixed price .
project manager : it is .
industrial designer : let is assume it is .
marketing executive : no , we ca not go above that .
industrial designer : we we should assume it i that it is . but i figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : r if you promote a kinetic i kinetic remote control , that would b sell better than an a normal remote control .
project manager : do you think ? , now you can shake your remote control .
marketing executive : so .
industrial designer : no , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k remote control is kinetic .
project manager : kinetic .
industrial designer : you have standard old battery control remote con
marketing executive : what a what about all the m the environment freaks ?
user interface designer : but it does not fit in our co cost profile . so
marketing executive : not freaks , the envi
industrial designer : true .
marketing executive : it look like this one .
user interface designer : you ma can make an especialised extra gold version .
project manager : who because if you want to go to kinetic , you are on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , and now it is more of a compromise thing . and if you make the single curve ha just a big curve , then it is
user interface designer : just one big curve .
project manager : one big good curve . i was going to say nasty words , but i do not . this is strange . wood is m is cheaper than rubber . we thought that wood would be more expensive .
user interface designer : this american figures . you just cut down some trees .
project manager : maybe . but that this is it ?
marketing executive : this is it .
user interface designer : whoever makes a remote control out of titanium .
project manager : i am gonna save it .
industrial designer : it is possible , but you ca not use double curves for titanium . that is one of the functionability
project manager : considering we have
marketing executive : no , we have to do all those hours again . costs on no redesign .
project manager : we were above , so we did a little redesign
user interface designer : we sue . we , we will start her all o all over again .
project manager : now it is about time to talk about this project . , some things . were there room for was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ?
marketing executive : i did not . that there was a lot of room for it . but , that is mainly because of the information that was delivered to us . it was just fixed information and get your from there , and i could not go on i on the internet and search my own . bu
project manager : that is true . i agree with that .
industrial designer : i th you two , especially you and daniel , you d you both had the less creative roles in the project .
project manager : .
user interface designer : for us , there was a lot of creativity .
industrial designer : m
user interface designer : we could just sign up an remote if we liked .
industrial designer : jeroen and i , we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than you two .
marketing executive : . , that is true .
project manager : how about the leadership ?
industrial designer : ha .
marketing executive : leadership was crappy .
user interface designer : crappy . cra
industrial designer : nah , the leadership was not crappy , it was the leader that was crappy .
project manager : very much .
industrial designer : nah . no , the leadership was .
project manager : now we are done .
user interface designer : example of crappy leadershi
marketing executive : no , leadership was
industrial designer : it was good .
marketing executive : the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . , you could have but , it was your first , no disrespect , but you could have structure it a l little bit more . so like , i was talking most of the time the first meeting , and
user interface designer : you could of said , shut up you fool .
project manager : . i notice it too . i was a i was also very unhappy , very unsatisfied about the
marketing executive : about me .
project manager : about the first meeting . so , i hope the other meetings
industrial designer : try to learn from your mistake . and we will never do it again .
marketing executive : you made up .
project manager : get better and the last two meetings also we reached some good decisions about talk
marketing executive : no , it you did better .
user interface designer : more consensus . ev everybody w was agreeing every
marketing executive : much more constructive .
project manager : so that is . , maybe that is only , it is for us , because
user interface designer : we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task .
project manager : and it is wo more like presentation and some points were discussed .
user interface designer : so , it is a little bit
project manager : but , really teamwork were you two
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : two guys .
project manager : the
industrial designer : that went w it went . it is it is just
user interface designer : stupid stupid pen , but
project manager : no hard feelings .
industrial designer : nah . , we had some trouble with the pen , but
project manager : now you must push a little while .
user interface designer : but draw something difficult .
industrial designer : but us
user interface designer : d just write your name right now . try to write your name , in writing letters , ? , normally , this the w block letter sign it , ?
project manager : o just
user interface designer : just just write your name in one line . if it is a little bit too small bit quicker now .
project manager : you can be you can go quicker , then it wo not notice it .
user interface designer : it did not he knows how it works , .
project manager : i follow the master class for the smartboard , so that is the main issue . , so about this one you were you are dealing with ,
marketing executive : means .
project manager : the digital pen .
user interface designer : y , . th the i the idea is great , but it does not work properly .
project manager : .
marketing executive : digital pen , th the first time i did individual work , i used it . but , a and the first two meetings i brought it with me , but i did not use it after the first meeting .
industrial designer : no , i have it working . but ,
marketing executive : it is it is not real use for me .
industrial designer : no , it does not have that much added value to the
user interface designer : nee . as as i said a m a c few moments ago , it i would like , myself , to write with a normal pen , because must , it is almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . i it is the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s very slow .
project manager : m . and it is still your own handwriting popping up in word .
user interface designer : yes . no , and it does not give any added value .
project manager : no , that is true .
marketing executive : not really , no .
project manager : and the smartboard is useful , but the pen is i not user - friendly , .
user interface designer : not user - friendly .
project manager : be it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things ,
user interface designer : and it is not very precise .
project manager : and that is the
user interface designer : we are trying to m to
marketing executive : like when you do this .
user interface designer : it may , and tr try to wri write your name in a normal size , .
marketing executive : smaller ?
user interface designer : smaller . just like when you are writing on a letter .
project manager : but that is not th the you when you at a foreign audience , you b do not gonna wr write small .
user interface designer : a as you saw on this drawing , just open this one or that one . it is th it , we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons , it is almost impossible to get clear when you are
project manager : but maybe there is some function with no , it is not . with
user interface designer : and the eraser was another problem . it w t is this large . and when you try to erase this line , y
project manager : i am gonna erase my name .
user interface designer : i am gonna erase my name there .
project manager : it is a big eraser .
marketing executive : new ideas ?
user interface designer : m abo what new ideas ?
project manager : the idea of the touch - screen is
marketing executive : do you ?
project manager : i am just
user interface designer : new ideas about the working of this software , about the project , about the remote controls or
marketing executive : .
project manager : i what .
user interface designer : hello .
marketing executive : did you heard what he said ? i do not i what . , i have some figure . the eva the evaluation , the mean number is one point eight six .
project manager : that is interesting .
marketing executive : so that is fairly good , .
project manager : because what does it mean ?
user interface designer : so true .
marketing executive : that
project manager : all the mo , are between one and two .
marketing executive : all the requirements are true or very true , right .
project manager : . but the new ideas found for wi with working with this software ?
user interface designer : not really , just they have to improve it .
project manager : not really , ?
user interface designer : the concept is , but it has to be quicker . , it is still opening my programme , n almo almost my entire computer is locked up during the process and it , just takes too many time . people will still feel the need to write it quickly on a page and not download it and save it , and
project manager : you had expected it to be more
user interface designer : more user - friendly . when you use a pen , you can just draw like you d draw normally , and you do
marketing executive : may maybe the idea you proposed is a screen here . and draw it , and it is placed over there .
user interface designer : that l would be easier . or at least when you do not have to adapt to the technology , just you can write in the way you normally write . and now you have to keep constantly in mind that you are drawing on this screen .
marketing executive : ?
user interface designer : and that is a very bad concept .
marketing executive : very bad .
user interface designer : nah , i it is my opinion that i
marketing executive : this is better than regular flip - overs ,
user interface designer : it is can be saved easier . but if you are in normal flip - over you a lot of people write text . there is no text option . and writing text , you have got ta really do your best to write some
project manager : and maybe some functions for circle or a square . you have to draw it yourself now .
user interface designer : or maybe even insert picture . if you have some presentation , and you have some f
industrial designer : or text function . just t type text , and that would be excellent . mean
marketing executive : but insert image is not available ?
user interface designer : then you could
marketing executive : here . picture from scanner , clip - art .
project manager : that can be done already . but not the predefined squares
user interface designer : so you can
marketing executive : hyperlink ? hey , what if you do like hyperlink ?
user interface designer : with w_w _ dot google dot com .
marketing executive : type type it ?
user interface designer : maybe .
marketing executive : re real reaction dot n_l _ . yes , is now is .
user interface designer : you will just make a link in
project manager : that is .
user interface designer : there is one way to
project manager : is it
marketing executive : double - click it .
user interface designer : maybe if you are not using the eraser
project manager : here .
marketing executive : you are erasing .
user interface designer : something else th , arrow .
project manager : .
marketing executive : double - click it .
project manager : so you have
user interface designer : it is
project manager : as you saw , you have a little , you can you can go there . so there the functionality is there , but it is not ideal , and it is very it costs a lot of time to
user interface designer : to use , .
project manager : to use . and that is a pity , if you have thirty , forty minutes for this things , and we are now with four people ,
user interface designer : and that is m
project manager : but it , imagine you are here you are with the ten people and everyone
user interface designer : that is mostly the case , from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case , and if you have to do all this kind
project manager : two minutes of drawing , .
user interface designer : you will rather use powerpoint and work it out in advance . and th the one or two things you have to draw when you are there , just use a flip - board .
marketing executive : what i really miss also is a d is a turtle is a decision system like with the evaluation , you have to polls like , what do you want , a one , a two , maybe a l a little application like give your own number and click one two three four five six seven .
project manager : just like he said with the a screen which you can write , also a voting mechanism .
marketing executive : j ju , v voting application . just a little group decision application .
industrial designer : but , problem is , you ca not discuss anything you ca you can , but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now . we w one person s maybe said three . but , i we said , no i w th think two , because this and this , and then you can react on it . but if you put a three on it , just figure , everybody knows what i am knowing , so they will all just put a two on .
marketing executive : . but , you can still discuss about it ,
industrial designer : but it would .
marketing executive : but click it in an application , that is a lot easier to process .
industrial designer : the for processing part .
marketing executive : the digit .
industrial designer : but then , the idea of one person entering it and the rest discussing it , that is not that bad idea , actually . not that your opinion is not valued , but still .
project manager : so
user interface designer : yo , manager .
marketing executive : that is it ?
project manager : just about ,
user interface designer : when are w
project manager : because
user interface designer : when are we going to produce it ?
project manager : tomorrow ? , the costs are within the budget .
marketing executive : celebration .
project manager : the project is evaluated . but , before we going to celebrate , i have a little question which you ca not answer , because there must be some end report . i am busy with the end report right now . you might thinking what the hell was he doing
marketing executive : what is an end report ?
project manager : about all the meetings , what we have decided , a r a report of this day . , that must be made , but i , here is standing whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is
marketing executive : you ha you have ten minutes left , i read . you have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report .
project manager : that can be done . maybe we can do it together . you can see what i have so i s i will put it on a story - board . you can see it . because it will it must be
marketing executive : you you already made a beta version , or
project manager : it is a three with seventy five
marketing executive : pages .
project manager : just about .
industrial designer : y yikes . seventy five pages .
project manager : just a moment .
marketing executive : daniel . do you want a chair maybe ?
user interface designer : a chairman .
project manager : no no ,
marketing executive : hey ?
project manager : you can s you can read it and here it is .
industrial designer : so you finished it actually , and so we just have to read it and say yes or no ?
project manager : this not nit it read - only . but it is not fully finished yet .
marketing executive : five minutes for finishing .
project manager : this is about the functional design , the things .
marketing executive : management expert , you have to change that .
project manager : i am when i said it , i remember i had it here .
marketing executive : marketing .
user interface designer : it is a read - only version .
marketing executive : but you can save it u the under another name .
project manager : marketing expert , about the three functions where which are most used and which must immediately be visible on our remote control . , it must be simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people . so , this is really about wh what kind things must be in it and
marketing executive : maybe the
project manager : i understand you , talk a little bit dutch .
marketing executive : the you . no , you have to put , switch channels at the top , because that is the most used function and teletext at the second
project manager : oka , i really did not knew that .
marketing executive : nay , a volume changing , second .
project manager : so , this one is first .
marketing executive : s switch , yes .
project manager : you go there and you go there .
marketing executive : go on .
project manager : maybe then do it one two three .
marketing executive : yes , very good .
user interface designer : one two three .
project manager : if the order is in is important , that is the word for .
marketing executive : the order .
project manager : then the conceptual design . , all the things we have discussed , the energy , which turn out to be batteries , so that is
user interface designer : maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost .
project manager : because . , he here it is still double - curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable .
marketing executive : single - curves .
project manager : the buttons
industrial designer : it is not double .
user interface designer : a single - curved .
industrial designer : it is not double anymore , ?
project manager : not double anymore .
marketing executive : no , .
project manager : nay but that this is what
marketing executive : was initial , the plan . the initial plan .
project manager : and the added functions like tetris snake , it is under the parental control , the touch - screen . so , it is just a summary of what we had discussed
industrial designer : on thing one small thing , the added functions . , was it included in the cost ?
user interface designer : it is very cheap .
project manager : it is very cheap ,
industrial designer : it is very cheap .
project manager : you maybe you come at
marketing executive : no , it is not very cheap , but that
project manager : it is very necessary .
marketing executive : no , but it is a development inside corporation . like , w we do not have to buy parental control . our own people can make that , .
project manager : but it still has some
marketing executive : it has some cost , but
project manager : . , but so we can discuss that
user interface designer : he will do it in his free time . so
project manager : we can discuss that things with the board of
user interface designer : of directur or directors .
project manager : what is it what is the company called ? keep forgetting it .
marketing executive : real reaction .
project manager : real reaction . real reaction , .
user interface designer : you can ask your personal
project manager : so anybody misses something here about
user interface designer : the end conclusion .
project manager : that is what i am gonna write b between now .
marketing executive : . still the end conclusion . that is all , .
project manager : but , i in here nothing
user interface designer : the decision to make the buttons on the top , and the menu on the
project manager :  .
user interface designer : on the bottom . and clearly , touch - screen you have mentioned .
project manager : touch - screen i have mentioned .
marketing executive : but the decisions are put in the conclusion , . why we decided to use a flat l_c_d _ .
user interface designer : this n .
project manager : i gonna redesign something now .
user interface designer : party party .
project manager : because it will , five minutes from to finish meeting .
user interface designer : before you change anything maybe you save it first .
marketing executive : save it .
user interface designer : you ca not you can select file and export and then those j _ peg files .
marketing executive : but then you had the same thing .
user interface designer : eight . and we have , another blank one .
marketing executive : example of children remote .
user interface designer : did we change anything ? it is a new commercial logo .
marketing executive : that is a pity .
user interface designer : do not save it , aye ?
project manager : that is , tim . finish meeting now . , i am
user interface designer : why are only the first five smartboard files
project manager : i am going to finish my end report .
user interface designer : saved ?
industrial designer : hereby is the meeting is finished .
marketing executive : you declare .
project manager : i am the one who can say that . hereby the meeting is finished .","the project manager opened the meeting and went over the agenda . the user interface designer and the industrial designer presented their prototype design , describing the shape and layout of the remote . the group discussed colour options and decided to make the standard remote in fruity colours , but with the option of buying different exchangeable covers which might appeal more to older buyers . the marketing expert led the prototype evaluation and the group were happy with their product . the group calculated the production costs . the group were 4 euros over budget , so they decided to make the case single-curved and not to use kinetic energy . the project manager led the evaluation of the project process . the group felt that only the industrial designer and the user interface designer were able to be creative and work as a team . it was felt that the first meeting was disorganised because of poor leadership but the leadership improved in the later meetings . the group were also had problems with the digital pens . the group helped the project manager fill in the final report before the close of the meeting . the project manager will finish the final report . the remote will come in fruity colours as standard with the option of buying different exchangeable covers . the case will be single-curved instead of double-curved . the remote will be battery powered and will no longer use kinetic energy . the production costs were 4 euros over budget . which features should be changed to reduce production costs . there were not enough opportunities for creativity and teamwork . the digital pens did not work very well .
","the project manager opened the meeting and then the user interface designer and industrial designer presented the prototype they created , showing how the device could be used as a telephone remote . the marketing expert gave an evaluation of the prototype and the team discussed the options for components and materials which would make the device easier to use in the hand and to keep the price under 12 and a half euro . after the meeting the project manger discussed the finances of the project , which were calculated using the group's calculations on the smartboard and presented an excel file containing the total cost of the remote , and the group discussed their initial ideas for the device , as well as features they wanted to incorporate into the design . they also had problems with the meeting because of the schedule and had to finish the meeting early and were instructed to fill out the final questionnaire and had not received enough time to discuss their ideas in the meeting-room equipment . all participants will fill out an evaluation at the end of the meeting , the team members will receive a final questionnaire at the remote the remote will have a single touch-screen device with a small display and curved panel . there will be only one remote which will be two colors available in the product , one for the basic remote and another for the advanced menu . a second prototype and second a discussion of the possibility of making a more advanced technologically innovative device than the other devices available for people . once again the group decided that the cost of components was not sufficiently to be .",x,x,,,,x,,,6.0,T5-Cons
72,"project manager : i will until you are all hooked up .
marketing executive : good grief .
project manager : put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you have had fun .
user interface designer : after lunch .
project manager : right this is our conceptual design meeting ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : we are slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting ,
industrial designer : i was getting that impression as .
project manager : i th . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user - interface and trend - watching .
industrial designer : etcetera .
marketing executive :  .
project manager : so we have touched on a few things to do with that already , but we will just go over it . the minutes from the last time . we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we could not use teletext , it was not gonna be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we have decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what is normal . we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what is normal , . you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , things like that , and our market was going to be young , business , range . , so shall we start with the first presentation ?
marketing executive : shall i ?
project manager : yes if you feel
marketing executive : we just connect up . so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . the methods we used to decide on current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with a hundred subjects and the general feedback from them is that the most i m w i am slightly tongue - tied after lunch ,
project manager : it is .
marketing executive : project manager . we decided on the most important aspect i required in a remote control device and we will come to that later . so that was one of the first things we did . also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan . so the general findings from that was in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the current functional look and feel of remote controls . they also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . now i should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it is third in order of preference for the subject group we looked at . , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , we found from our consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? there also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , again in contrast to last year . so a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan . be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
project manager : very much . let is start from the inside and work our way out .
user interface designer : fine . it is with me .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : unless anyone has any questions about that ?
project manager : i do not , not yet .
marketing executive : not yet ?
project manager : yes , .
industrial designer : that screwed in ?
project manager : i hate those little things especially if you do them on too tight and you ca not get the leverage on them to undo them .
marketing executive : i know .
industrial designer : this is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . , first the into the method . the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the t_v _ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . also in this study i have looked into the availability of some of the materials , some of the things that we looked at last time are not un unfortunately are not available . , findings , i have got my little picture there . this is the chip called the t_a _ double one eight three five which is what is used in every remote control it sends out standard signals , based on your input and it is used for all t_v _ remotes at the moment . and then we are loo looking into battery options . there is actually no rechargeable option available , so we i saw the standard double a _ and triple a _ which we thought were a bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , that might be a bit silly to be honest ,
project manager : wa can you explain that ?
industrial designer : people wo not it is like wind - up radio .
project manager : like a right , .
industrial designer : so you wind up your remote control before you use it .
project manager : how what how l long can you get out of that ,
industrial designer : it might
project manager : can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that is it for the night ? or
industrial designer : you , i presu you would not have to wind it for very long , but i do not think it is really necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the solar charging , most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when you got t_v _ .
project manager : that does not count though does it ?
marketing executive : does does light charge as sunlight does ?
project manager : it was u_v _ like
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : artificial light ?
industrial designer : is it ? alright i
project manager : any , any
marketing executive : has to be solar .
user interface designer : regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple a _ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space .
industrial designer : it would the d the dynamo would take more space you actually need a physical handle to wind up .
project manager : i am pretty that solar is from the sun . , i do not think it counts electric lights
marketing executive : artificial light , no .
project manager : no , but not many you do not want to limit your market .
marketing executive : that is going to
project manager : people who live in basement flats there is not that many people , but there are people .
marketing executive : i know ,
industrial designer : but
marketing executive : different parts of the world too , if we are marketing internationally .
user interface designer : right .
industrial designer : and most people also watch t_v _ in the night anyway .
user interface designer : night .
project manager : but then it would be charging through the day , that it charges through the day and then you have got it charged for the evening .
industrial designer : but the next one is the best anyway . the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches
project manager : i have seen
industrial designer : and you d you do not even notice it . the amount of probably moving around you would be doing all the time would charge it up , i do not think you would ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .
user interface designer : and are these like what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ?
industrial designer : it is it charges into some form of it is a smaller cell which it charges into and the si the size a watch battery , they use them quite frequently in watches . and that will that would l would last for i do i d i am not entirely how long it would last but i have never seen one run out .
user interface designer : we c
project manager : but then if you think about a watch , it is on your wrist so it is on your whole bod it is on your body the whole time so you are walking around , you are doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . if you would
industrial designer : and
project manager : you switch the t_v _ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side .
industrial designer : but then again
project manager : is it really gonna be enough ?
industrial designer : it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it is only a tiny amount it is always moving for the whole day and they do not run out over night when you leave them on the side . and th for the same reason , you are only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you are finished with it
project manager : so it is not the draw on it is not
industrial designer : and you put it no i do i do not think the draw on it would be
marketing executive :  . could ask referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with standard batteries ? , could people put standard batteries in but with a s they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging
industrial designer : ye i th g y you could have a dual power thing
marketing executive : or the two things not compatible ?
project manager : like a dual .
industrial designer : but the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they are qui they are quite big and they all look i identical .
marketing executive : so that affects the exterior design .
user interface designer : solar would be slightly expensives .
project manager : expensive as . what price are we looking at for
industrial designer : they are they are expensive , they do not
user interface designer : it is twelve point f
project manager : i presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?
industrial designer : the normal batteries would be the cheapest i would presume then it would actually be the solar charging ones , but the it is i they are not very resistant to dropping ,
project manager : solar .
industrial designer : if you drop if you have y
project manager : they are not designed
industrial designer : the size you would need to charge a remote would not be that big but if remotes always get thrown around and , so .
project manager : practical - wise .
industrial designer : y , practically . calculators you do not really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do ,
project manager : you do get a bit of wear
industrial designer : they can t
project manager : but do not calculators have a battery in them as ?
industrial designer : they do , they they have got dual things , but they are the batteries are smaller .
user interface designer : another question is like
marketing executive : again it de
user interface designer : w w which one would last the longest , because we do not want customers to be like charging like a mobile phone every day . a remote control , like ,
industrial designer : w m
user interface designer : so we have to s look at the life also .
industrial designer : so the s if you had something du using the standard batteries and the solar charging , i do not think you would the it would d how long the standard double a_s would last in or triple a_s would last .
marketing executive : it would just detract from the attractiveness of the whole feature ,
industrial designer : i it would , .
marketing executive : i it is not gonna add anything , .
project manager : can we add in an attachment to closing feature ? can we think about that ? if we are doing the kinetic thing and it is
marketing executive : should not we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i personally
project manager : add it in to think about
marketing executive : right , .
project manager : because , where am i ? if it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people do not do we are doing something original and different but if you wore it if it is something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you would not lose it so much . but then maybe that is looking at someone who is just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of the controls .
marketing executive : it is not something that is come up in any of our focus groups and market research ,
project manager : no .
marketing executive : it is not a thing that people are looking for
user interface designer : so
marketing executive : when we threw it open to the field . but it is something to put on the side to think about maybe .
project manager : right .
industrial designer : i will move on .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : my second part of my findings the mo most current remotes use this silicone p_c_b _ board which pr printed circuit board , which has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it will connect the circuit and each switch is connected to two different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it is fired out of this l_e_d _ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .
project manager : what things do we have to consider there ? can we what size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of
industrial designer : this the thi the thing about is they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can print circuit board like that it is simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . if you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , if you wanted to there is an option to do it like that , or you could have some array of switches which i will speak about in the next bit so that and then to , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . now what i was thinking about that was sometimes when y when you have these things , they have got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a t_v _ remote , but you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds of not being used i would have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . , the case material , i have a been sent what the factory can actually give us , there is the plastic which we were gonna go for anyway as the main case housing the main problems with the you could go for wood but it would be a bit impractical . titanium very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , and rubber , you are saying that people like this spongy feel this year , so perhaps some something made of rubber , but i was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they have said that they have put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it is meant to be anti r_s_i _ . i am no i am not how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that is what they said . the problem with the casing is that there is quite a few design restrictions that they have got on the shape of the case . if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can be a little more they can do curved shapes . but whether or not because we would have it in two separate units
user interface designer : second thing is
project manager : hinged , .
industrial designer : for the flip phone .
user interface designer : and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . so in this case if you are looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red like that . so is that feature available in like titanium ,
industrial designer : i th
user interface designer : or it is like only specific to plastic or
industrial designer : in titanium i do not think it would be available really , the ju just it w you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is it is light and strong but it should be left for aircraft design rather than for a remote .
marketing executive : it does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . i have got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over ,
industrial designer : rubber , .
marketing executive : that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to have different fasciae for the phone .
industrial designer : and you can peel them off .
project manager : so instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber ,
marketing executive : like a rubber sleeve almost , .
user interface designer : something like
project manager : like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can pull that off .
user interface designer : alright . that could be a good idea . it could it would be comfortable to hold on also .
industrial designer : t
marketing executive : very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .
project manager : that is been really popular with mobile phones so i do not see why not .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : also the just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , i kno we were planning to do some touch screen . now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p_c_b _ circuit board and i am you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option . the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but that an l_c_d _ type of screen one they are incredibly thin and do not take up much space , two they you can have them in a array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a set thing and you could have them like a touch
user interface designer : i did not get the last part , you are talking of
industrial designer : display . what
user interface designer : just what you said i did not get the meaning of it completely , you are saying like
industrial designer : on the l_c_d _ screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it is that it is flat and so you ca not do lots of curve curved things with it , but you can you would not have with the l_c_d _ you would have the wires coming off , you would not have that with the l_c_d _ , you would only have that with the printed circuit board . with w also with the
marketing executive : i do not s to interrupt , i do not see why the curved thing is a problem , if we had a shell , once we open that
project manager : it would be flat inside .
industrial designer : you could have a flat screen inside ,
marketing executive : so it would be f , .
industrial designer : but i am just wondering whether we want an l_c_d _ screen inside .
marketing executive : have i misunderstood you ?
industrial designer : it would not be like full colour , it would just be black and white , but there would be touch buttons , so you would not be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti - r_s_i _ .
project manager : it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .
industrial designer : is rubber .
project manager : now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press ,
industrial designer : i had not really thought of that to be honest .
marketing executive : had another idea , i if it helps with that , but just to do with the r_s_i _ . is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to .
industrial designer : you could , you could have some stylus that you could pull out
project manager : like one of the palm pop thing .
industrial designer : but they could get a bit easily lost ,
user interface designer : f for somebody who very often , if he would
industrial designer : i had
project manager : it would have to be attached .
marketing executive : they are easy to replace as , cheap .
user interface designer : a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch - pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .
marketing executive : just a thought they would not actually need one and they could use anything they have got , could not they ? a pencil or a pen , so they would not really need a
project manager : we will talk about that so if you finish your
industrial designer : that is
project manager : and we will come back to that .
industrial designer : that is the end of m my
project manager : that is you , right .
user interface designer : and just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip - top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like .
industrial designer : that would be fairly simple , you would actually have two separate you would have two separate circuit boards but they would be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , in the actual flip bit you would have some linking .
marketing executive : i will just raise another point while it occurs to me , it applies to both our designers here , so i am not how it would fit in . if we flip open , now how you have got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ? and they respond to the turn of your body . is it possible that when we open our flip - top shell it is a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th the remote control display thing .
project manager : we are marketing to guys as much as we are to women .
marketing executive : they do not look at themselves ? just a thought .
project manager : it is a remote control , you were sitting watching t_v _ are you gonna want to open it and say shit i should go and have a shower and do my hair before i put the t _
marketing executive : i you mean , it is with us using the ideas for a mobile ph it is with us using the ideas for mobile phones i kinda got sidetracked onto that , .
project manager : no .
marketing executive : trying to think of other features we can build in that would not cost too much but maybe we will leave that one on the side .
industrial designer : you can you could do it , you could have a if you just put the full charge through an l_c_d _ display it will completely blank it out , but i if you could get any mirror effect on it , i am not about
marketing executive : forget about the mirror
project manager : .
marketing executive : that was just a very quick passing thought .
user interface designer : would like to share something which i did here . first thing is on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . so y you generally see there is not much of variety and like marketing team said , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . so you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous designs here . and second thing is there is too much of confusion here . no particular remote is standard . like , some people have a here you see this ? this is on a i found th that only common feature is the ch channel control and volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all . , and second as already discussed with william , we are going to have m maybe a g _ g_u_i _ interface in the f in the middle of the flip - top and g graphic user interface
marketing executive : what does that stand for ?
project manager : which means
user interface designer : which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , which is
industrial designer : if you if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer : like you have on a l icons y you have is a good example of g_u_i _ graphic user interface . so not point or click press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . and on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer . so we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .
project manager : can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? if you are thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone .
marketing executive : no you would hold it you do not if you flip it open then you would be would not you ? is not that the idea ? you us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you have got your l_c_d _ display there and you have got the buttons there so you are holding it in the palm of your hand , .
project manager : that is what i was just saying ,
industrial designer : but you can do it with your thumb li
user interface designer : but
project manager : and then have the l_c_d _ at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls ,
user interface designer : and you mean to the
project manager : so have the volume and the programme , things like that ,
user interface designer : and the lower distance .
project manager : on the lower side .
user interface designer : f perfect . so the findings are too many cluttered buttons . repetition of certain but buttons which i already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . all are confusing and in inconsistent . we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . we have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , but for like we had g s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . so it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers i am here . some thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also ? and technologically innovative also . so we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . my personal preferences would be like , as already marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so i would not say the design should be like a fruit , but we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , red chilli tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like , i if you see the previous slide
industrial designer : we
user interface designer : most of the users would now be acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls .
project manager : i ca not see that , is that play and stop and things ?
user interface designer : this is central one , the one you
project manager : or is that volume and channel ?
user interface designer : volume and channel . so keep that m that standardised because that is the most common feature across all models , if you look the models , it is here . this and voice recognition .
project manager : right . i am not how long we have got left , but we need to make a decision about the things we have discussed . so , we agree on do we agree on the battery ?
user interface designer : the kinetic .
marketing executive : kinetic ?
project manager : that means that there is no function for li the port , that it sits in , then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . it is a bi i it is like a g it is a gadget , it is a
industrial designer : if it is qui it is quite a feature to have
project manager : selling point .
industrial designer : and also if they have got it if they have got these parts already in stock , then it wo not be cheap to re - manufacture them , or it will be cheap to re - manufacture them . so do you reckon that is a good idea that , where is the remote , i am here thing ? that would be quite fun .
project manager : the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it is going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , but we have used cheap relatively cheap and simple things . the l_c_d _ is not cheap .
industrial designer : to s th it is not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour if we have just got a black and white one , they use them in calculators so .
user interface designer : maybe we could start with the black and white . that that way we could upgrade later .
project manager : and you could
marketing executive : we talked about kinetic charging , we have deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double a _ or triple a _ batteries ?
industrial designer : you cou .
project manager : do you want like a back - up ?
marketing executive : no , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double a _ or triple a _ batteries they have still got to be charged this way have not they ?
industrial designer : k no the kinetic ones come with a w watch a battery that goes in a watch .
marketing executive : i see . right , got you .
industrial designer : so it is a lot smaller , so it would
marketing executive : got you on that , did not realise .
project manager : so we have got battery . the inside components is pretty standardised across the board is not it ? so there is not a really a decision to be made there , . the buttons what did you give us as our the bare - board l_c_d _ or
industrial designer : the were we are going for the l_c_d _ on that one , on the buttons , on the top one we are gonna
project manager : on the top one you have got the touch and then
industrial designer : on the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti - r_s_i _ ones .
marketing executive : could you repeat that last part ?
industrial designer : on we have got the flip - screen , the top one is gonna be the l_c_d _ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons .
marketing executive : l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer : and for the
project manager : no , it is fine .
user interface designer : for the body design plastic , w
industrial designer : plastic ,
user interface designer : we could use the body ,
project manager : for the inside .
user interface designer : for the inside and rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design .
marketing executive :  , so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs ,
user interface designer : plast right .
project manager : so , so .
marketing executive : and it is just although it is rubberised and spongy , apart from that we are just going to go for vegetable and fruit colours , we are not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed ,
industrial designer : no .
project manager : no i
marketing executive : just go for the colours .
user interface designer : it is
project manager : we do not wanna be tacky if we have got a different shape anyway the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it psychedelic , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , but that is not really what we are focusing on , what we are focusing on is the m
marketing executive : the feel .
project manager : yes . so we could just pick anything .
marketing executive : is that going to be this image i have got in my head of something shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that is spongy . is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research ,
user interface designer : i it is different .
project manager : it is just different
marketing executive : is that fancy ?
project manager : it is just different from everything else and , i am trying to imagine clean looking houses , beige and black so you either want something that goes with that , which is what is on the market anyway , or you want something that contrasts as like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they are so interesting and
marketing executive : i am just pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but i agree . we looked at those remotes , they are anonymous , very similar looking things . this would definitely be different enough , wondered if anybody could come up with something even more
project manager : and you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little
marketing executive : the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year is time we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming it is so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on ,
project manager : and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes
marketing executive : which is another beauty of it .
project manager : y , you could just go so far with it ,
industrial designer : you can you can just
user interface designer : acupressure , you could talk of acupressures .
project manager : like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever , so that is quite a flexible thing .
user interface designer : and finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside ,
project manager : yes .
user interface designer : it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time .
industrial designer : j with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .
user interface designer : .
project manager : we have got five minutes , or that might have been up for a while .
user interface designer : fine .
marketing executive : so can recap sarah , for the decisions that we have made , kinetic charging , the watch - type batteries , l_c_d _ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we are gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . that is how far we have got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ?
user interface designer : fine , we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it remote control if it is lost . so , are we looking at voice ?
marketing executive : yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it is a good idea we just need to check on the cost ,
user interface designer : or maybe like william was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains .
marketing executive : is that right ?
user interface designer : for l , the whistle .
industrial designer : the whistle ones , .
user interface designer : so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle .
marketing executive : and incorporating the company logo ?
project manager : have you
user interface designer : i did not mention this , but we will be incorporating in the design .
marketing executive : i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y your report , it is not just a case of having a little r_r _ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it is our product
project manager : they do ,
marketing executive : do not they ?
project manager : but we can you could
marketing executive : since it is the only one of its kind on the market it is gonna be ours .
project manager : it is , you just address that with advertising . , you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you . it will have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . that it is got to stand out somehow differently but it does , without that so i am not worried about that .
marketing executive : did we i know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?
project manager : depending on how i
industrial designer : depending on the expense of it .
project manager : we have got this memo saying that it is something that the company is looking into , so
industrial designer : and they have got in stock , so .
project manager : that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it is hugely expensive we would have to cut down somewhere else , then it is worth thinking about . but we will find out more about cost afterwards . right i am going to wrap it up there . i got a end meeting now message on my mo
industrial designer : did it ?
project manager : so .
user interface designer : again a questionnaire ?
project manager : so we have probably got it says , closing we have forty minutes
marketing executive : you got to go through .
project manager : so we have probably got about that time before we come back . it is either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and how long that took .
user interface designer : we are pretty going in a clear direction now .
project manager : is everyone happy ?","the project manager reviewed the decisions from the previous meeting . the marketing expert made a presentation on trend watching , including trends in user requirements and trends in fashion . the industrial designer presented all the components of the device and announced that several of the features already discussed would not be available . he suggested substituting a kinetic battery for the rechargeable batteries and using a combination of rubber and plastic for the materials . the user interface designer presented his main interface design , which included buttons for the most frequently used features and a graphic user interface on the lcd screen for other functions , to keep frequently used features easy to use . he announced that speech recognition was still an option to consider , depending on price . the project manager then began a discussion to decide what was going into the final design . it was decided that a kinetic battery would be used in place of a rechargeable battery , that the remote will feature an lcd screen and rubber casing and rubber buttons , and that interchangeable rubber covers in fruit colors will be available . speech recognition may be included if it is not too costly . it was decided that the remote would feature an lcd screen , rubber buttons , colorful rubber changeable skins , a kinetic battery , and possibly speech recognition if it is still within the budget to include it . several of the features that the group had wanted to integrate into the design were either too costly or unavailable due to new limitations from the factory . the group had to change many of the original design elements to an alternative .
","the project manager opened the meeting by going over the minutes of the previous meeting . the marketing expert presented the results of a trend watching exercise in paris and milan , which showed that people want a fancy look and feel for a remote control device , as well as a technologically innovative and easy-to-use feature . fruit and vegetables are the current fashion for clothes , shoes and furniture , and a spongy feel to materials is a popular choice for remotes . they decided to leave out the voice recognition teletext , leaving out the option to use a flip design , flip-over function , a scroll wheel for recharging and an lcd screen . a buzzer will be included in the remote . voice recognition will not be used . there will be no lprecie-b .",x,,,x,,x,,,4.0,T5-Baseline
73,"project manager : i will until you are all hooked up .
marketing executive : good grief .
project manager : put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you have had fun .
user interface designer : after lunch .
project manager : right this is our conceptual design meeting ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : we are slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting ,
industrial designer : i was getting that impression as .
project manager : i th . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user - interface and trend - watching .
industrial designer : etcetera .
marketing executive :  .
project manager : so we have touched on a few things to do with that already , but we will just go over it . the minutes from the last time . we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we could not use teletext , it was not gonna be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we have decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what is normal . we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what is normal , . you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , things like that , and our market was going to be young , business , range . , so shall we start with the first presentation ?
marketing executive : shall i ?
project manager : yes if you feel
marketing executive : we just connect up . so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . the methods we used to decide on current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with a hundred subjects and the general feedback from them is that the most i m w i am slightly tongue - tied after lunch ,
project manager : it is .
marketing executive : project manager . we decided on the most important aspect i required in a remote control device and we will come to that later . so that was one of the first things we did . also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan . so the general findings from that was in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the current functional look and feel of remote controls . they also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . now i should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it is third in order of preference for the subject group we looked at . , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , we found from our consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? there also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , again in contrast to last year . so a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan . be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
project manager : very much . let is start from the inside and work our way out .
user interface designer : fine . it is with me .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : unless anyone has any questions about that ?
project manager : i do not , not yet .
marketing executive : not yet ?
project manager : yes , .
industrial designer : that screwed in ?
project manager : i hate those little things especially if you do them on too tight and you ca not get the leverage on them to undo them .
marketing executive : i know .
industrial designer : this is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . , first the into the method . the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the t_v _ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . also in this study i have looked into the availability of some of the materials , some of the things that we looked at last time are not un unfortunately are not available . , findings , i have got my little picture there . this is the chip called the t_a _ double one eight three five which is what is used in every remote control it sends out standard signals , based on your input and it is used for all t_v _ remotes at the moment . and then we are loo looking into battery options . there is actually no rechargeable option available , so we i saw the standard double a _ and triple a _ which we thought were a bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , that might be a bit silly to be honest ,
project manager : wa can you explain that ?
industrial designer : people wo not it is like wind - up radio .
project manager : like a right , .
industrial designer : so you wind up your remote control before you use it .
project manager : how what how l long can you get out of that ,
industrial designer : it might
project manager : can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that is it for the night ? or
industrial designer : you , i presu you would not have to wind it for very long , but i do not think it is really necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the solar charging , most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when you got t_v _ .
project manager : that does not count though does it ?
marketing executive : does does light charge as sunlight does ?
project manager : it was u_v _ like
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : artificial light ?
industrial designer : is it ? alright i
project manager : any , any
marketing executive : has to be solar .
user interface designer : regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple a _ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space .
industrial designer : it would the d the dynamo would take more space you actually need a physical handle to wind up .
project manager : i am pretty that solar is from the sun . , i do not think it counts electric lights
marketing executive : artificial light , no .
project manager : no , but not many you do not want to limit your market .
marketing executive : that is going to
project manager : people who live in basement flats there is not that many people , but there are people .
marketing executive : i know ,
industrial designer : but
marketing executive : different parts of the world too , if we are marketing internationally .
user interface designer : right .
industrial designer : and most people also watch t_v _ in the night anyway .
user interface designer : night .
project manager : but then it would be charging through the day , that it charges through the day and then you have got it charged for the evening .
industrial designer : but the next one is the best anyway . the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches
project manager : i have seen
industrial designer : and you d you do not even notice it . the amount of probably moving around you would be doing all the time would charge it up , i do not think you would ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .
user interface designer : and are these like what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ?
industrial designer : it is it charges into some form of it is a smaller cell which it charges into and the si the size a watch battery , they use them quite frequently in watches . and that will that would l would last for i do i d i am not entirely how long it would last but i have never seen one run out .
user interface designer : we c
project manager : but then if you think about a watch , it is on your wrist so it is on your whole bod it is on your body the whole time so you are walking around , you are doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . if you would
industrial designer : and
project manager : you switch the t_v _ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side .
industrial designer : but then again
project manager : is it really gonna be enough ?
industrial designer : it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it is only a tiny amount it is always moving for the whole day and they do not run out over night when you leave them on the side . and th for the same reason , you are only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you are finished with it
project manager : so it is not the draw on it is not
industrial designer : and you put it no i do i do not think the draw on it would be
marketing executive :  . could ask referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with standard batteries ? , could people put standard batteries in but with a s they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging
industrial designer : ye i th g y you could have a dual power thing
marketing executive : or the two things not compatible ?
project manager : like a dual .
industrial designer : but the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they are qui they are quite big and they all look i identical .
marketing executive : so that affects the exterior design .
user interface designer : solar would be slightly expensives .
project manager : expensive as . what price are we looking at for
industrial designer : they are they are expensive , they do not
user interface designer : it is twelve point f
project manager : i presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?
industrial designer : the normal batteries would be the cheapest i would presume then it would actually be the solar charging ones , but the it is i they are not very resistant to dropping ,
project manager : solar .
industrial designer : if you drop if you have y
project manager : they are not designed
industrial designer : the size you would need to charge a remote would not be that big but if remotes always get thrown around and , so .
project manager : practical - wise .
industrial designer : y , practically . calculators you do not really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do ,
project manager : you do get a bit of wear
industrial designer : they can t
project manager : but do not calculators have a battery in them as ?
industrial designer : they do , they they have got dual things , but they are the batteries are smaller .
user interface designer : another question is like
marketing executive : again it de
user interface designer : w w which one would last the longest , because we do not want customers to be like charging like a mobile phone every day . a remote control , like ,
industrial designer : w m
user interface designer : so we have to s look at the life also .
industrial designer : so the s if you had something du using the standard batteries and the solar charging , i do not think you would the it would d how long the standard double a_s would last in or triple a_s would last .
marketing executive : it would just detract from the attractiveness of the whole feature ,
industrial designer : i it would , .
marketing executive : i it is not gonna add anything , .
project manager : can we add in an attachment to closing feature ? can we think about that ? if we are doing the kinetic thing and it is
marketing executive : should not we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i personally
project manager : add it in to think about
marketing executive : right , .
project manager : because , where am i ? if it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people do not do we are doing something original and different but if you wore it if it is something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you would not lose it so much . but then maybe that is looking at someone who is just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of the controls .
marketing executive : it is not something that is come up in any of our focus groups and market research ,
project manager : no .
marketing executive : it is not a thing that people are looking for
user interface designer : so
marketing executive : when we threw it open to the field . but it is something to put on the side to think about maybe .
project manager : right .
industrial designer : i will move on .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : my second part of my findings the mo most current remotes use this silicone p_c_b _ board which pr printed circuit board , which has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it will connect the circuit and each switch is connected to two different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it is fired out of this l_e_d _ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .
project manager : what things do we have to consider there ? can we what size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of
industrial designer : this the thi the thing about is they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can print circuit board like that it is simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . if you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , if you wanted to there is an option to do it like that , or you could have some array of switches which i will speak about in the next bit so that and then to , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . now what i was thinking about that was sometimes when y when you have these things , they have got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a t_v _ remote , but you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds of not being used i would have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . , the case material , i have a been sent what the factory can actually give us , there is the plastic which we were gonna go for anyway as the main case housing the main problems with the you could go for wood but it would be a bit impractical . titanium very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , and rubber , you are saying that people like this spongy feel this year , so perhaps some something made of rubber , but i was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they have said that they have put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it is meant to be anti r_s_i _ . i am no i am not how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that is what they said . the problem with the casing is that there is quite a few design restrictions that they have got on the shape of the case . if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can be a little more they can do curved shapes . but whether or not because we would have it in two separate units
user interface designer : second thing is
project manager : hinged , .
industrial designer : for the flip phone .
user interface designer : and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . so in this case if you are looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red like that . so is that feature available in like titanium ,
industrial designer : i th
user interface designer : or it is like only specific to plastic or
industrial designer : in titanium i do not think it would be available really , the ju just it w you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is it is light and strong but it should be left for aircraft design rather than for a remote .
marketing executive : it does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . i have got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over ,
industrial designer : rubber , .
marketing executive : that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to have different fasciae for the phone .
industrial designer : and you can peel them off .
project manager : so instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber ,
marketing executive : like a rubber sleeve almost , .
user interface designer : something like
project manager : like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can pull that off .
user interface designer : alright . that could be a good idea . it could it would be comfortable to hold on also .
industrial designer : t
marketing executive : very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .
project manager : that is been really popular with mobile phones so i do not see why not .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : also the just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , i kno we were planning to do some touch screen . now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p_c_b _ circuit board and i am you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option . the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but that an l_c_d _ type of screen one they are incredibly thin and do not take up much space , two they you can have them in a array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a set thing and you could have them like a touch
user interface designer : i did not get the last part , you are talking of
industrial designer : display . what
user interface designer : just what you said i did not get the meaning of it completely , you are saying like
industrial designer : on the l_c_d _ screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it is that it is flat and so you ca not do lots of curve curved things with it , but you can you would not have with the l_c_d _ you would have the wires coming off , you would not have that with the l_c_d _ , you would only have that with the printed circuit board . with w also with the
marketing executive : i do not s to interrupt , i do not see why the curved thing is a problem , if we had a shell , once we open that
project manager : it would be flat inside .
industrial designer : you could have a flat screen inside ,
marketing executive : so it would be f , .
industrial designer : but i am just wondering whether we want an l_c_d _ screen inside .
marketing executive : have i misunderstood you ?
industrial designer : it would not be like full colour , it would just be black and white , but there would be touch buttons , so you would not be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti - r_s_i _ .
project manager : it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .
industrial designer : is rubber .
project manager : now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press ,
industrial designer : i had not really thought of that to be honest .
marketing executive : had another idea , i if it helps with that , but just to do with the r_s_i _ . is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to .
industrial designer : you could , you could have some stylus that you could pull out
project manager : like one of the palm pop thing .
industrial designer : but they could get a bit easily lost ,
user interface designer : f for somebody who very often , if he would
industrial designer : i had
project manager : it would have to be attached .
marketing executive : they are easy to replace as , cheap .
user interface designer : a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch - pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .
marketing executive : just a thought they would not actually need one and they could use anything they have got , could not they ? a pencil or a pen , so they would not really need a
project manager : we will talk about that so if you finish your
industrial designer : that is
project manager : and we will come back to that .
industrial designer : that is the end of m my
project manager : that is you , right .
user interface designer : and just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip - top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like .
industrial designer : that would be fairly simple , you would actually have two separate you would have two separate circuit boards but they would be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , in the actual flip bit you would have some linking .
marketing executive : i will just raise another point while it occurs to me , it applies to both our designers here , so i am not how it would fit in . if we flip open , now how you have got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ? and they respond to the turn of your body . is it possible that when we open our flip - top shell it is a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th the remote control display thing .
project manager : we are marketing to guys as much as we are to women .
marketing executive : they do not look at themselves ? just a thought .
project manager : it is a remote control , you were sitting watching t_v _ are you gonna want to open it and say shit i should go and have a shower and do my hair before i put the t _
marketing executive : i you mean , it is with us using the ideas for a mobile ph it is with us using the ideas for mobile phones i kinda got sidetracked onto that , .
project manager : no .
marketing executive : trying to think of other features we can build in that would not cost too much but maybe we will leave that one on the side .
industrial designer : you can you could do it , you could have a if you just put the full charge through an l_c_d _ display it will completely blank it out , but i if you could get any mirror effect on it , i am not about
marketing executive : forget about the mirror
project manager : .
marketing executive : that was just a very quick passing thought .
user interface designer : would like to share something which i did here . first thing is on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . so y you generally see there is not much of variety and like marketing team said , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . so you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous designs here . and second thing is there is too much of confusion here . no particular remote is standard . like , some people have a here you see this ? this is on a i found th that only common feature is the ch channel control and volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all . , and second as already discussed with william , we are going to have m maybe a g _ g_u_i _ interface in the f in the middle of the flip - top and g graphic user interface
marketing executive : what does that stand for ?
project manager : which means
user interface designer : which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , which is
industrial designer : if you if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer : like you have on a l icons y you have is a good example of g_u_i _ graphic user interface . so not point or click press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . and on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer . so we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .
project manager : can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? if you are thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone .
marketing executive : no you would hold it you do not if you flip it open then you would be would not you ? is not that the idea ? you us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you have got your l_c_d _ display there and you have got the buttons there so you are holding it in the palm of your hand , .
project manager : that is what i was just saying ,
industrial designer : but you can do it with your thumb li
user interface designer : but
project manager : and then have the l_c_d _ at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls ,
user interface designer : and you mean to the
project manager : so have the volume and the programme , things like that ,
user interface designer : and the lower distance .
project manager : on the lower side .
user interface designer : f perfect . so the findings are too many cluttered buttons . repetition of certain but buttons which i already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . all are confusing and in inconsistent . we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . we have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , but for like we had g s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . so it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers i am here . some thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also ? and technologically innovative also . so we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . my personal preferences would be like , as already marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so i would not say the design should be like a fruit , but we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , red chilli tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like , i if you see the previous slide
industrial designer : we
user interface designer : most of the users would now be acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls .
project manager : i ca not see that , is that play and stop and things ?
user interface designer : this is central one , the one you
project manager : or is that volume and channel ?
user interface designer : volume and channel . so keep that m that standardised because that is the most common feature across all models , if you look the models , it is here . this and voice recognition .
project manager : right . i am not how long we have got left , but we need to make a decision about the things we have discussed . so , we agree on do we agree on the battery ?
user interface designer : the kinetic .
marketing executive : kinetic ?
project manager : that means that there is no function for li the port , that it sits in , then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . it is a bi i it is like a g it is a gadget , it is a
industrial designer : if it is qui it is quite a feature to have
project manager : selling point .
industrial designer : and also if they have got it if they have got these parts already in stock , then it wo not be cheap to re - manufacture them , or it will be cheap to re - manufacture them . so do you reckon that is a good idea that , where is the remote , i am here thing ? that would be quite fun .
project manager : the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it is going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , but we have used cheap relatively cheap and simple things . the l_c_d _ is not cheap .
industrial designer : to s th it is not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour if we have just got a black and white one , they use them in calculators so .
user interface designer : maybe we could start with the black and white . that that way we could upgrade later .
project manager : and you could
marketing executive : we talked about kinetic charging , we have deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double a _ or triple a _ batteries ?
industrial designer : you cou .
project manager : do you want like a back - up ?
marketing executive : no , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double a _ or triple a _ batteries they have still got to be charged this way have not they ?
industrial designer : k no the kinetic ones come with a w watch a battery that goes in a watch .
marketing executive : i see . right , got you .
industrial designer : so it is a lot smaller , so it would
marketing executive : got you on that , did not realise .
project manager : so we have got battery . the inside components is pretty standardised across the board is not it ? so there is not a really a decision to be made there , . the buttons what did you give us as our the bare - board l_c_d _ or
industrial designer : the were we are going for the l_c_d _ on that one , on the buttons , on the top one we are gonna
project manager : on the top one you have got the touch and then
industrial designer : on the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti - r_s_i _ ones .
marketing executive : could you repeat that last part ?
industrial designer : on we have got the flip - screen , the top one is gonna be the l_c_d _ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons .
marketing executive : l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer : and for the
project manager : no , it is fine .
user interface designer : for the body design plastic , w
industrial designer : plastic ,
user interface designer : we could use the body ,
project manager : for the inside .
user interface designer : for the inside and rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design .
marketing executive :  , so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs ,
user interface designer : plast right .
project manager : so , so .
marketing executive : and it is just although it is rubberised and spongy , apart from that we are just going to go for vegetable and fruit colours , we are not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed ,
industrial designer : no .
project manager : no i
marketing executive : just go for the colours .
user interface designer : it is
project manager : we do not wanna be tacky if we have got a different shape anyway the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it psychedelic , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , but that is not really what we are focusing on , what we are focusing on is the m
marketing executive : the feel .
project manager : yes . so we could just pick anything .
marketing executive : is that going to be this image i have got in my head of something shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that is spongy . is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research ,
user interface designer : i it is different .
project manager : it is just different
marketing executive : is that fancy ?
project manager : it is just different from everything else and , i am trying to imagine clean looking houses , beige and black so you either want something that goes with that , which is what is on the market anyway , or you want something that contrasts as like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they are so interesting and
marketing executive : i am just pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but i agree . we looked at those remotes , they are anonymous , very similar looking things . this would definitely be different enough , wondered if anybody could come up with something even more
project manager : and you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little
marketing executive : the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year is time we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming it is so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on ,
project manager : and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes
marketing executive : which is another beauty of it .
project manager : y , you could just go so far with it ,
industrial designer : you can you can just
user interface designer : acupressure , you could talk of acupressures .
project manager : like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever , so that is quite a flexible thing .
user interface designer : and finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside ,
project manager : yes .
user interface designer : it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time .
industrial designer : j with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .
user interface designer : .
project manager : we have got five minutes , or that might have been up for a while .
user interface designer : fine .
marketing executive : so can recap sarah , for the decisions that we have made , kinetic charging , the watch - type batteries , l_c_d _ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we are gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . that is how far we have got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ?
user interface designer : fine , we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it remote control if it is lost . so , are we looking at voice ?
marketing executive : yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it is a good idea we just need to check on the cost ,
user interface designer : or maybe like william was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains .
marketing executive : is that right ?
user interface designer : for l , the whistle .
industrial designer : the whistle ones , .
user interface designer : so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle .
marketing executive : and incorporating the company logo ?
project manager : have you
user interface designer : i did not mention this , but we will be incorporating in the design .
marketing executive : i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y your report , it is not just a case of having a little r_r _ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it is our product
project manager : they do ,
marketing executive : do not they ?
project manager : but we can you could
marketing executive : since it is the only one of its kind on the market it is gonna be ours .
project manager : it is , you just address that with advertising . , you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you . it will have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . that it is got to stand out somehow differently but it does , without that so i am not worried about that .
marketing executive : did we i know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?
project manager : depending on how i
industrial designer : depending on the expense of it .
project manager : we have got this memo saying that it is something that the company is looking into , so
industrial designer : and they have got in stock , so .
project manager : that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it is hugely expensive we would have to cut down somewhere else , then it is worth thinking about . but we will find out more about cost afterwards . right i am going to wrap it up there . i got a end meeting now message on my mo
industrial designer : did it ?
project manager : so .
user interface designer : again a questionnaire ?
project manager : so we have probably got it says , closing we have forty minutes
marketing executive : you got to go through .
project manager : so we have probably got about that time before we come back . it is either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and how long that took .
user interface designer : we are pretty going in a clear direction now .
project manager : is everyone happy ?","the project manager reviewed the decisions from the previous meeting . the marketing expert made a presentation on trend watching , including trends in user requirements and trends in fashion . the industrial designer presented all the components of the device and announced that several of the features already discussed would not be available . he suggested substituting a kinetic battery for the rechargeable batteries and using a combination of rubber and plastic for the materials . the user interface designer presented his main interface design , which included buttons for the most frequently used features and a graphic user interface on the lcd screen for other functions , to keep frequently used features easy to use . he announced that speech recognition was still an option to consider , depending on price . the project manager then began a discussion to decide what was going into the final design . it was decided that a kinetic battery would be used in place of a rechargeable battery , that the remote will feature an lcd screen and rubber casing and rubber buttons , and that interchangeable rubber covers in fruit colors will be available . speech recognition may be included if it is not too costly . it was decided that the remote would feature an lcd screen , rubber buttons , colorful rubber changeable skins , a kinetic battery , and possibly speech recognition if it is still within the budget to include it . several of the features that the group had wanted to integrate into the design were either too costly or unavailable due to new limitations from the factory . the group had to change many of the original design elements to an alternative .
","the project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting . the marketing expert presented findings from trend watching studies , which indicated that users want a fancy look and feel , a technological innovation , and a ease of use . the trends also indicated that fruit and vegetable themes are popular among younger consumers , and thus the team should incorporate the theme of fruit and vegetables into their design . the industrial designer presented the interior workings of a remote and discussed options for materials and components . the user interface designer discussed what functions would be controlled through buttons or the lcd screen menu . the group discussed voice recognition , what shape the remote should be , and the option to include a rechargable battery with a locator function . the program manager briefed the team on the new requirements and led them in a discussion in which the team discussed and decided on various features to include in the remote . the team members will work on their individual work the team will not work with teletext . the remote will only be used for televisions . the corporate image must be incorporated into the design of the device . the case will be single-curved . the device will be made of plastic with rubber grips . the batteries will be rechargeable",x,,,,,,,,8.0,BART-Cons
74,"project manager : i will until you are all hooked up .
marketing executive : good grief .
project manager : put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you have had fun .
user interface designer : after lunch .
project manager : right this is our conceptual design meeting ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : we are slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting ,
industrial designer : i was getting that impression as .
project manager : i th . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user - interface and trend - watching .
industrial designer : etcetera .
marketing executive :  .
project manager : so we have touched on a few things to do with that already , but we will just go over it . the minutes from the last time . we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we could not use teletext , it was not gonna be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we have decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what is normal . we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what is normal , . you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , things like that , and our market was going to be young , business , range . , so shall we start with the first presentation ?
marketing executive : shall i ?
project manager : yes if you feel
marketing executive : we just connect up . so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . the methods we used to decide on current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with a hundred subjects and the general feedback from them is that the most i m w i am slightly tongue - tied after lunch ,
project manager : it is .
marketing executive : project manager . we decided on the most important aspect i required in a remote control device and we will come to that later . so that was one of the first things we did . also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan . so the general findings from that was in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the current functional look and feel of remote controls . they also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . now i should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it is third in order of preference for the subject group we looked at . , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , we found from our consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? there also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , again in contrast to last year . so a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan . be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
project manager : very much . let is start from the inside and work our way out .
user interface designer : fine . it is with me .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : unless anyone has any questions about that ?
project manager : i do not , not yet .
marketing executive : not yet ?
project manager : yes , .
industrial designer : that screwed in ?
project manager : i hate those little things especially if you do them on too tight and you ca not get the leverage on them to undo them .
marketing executive : i know .
industrial designer : this is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . , first the into the method . the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the t_v _ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . also in this study i have looked into the availability of some of the materials , some of the things that we looked at last time are not un unfortunately are not available . , findings , i have got my little picture there . this is the chip called the t_a _ double one eight three five which is what is used in every remote control it sends out standard signals , based on your input and it is used for all t_v _ remotes at the moment . and then we are loo looking into battery options . there is actually no rechargeable option available , so we i saw the standard double a _ and triple a _ which we thought were a bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , that might be a bit silly to be honest ,
project manager : wa can you explain that ?
industrial designer : people wo not it is like wind - up radio .
project manager : like a right , .
industrial designer : so you wind up your remote control before you use it .
project manager : how what how l long can you get out of that ,
industrial designer : it might
project manager : can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that is it for the night ? or
industrial designer : you , i presu you would not have to wind it for very long , but i do not think it is really necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the solar charging , most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when you got t_v _ .
project manager : that does not count though does it ?
marketing executive : does does light charge as sunlight does ?
project manager : it was u_v _ like
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : artificial light ?
industrial designer : is it ? alright i
project manager : any , any
marketing executive : has to be solar .
user interface designer : regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple a _ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space .
industrial designer : it would the d the dynamo would take more space you actually need a physical handle to wind up .
project manager : i am pretty that solar is from the sun . , i do not think it counts electric lights
marketing executive : artificial light , no .
project manager : no , but not many you do not want to limit your market .
marketing executive : that is going to
project manager : people who live in basement flats there is not that many people , but there are people .
marketing executive : i know ,
industrial designer : but
marketing executive : different parts of the world too , if we are marketing internationally .
user interface designer : right .
industrial designer : and most people also watch t_v _ in the night anyway .
user interface designer : night .
project manager : but then it would be charging through the day , that it charges through the day and then you have got it charged for the evening .
industrial designer : but the next one is the best anyway . the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches
project manager : i have seen
industrial designer : and you d you do not even notice it . the amount of probably moving around you would be doing all the time would charge it up , i do not think you would ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .
user interface designer : and are these like what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ?
industrial designer : it is it charges into some form of it is a smaller cell which it charges into and the si the size a watch battery , they use them quite frequently in watches . and that will that would l would last for i do i d i am not entirely how long it would last but i have never seen one run out .
user interface designer : we c
project manager : but then if you think about a watch , it is on your wrist so it is on your whole bod it is on your body the whole time so you are walking around , you are doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . if you would
industrial designer : and
project manager : you switch the t_v _ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side .
industrial designer : but then again
project manager : is it really gonna be enough ?
industrial designer : it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it is only a tiny amount it is always moving for the whole day and they do not run out over night when you leave them on the side . and th for the same reason , you are only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you are finished with it
project manager : so it is not the draw on it is not
industrial designer : and you put it no i do i do not think the draw on it would be
marketing executive :  . could ask referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with standard batteries ? , could people put standard batteries in but with a s they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging
industrial designer : ye i th g y you could have a dual power thing
marketing executive : or the two things not compatible ?
project manager : like a dual .
industrial designer : but the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they are qui they are quite big and they all look i identical .
marketing executive : so that affects the exterior design .
user interface designer : solar would be slightly expensives .
project manager : expensive as . what price are we looking at for
industrial designer : they are they are expensive , they do not
user interface designer : it is twelve point f
project manager : i presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?
industrial designer : the normal batteries would be the cheapest i would presume then it would actually be the solar charging ones , but the it is i they are not very resistant to dropping ,
project manager : solar .
industrial designer : if you drop if you have y
project manager : they are not designed
industrial designer : the size you would need to charge a remote would not be that big but if remotes always get thrown around and , so .
project manager : practical - wise .
industrial designer : y , practically . calculators you do not really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do ,
project manager : you do get a bit of wear
industrial designer : they can t
project manager : but do not calculators have a battery in them as ?
industrial designer : they do , they they have got dual things , but they are the batteries are smaller .
user interface designer : another question is like
marketing executive : again it de
user interface designer : w w which one would last the longest , because we do not want customers to be like charging like a mobile phone every day . a remote control , like ,
industrial designer : w m
user interface designer : so we have to s look at the life also .
industrial designer : so the s if you had something du using the standard batteries and the solar charging , i do not think you would the it would d how long the standard double a_s would last in or triple a_s would last .
marketing executive : it would just detract from the attractiveness of the whole feature ,
industrial designer : i it would , .
marketing executive : i it is not gonna add anything , .
project manager : can we add in an attachment to closing feature ? can we think about that ? if we are doing the kinetic thing and it is
marketing executive : should not we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i personally
project manager : add it in to think about
marketing executive : right , .
project manager : because , where am i ? if it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people do not do we are doing something original and different but if you wore it if it is something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you would not lose it so much . but then maybe that is looking at someone who is just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of the controls .
marketing executive : it is not something that is come up in any of our focus groups and market research ,
project manager : no .
marketing executive : it is not a thing that people are looking for
user interface designer : so
marketing executive : when we threw it open to the field . but it is something to put on the side to think about maybe .
project manager : right .
industrial designer : i will move on .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : my second part of my findings the mo most current remotes use this silicone p_c_b _ board which pr printed circuit board , which has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it will connect the circuit and each switch is connected to two different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it is fired out of this l_e_d _ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .
project manager : what things do we have to consider there ? can we what size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of
industrial designer : this the thi the thing about is they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can print circuit board like that it is simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . if you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , if you wanted to there is an option to do it like that , or you could have some array of switches which i will speak about in the next bit so that and then to , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . now what i was thinking about that was sometimes when y when you have these things , they have got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a t_v _ remote , but you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds of not being used i would have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . , the case material , i have a been sent what the factory can actually give us , there is the plastic which we were gonna go for anyway as the main case housing the main problems with the you could go for wood but it would be a bit impractical . titanium very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , and rubber , you are saying that people like this spongy feel this year , so perhaps some something made of rubber , but i was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they have said that they have put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it is meant to be anti r_s_i _ . i am no i am not how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that is what they said . the problem with the casing is that there is quite a few design restrictions that they have got on the shape of the case . if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can be a little more they can do curved shapes . but whether or not because we would have it in two separate units
user interface designer : second thing is
project manager : hinged , .
industrial designer : for the flip phone .
user interface designer : and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . so in this case if you are looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red like that . so is that feature available in like titanium ,
industrial designer : i th
user interface designer : or it is like only specific to plastic or
industrial designer : in titanium i do not think it would be available really , the ju just it w you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is it is light and strong but it should be left for aircraft design rather than for a remote .
marketing executive : it does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . i have got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over ,
industrial designer : rubber , .
marketing executive : that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to have different fasciae for the phone .
industrial designer : and you can peel them off .
project manager : so instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber ,
marketing executive : like a rubber sleeve almost , .
user interface designer : something like
project manager : like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can pull that off .
user interface designer : alright . that could be a good idea . it could it would be comfortable to hold on also .
industrial designer : t
marketing executive : very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .
project manager : that is been really popular with mobile phones so i do not see why not .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : also the just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , i kno we were planning to do some touch screen . now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p_c_b _ circuit board and i am you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option . the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but that an l_c_d _ type of screen one they are incredibly thin and do not take up much space , two they you can have them in a array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a set thing and you could have them like a touch
user interface designer : i did not get the last part , you are talking of
industrial designer : display . what
user interface designer : just what you said i did not get the meaning of it completely , you are saying like
industrial designer : on the l_c_d _ screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it is that it is flat and so you ca not do lots of curve curved things with it , but you can you would not have with the l_c_d _ you would have the wires coming off , you would not have that with the l_c_d _ , you would only have that with the printed circuit board . with w also with the
marketing executive : i do not s to interrupt , i do not see why the curved thing is a problem , if we had a shell , once we open that
project manager : it would be flat inside .
industrial designer : you could have a flat screen inside ,
marketing executive : so it would be f , .
industrial designer : but i am just wondering whether we want an l_c_d _ screen inside .
marketing executive : have i misunderstood you ?
industrial designer : it would not be like full colour , it would just be black and white , but there would be touch buttons , so you would not be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti - r_s_i _ .
project manager : it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .
industrial designer : is rubber .
project manager : now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press ,
industrial designer : i had not really thought of that to be honest .
marketing executive : had another idea , i if it helps with that , but just to do with the r_s_i _ . is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to .
industrial designer : you could , you could have some stylus that you could pull out
project manager : like one of the palm pop thing .
industrial designer : but they could get a bit easily lost ,
user interface designer : f for somebody who very often , if he would
industrial designer : i had
project manager : it would have to be attached .
marketing executive : they are easy to replace as , cheap .
user interface designer : a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch - pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .
marketing executive : just a thought they would not actually need one and they could use anything they have got , could not they ? a pencil or a pen , so they would not really need a
project manager : we will talk about that so if you finish your
industrial designer : that is
project manager : and we will come back to that .
industrial designer : that is the end of m my
project manager : that is you , right .
user interface designer : and just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip - top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like .
industrial designer : that would be fairly simple , you would actually have two separate you would have two separate circuit boards but they would be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , in the actual flip bit you would have some linking .
marketing executive : i will just raise another point while it occurs to me , it applies to both our designers here , so i am not how it would fit in . if we flip open , now how you have got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ? and they respond to the turn of your body . is it possible that when we open our flip - top shell it is a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th the remote control display thing .
project manager : we are marketing to guys as much as we are to women .
marketing executive : they do not look at themselves ? just a thought .
project manager : it is a remote control , you were sitting watching t_v _ are you gonna want to open it and say shit i should go and have a shower and do my hair before i put the t _
marketing executive : i you mean , it is with us using the ideas for a mobile ph it is with us using the ideas for mobile phones i kinda got sidetracked onto that , .
project manager : no .
marketing executive : trying to think of other features we can build in that would not cost too much but maybe we will leave that one on the side .
industrial designer : you can you could do it , you could have a if you just put the full charge through an l_c_d _ display it will completely blank it out , but i if you could get any mirror effect on it , i am not about
marketing executive : forget about the mirror
project manager : .
marketing executive : that was just a very quick passing thought .
user interface designer : would like to share something which i did here . first thing is on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . so y you generally see there is not much of variety and like marketing team said , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . so you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous designs here . and second thing is there is too much of confusion here . no particular remote is standard . like , some people have a here you see this ? this is on a i found th that only common feature is the ch channel control and volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all . , and second as already discussed with william , we are going to have m maybe a g _ g_u_i _ interface in the f in the middle of the flip - top and g graphic user interface
marketing executive : what does that stand for ?
project manager : which means
user interface designer : which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , which is
industrial designer : if you if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer : like you have on a l icons y you have is a good example of g_u_i _ graphic user interface . so not point or click press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . and on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer . so we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .
project manager : can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? if you are thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone .
marketing executive : no you would hold it you do not if you flip it open then you would be would not you ? is not that the idea ? you us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you have got your l_c_d _ display there and you have got the buttons there so you are holding it in the palm of your hand , .
project manager : that is what i was just saying ,
industrial designer : but you can do it with your thumb li
user interface designer : but
project manager : and then have the l_c_d _ at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls ,
user interface designer : and you mean to the
project manager : so have the volume and the programme , things like that ,
user interface designer : and the lower distance .
project manager : on the lower side .
user interface designer : f perfect . so the findings are too many cluttered buttons . repetition of certain but buttons which i already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . all are confusing and in inconsistent . we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . we have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , but for like we had g s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . so it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers i am here . some thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also ? and technologically innovative also . so we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . my personal preferences would be like , as already marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so i would not say the design should be like a fruit , but we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , red chilli tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like , i if you see the previous slide
industrial designer : we
user interface designer : most of the users would now be acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls .
project manager : i ca not see that , is that play and stop and things ?
user interface designer : this is central one , the one you
project manager : or is that volume and channel ?
user interface designer : volume and channel . so keep that m that standardised because that is the most common feature across all models , if you look the models , it is here . this and voice recognition .
project manager : right . i am not how long we have got left , but we need to make a decision about the things we have discussed . so , we agree on do we agree on the battery ?
user interface designer : the kinetic .
marketing executive : kinetic ?
project manager : that means that there is no function for li the port , that it sits in , then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . it is a bi i it is like a g it is a gadget , it is a
industrial designer : if it is qui it is quite a feature to have
project manager : selling point .
industrial designer : and also if they have got it if they have got these parts already in stock , then it wo not be cheap to re - manufacture them , or it will be cheap to re - manufacture them . so do you reckon that is a good idea that , where is the remote , i am here thing ? that would be quite fun .
project manager : the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it is going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , but we have used cheap relatively cheap and simple things . the l_c_d _ is not cheap .
industrial designer : to s th it is not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour if we have just got a black and white one , they use them in calculators so .
user interface designer : maybe we could start with the black and white . that that way we could upgrade later .
project manager : and you could
marketing executive : we talked about kinetic charging , we have deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double a _ or triple a _ batteries ?
industrial designer : you cou .
project manager : do you want like a back - up ?
marketing executive : no , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double a _ or triple a _ batteries they have still got to be charged this way have not they ?
industrial designer : k no the kinetic ones come with a w watch a battery that goes in a watch .
marketing executive : i see . right , got you .
industrial designer : so it is a lot smaller , so it would
marketing executive : got you on that , did not realise .
project manager : so we have got battery . the inside components is pretty standardised across the board is not it ? so there is not a really a decision to be made there , . the buttons what did you give us as our the bare - board l_c_d _ or
industrial designer : the were we are going for the l_c_d _ on that one , on the buttons , on the top one we are gonna
project manager : on the top one you have got the touch and then
industrial designer : on the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti - r_s_i _ ones .
marketing executive : could you repeat that last part ?
industrial designer : on we have got the flip - screen , the top one is gonna be the l_c_d _ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons .
marketing executive : l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer : and for the
project manager : no , it is fine .
user interface designer : for the body design plastic , w
industrial designer : plastic ,
user interface designer : we could use the body ,
project manager : for the inside .
user interface designer : for the inside and rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design .
marketing executive :  , so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs ,
user interface designer : plast right .
project manager : so , so .
marketing executive : and it is just although it is rubberised and spongy , apart from that we are just going to go for vegetable and fruit colours , we are not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed ,
industrial designer : no .
project manager : no i
marketing executive : just go for the colours .
user interface designer : it is
project manager : we do not wanna be tacky if we have got a different shape anyway the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it psychedelic , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , but that is not really what we are focusing on , what we are focusing on is the m
marketing executive : the feel .
project manager : yes . so we could just pick anything .
marketing executive : is that going to be this image i have got in my head of something shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that is spongy . is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research ,
user interface designer : i it is different .
project manager : it is just different
marketing executive : is that fancy ?
project manager : it is just different from everything else and , i am trying to imagine clean looking houses , beige and black so you either want something that goes with that , which is what is on the market anyway , or you want something that contrasts as like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they are so interesting and
marketing executive : i am just pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but i agree . we looked at those remotes , they are anonymous , very similar looking things . this would definitely be different enough , wondered if anybody could come up with something even more
project manager : and you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little
marketing executive : the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year is time we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming it is so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on ,
project manager : and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes
marketing executive : which is another beauty of it .
project manager : y , you could just go so far with it ,
industrial designer : you can you can just
user interface designer : acupressure , you could talk of acupressures .
project manager : like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever , so that is quite a flexible thing .
user interface designer : and finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside ,
project manager : yes .
user interface designer : it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time .
industrial designer : j with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .
user interface designer : .
project manager : we have got five minutes , or that might have been up for a while .
user interface designer : fine .
marketing executive : so can recap sarah , for the decisions that we have made , kinetic charging , the watch - type batteries , l_c_d _ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we are gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . that is how far we have got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ?
user interface designer : fine , we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it remote control if it is lost . so , are we looking at voice ?
marketing executive : yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it is a good idea we just need to check on the cost ,
user interface designer : or maybe like william was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains .
marketing executive : is that right ?
user interface designer : for l , the whistle .
industrial designer : the whistle ones , .
user interface designer : so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle .
marketing executive : and incorporating the company logo ?
project manager : have you
user interface designer : i did not mention this , but we will be incorporating in the design .
marketing executive : i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y your report , it is not just a case of having a little r_r _ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it is our product
project manager : they do ,
marketing executive : do not they ?
project manager : but we can you could
marketing executive : since it is the only one of its kind on the market it is gonna be ours .
project manager : it is , you just address that with advertising . , you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you . it will have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . that it is got to stand out somehow differently but it does , without that so i am not worried about that .
marketing executive : did we i know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?
project manager : depending on how i
industrial designer : depending on the expense of it .
project manager : we have got this memo saying that it is something that the company is looking into , so
industrial designer : and they have got in stock , so .
project manager : that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it is hugely expensive we would have to cut down somewhere else , then it is worth thinking about . but we will find out more about cost afterwards . right i am going to wrap it up there . i got a end meeting now message on my mo
industrial designer : did it ?
project manager : so .
user interface designer : again a questionnaire ?
project manager : so we have probably got it says , closing we have forty minutes
marketing executive : you got to go through .
project manager : so we have probably got about that time before we come back . it is either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and how long that took .
user interface designer : we are pretty going in a clear direction now .
project manager : is everyone happy ?","the project manager reviewed the decisions from the previous meeting . the marketing expert made a presentation on trend watching , including trends in user requirements and trends in fashion . the industrial designer presented all the components of the device and announced that several of the features already discussed would not be available . he suggested substituting a kinetic battery for the rechargeable batteries and using a combination of rubber and plastic for the materials . the user interface designer presented his main interface design , which included buttons for the most frequently used features and a graphic user interface on the lcd screen for other functions , to keep frequently used features easy to use . he announced that speech recognition was still an option to consider , depending on price . the project manager then began a discussion to decide what was going into the final design . it was decided that a kinetic battery would be used in place of a rechargeable battery , that the remote will feature an lcd screen and rubber casing and rubber buttons , and that interchangeable rubber covers in fruit colors will be available . speech recognition may be included if it is not too costly . it was decided that the remote would feature an lcd screen , rubber buttons , colorful rubber changeable skins , a kinetic battery , and possibly speech recognition if it is still within the budget to include it . several of the features that the group had wanted to integrate into the design were either too costly or unavailable due to new limitations from the factory . the group had to change many of the original design elements to an alternative .
","the project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and briefed the team on some new requirements to abide by when designing the remote . the marketing expert presented research on user preferences in terms of look and usability and discussed current trends in the market that will be incorporated into the design of the remote . the industrial designer discussed options for energy sources and materials to use when designing the remote , as well as options for buttons and the shape of the remote . the user interface designer discussed how to incorporate the corporate image into the design of the remote . the team then discussed their experiences using remote controls and what features they would like to integrate into the design of the remote . the industrial designer will work on the look and feel of the design . the user interface designer and the marketing expert will work together on a prototype . the industrial designer and the user interface designer will work together on a prototype . the marketing expert will work on a prototype evaluation . the team will evaluate the prototype according to whether or not it meets user requirements . the remote will use rechargeable batteries and be powered by a single chip . the remote will use push buttons . the case of the remote will be made of rubber . the remote will be yellow . the remote will feature an ergonomic design . the remote will have a flip-open shape . the remote will use push buttons . the remote will have an lcd screen . the remote will use rechargeable batteries and be powered by a single chip . the remote will use push buttons . the remote will",x,x,,,,x,,,6.0,Pegasus-Baseline
75,"project manager : i will until you are all hooked up .
marketing executive : good grief .
project manager : put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you have had fun .
user interface designer : after lunch .
project manager : right this is our conceptual design meeting ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : we are slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting ,
industrial designer : i was getting that impression as .
project manager : i th . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user - interface and trend - watching .
industrial designer : etcetera .
marketing executive :  .
project manager : so we have touched on a few things to do with that already , but we will just go over it . the minutes from the last time . we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we could not use teletext , it was not gonna be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we have decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what is normal . we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what is normal , . you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , things like that , and our market was going to be young , business , range . , so shall we start with the first presentation ?
marketing executive : shall i ?
project manager : yes if you feel
marketing executive : we just connect up . so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . the methods we used to decide on current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with a hundred subjects and the general feedback from them is that the most i m w i am slightly tongue - tied after lunch ,
project manager : it is .
marketing executive : project manager . we decided on the most important aspect i required in a remote control device and we will come to that later . so that was one of the first things we did . also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan . so the general findings from that was in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the current functional look and feel of remote controls . they also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . now i should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it is third in order of preference for the subject group we looked at . , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , we found from our consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? there also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , again in contrast to last year . so a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan . be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
project manager : very much . let is start from the inside and work our way out .
user interface designer : fine . it is with me .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : unless anyone has any questions about that ?
project manager : i do not , not yet .
marketing executive : not yet ?
project manager : yes , .
industrial designer : that screwed in ?
project manager : i hate those little things especially if you do them on too tight and you ca not get the leverage on them to undo them .
marketing executive : i know .
industrial designer : this is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . , first the into the method . the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the t_v _ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . also in this study i have looked into the availability of some of the materials , some of the things that we looked at last time are not un unfortunately are not available . , findings , i have got my little picture there . this is the chip called the t_a _ double one eight three five which is what is used in every remote control it sends out standard signals , based on your input and it is used for all t_v _ remotes at the moment . and then we are loo looking into battery options . there is actually no rechargeable option available , so we i saw the standard double a _ and triple a _ which we thought were a bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , that might be a bit silly to be honest ,
project manager : wa can you explain that ?
industrial designer : people wo not it is like wind - up radio .
project manager : like a right , .
industrial designer : so you wind up your remote control before you use it .
project manager : how what how l long can you get out of that ,
industrial designer : it might
project manager : can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that is it for the night ? or
industrial designer : you , i presu you would not have to wind it for very long , but i do not think it is really necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the solar charging , most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when you got t_v _ .
project manager : that does not count though does it ?
marketing executive : does does light charge as sunlight does ?
project manager : it was u_v _ like
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : artificial light ?
industrial designer : is it ? alright i
project manager : any , any
marketing executive : has to be solar .
user interface designer : regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple a _ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space .
industrial designer : it would the d the dynamo would take more space you actually need a physical handle to wind up .
project manager : i am pretty that solar is from the sun . , i do not think it counts electric lights
marketing executive : artificial light , no .
project manager : no , but not many you do not want to limit your market .
marketing executive : that is going to
project manager : people who live in basement flats there is not that many people , but there are people .
marketing executive : i know ,
industrial designer : but
marketing executive : different parts of the world too , if we are marketing internationally .
user interface designer : right .
industrial designer : and most people also watch t_v _ in the night anyway .
user interface designer : night .
project manager : but then it would be charging through the day , that it charges through the day and then you have got it charged for the evening .
industrial designer : but the next one is the best anyway . the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches
project manager : i have seen
industrial designer : and you d you do not even notice it . the amount of probably moving around you would be doing all the time would charge it up , i do not think you would ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .
user interface designer : and are these like what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ?
industrial designer : it is it charges into some form of it is a smaller cell which it charges into and the si the size a watch battery , they use them quite frequently in watches . and that will that would l would last for i do i d i am not entirely how long it would last but i have never seen one run out .
user interface designer : we c
project manager : but then if you think about a watch , it is on your wrist so it is on your whole bod it is on your body the whole time so you are walking around , you are doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . if you would
industrial designer : and
project manager : you switch the t_v _ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side .
industrial designer : but then again
project manager : is it really gonna be enough ?
industrial designer : it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it is only a tiny amount it is always moving for the whole day and they do not run out over night when you leave them on the side . and th for the same reason , you are only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you are finished with it
project manager : so it is not the draw on it is not
industrial designer : and you put it no i do i do not think the draw on it would be
marketing executive :  . could ask referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with standard batteries ? , could people put standard batteries in but with a s they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging
industrial designer : ye i th g y you could have a dual power thing
marketing executive : or the two things not compatible ?
project manager : like a dual .
industrial designer : but the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they are qui they are quite big and they all look i identical .
marketing executive : so that affects the exterior design .
user interface designer : solar would be slightly expensives .
project manager : expensive as . what price are we looking at for
industrial designer : they are they are expensive , they do not
user interface designer : it is twelve point f
project manager : i presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?
industrial designer : the normal batteries would be the cheapest i would presume then it would actually be the solar charging ones , but the it is i they are not very resistant to dropping ,
project manager : solar .
industrial designer : if you drop if you have y
project manager : they are not designed
industrial designer : the size you would need to charge a remote would not be that big but if remotes always get thrown around and , so .
project manager : practical - wise .
industrial designer : y , practically . calculators you do not really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do ,
project manager : you do get a bit of wear
industrial designer : they can t
project manager : but do not calculators have a battery in them as ?
industrial designer : they do , they they have got dual things , but they are the batteries are smaller .
user interface designer : another question is like
marketing executive : again it de
user interface designer : w w which one would last the longest , because we do not want customers to be like charging like a mobile phone every day . a remote control , like ,
industrial designer : w m
user interface designer : so we have to s look at the life also .
industrial designer : so the s if you had something du using the standard batteries and the solar charging , i do not think you would the it would d how long the standard double a_s would last in or triple a_s would last .
marketing executive : it would just detract from the attractiveness of the whole feature ,
industrial designer : i it would , .
marketing executive : i it is not gonna add anything , .
project manager : can we add in an attachment to closing feature ? can we think about that ? if we are doing the kinetic thing and it is
marketing executive : should not we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i personally
project manager : add it in to think about
marketing executive : right , .
project manager : because , where am i ? if it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people do not do we are doing something original and different but if you wore it if it is something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you would not lose it so much . but then maybe that is looking at someone who is just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of the controls .
marketing executive : it is not something that is come up in any of our focus groups and market research ,
project manager : no .
marketing executive : it is not a thing that people are looking for
user interface designer : so
marketing executive : when we threw it open to the field . but it is something to put on the side to think about maybe .
project manager : right .
industrial designer : i will move on .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : my second part of my findings the mo most current remotes use this silicone p_c_b _ board which pr printed circuit board , which has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it will connect the circuit and each switch is connected to two different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it is fired out of this l_e_d _ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .
project manager : what things do we have to consider there ? can we what size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of
industrial designer : this the thi the thing about is they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can print circuit board like that it is simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . if you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , if you wanted to there is an option to do it like that , or you could have some array of switches which i will speak about in the next bit so that and then to , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . now what i was thinking about that was sometimes when y when you have these things , they have got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a t_v _ remote , but you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds of not being used i would have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . , the case material , i have a been sent what the factory can actually give us , there is the plastic which we were gonna go for anyway as the main case housing the main problems with the you could go for wood but it would be a bit impractical . titanium very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , and rubber , you are saying that people like this spongy feel this year , so perhaps some something made of rubber , but i was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they have said that they have put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it is meant to be anti r_s_i _ . i am no i am not how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that is what they said . the problem with the casing is that there is quite a few design restrictions that they have got on the shape of the case . if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can be a little more they can do curved shapes . but whether or not because we would have it in two separate units
user interface designer : second thing is
project manager : hinged , .
industrial designer : for the flip phone .
user interface designer : and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . so in this case if you are looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red like that . so is that feature available in like titanium ,
industrial designer : i th
user interface designer : or it is like only specific to plastic or
industrial designer : in titanium i do not think it would be available really , the ju just it w you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is it is light and strong but it should be left for aircraft design rather than for a remote .
marketing executive : it does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . i have got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over ,
industrial designer : rubber , .
marketing executive : that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to have different fasciae for the phone .
industrial designer : and you can peel them off .
project manager : so instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber ,
marketing executive : like a rubber sleeve almost , .
user interface designer : something like
project manager : like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can pull that off .
user interface designer : alright . that could be a good idea . it could it would be comfortable to hold on also .
industrial designer : t
marketing executive : very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .
project manager : that is been really popular with mobile phones so i do not see why not .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : also the just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , i kno we were planning to do some touch screen . now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p_c_b _ circuit board and i am you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option . the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but that an l_c_d _ type of screen one they are incredibly thin and do not take up much space , two they you can have them in a array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a set thing and you could have them like a touch
user interface designer : i did not get the last part , you are talking of
industrial designer : display . what
user interface designer : just what you said i did not get the meaning of it completely , you are saying like
industrial designer : on the l_c_d _ screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it is that it is flat and so you ca not do lots of curve curved things with it , but you can you would not have with the l_c_d _ you would have the wires coming off , you would not have that with the l_c_d _ , you would only have that with the printed circuit board . with w also with the
marketing executive : i do not s to interrupt , i do not see why the curved thing is a problem , if we had a shell , once we open that
project manager : it would be flat inside .
industrial designer : you could have a flat screen inside ,
marketing executive : so it would be f , .
industrial designer : but i am just wondering whether we want an l_c_d _ screen inside .
marketing executive : have i misunderstood you ?
industrial designer : it would not be like full colour , it would just be black and white , but there would be touch buttons , so you would not be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti - r_s_i _ .
project manager : it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .
industrial designer : is rubber .
project manager : now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press ,
industrial designer : i had not really thought of that to be honest .
marketing executive : had another idea , i if it helps with that , but just to do with the r_s_i _ . is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to .
industrial designer : you could , you could have some stylus that you could pull out
project manager : like one of the palm pop thing .
industrial designer : but they could get a bit easily lost ,
user interface designer : f for somebody who very often , if he would
industrial designer : i had
project manager : it would have to be attached .
marketing executive : they are easy to replace as , cheap .
user interface designer : a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch - pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .
marketing executive : just a thought they would not actually need one and they could use anything they have got , could not they ? a pencil or a pen , so they would not really need a
project manager : we will talk about that so if you finish your
industrial designer : that is
project manager : and we will come back to that .
industrial designer : that is the end of m my
project manager : that is you , right .
user interface designer : and just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip - top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like .
industrial designer : that would be fairly simple , you would actually have two separate you would have two separate circuit boards but they would be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , in the actual flip bit you would have some linking .
marketing executive : i will just raise another point while it occurs to me , it applies to both our designers here , so i am not how it would fit in . if we flip open , now how you have got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ? and they respond to the turn of your body . is it possible that when we open our flip - top shell it is a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th the remote control display thing .
project manager : we are marketing to guys as much as we are to women .
marketing executive : they do not look at themselves ? just a thought .
project manager : it is a remote control , you were sitting watching t_v _ are you gonna want to open it and say shit i should go and have a shower and do my hair before i put the t _
marketing executive : i you mean , it is with us using the ideas for a mobile ph it is with us using the ideas for mobile phones i kinda got sidetracked onto that , .
project manager : no .
marketing executive : trying to think of other features we can build in that would not cost too much but maybe we will leave that one on the side .
industrial designer : you can you could do it , you could have a if you just put the full charge through an l_c_d _ display it will completely blank it out , but i if you could get any mirror effect on it , i am not about
marketing executive : forget about the mirror
project manager : .
marketing executive : that was just a very quick passing thought .
user interface designer : would like to share something which i did here . first thing is on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . so y you generally see there is not much of variety and like marketing team said , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . so you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous designs here . and second thing is there is too much of confusion here . no particular remote is standard . like , some people have a here you see this ? this is on a i found th that only common feature is the ch channel control and volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all . , and second as already discussed with william , we are going to have m maybe a g _ g_u_i _ interface in the f in the middle of the flip - top and g graphic user interface
marketing executive : what does that stand for ?
project manager : which means
user interface designer : which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , which is
industrial designer : if you if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer : like you have on a l icons y you have is a good example of g_u_i _ graphic user interface . so not point or click press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . and on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer . so we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .
project manager : can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? if you are thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone .
marketing executive : no you would hold it you do not if you flip it open then you would be would not you ? is not that the idea ? you us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you have got your l_c_d _ display there and you have got the buttons there so you are holding it in the palm of your hand , .
project manager : that is what i was just saying ,
industrial designer : but you can do it with your thumb li
user interface designer : but
project manager : and then have the l_c_d _ at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls ,
user interface designer : and you mean to the
project manager : so have the volume and the programme , things like that ,
user interface designer : and the lower distance .
project manager : on the lower side .
user interface designer : f perfect . so the findings are too many cluttered buttons . repetition of certain but buttons which i already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . all are confusing and in inconsistent . we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . we have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , but for like we had g s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . so it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers i am here . some thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also ? and technologically innovative also . so we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . my personal preferences would be like , as already marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so i would not say the design should be like a fruit , but we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , red chilli tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like , i if you see the previous slide
industrial designer : we
user interface designer : most of the users would now be acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls .
project manager : i ca not see that , is that play and stop and things ?
user interface designer : this is central one , the one you
project manager : or is that volume and channel ?
user interface designer : volume and channel . so keep that m that standardised because that is the most common feature across all models , if you look the models , it is here . this and voice recognition .
project manager : right . i am not how long we have got left , but we need to make a decision about the things we have discussed . so , we agree on do we agree on the battery ?
user interface designer : the kinetic .
marketing executive : kinetic ?
project manager : that means that there is no function for li the port , that it sits in , then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . it is a bi i it is like a g it is a gadget , it is a
industrial designer : if it is qui it is quite a feature to have
project manager : selling point .
industrial designer : and also if they have got it if they have got these parts already in stock , then it wo not be cheap to re - manufacture them , or it will be cheap to re - manufacture them . so do you reckon that is a good idea that , where is the remote , i am here thing ? that would be quite fun .
project manager : the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it is going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , but we have used cheap relatively cheap and simple things . the l_c_d _ is not cheap .
industrial designer : to s th it is not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour if we have just got a black and white one , they use them in calculators so .
user interface designer : maybe we could start with the black and white . that that way we could upgrade later .
project manager : and you could
marketing executive : we talked about kinetic charging , we have deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double a _ or triple a _ batteries ?
industrial designer : you cou .
project manager : do you want like a back - up ?
marketing executive : no , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double a _ or triple a _ batteries they have still got to be charged this way have not they ?
industrial designer : k no the kinetic ones come with a w watch a battery that goes in a watch .
marketing executive : i see . right , got you .
industrial designer : so it is a lot smaller , so it would
marketing executive : got you on that , did not realise .
project manager : so we have got battery . the inside components is pretty standardised across the board is not it ? so there is not a really a decision to be made there , . the buttons what did you give us as our the bare - board l_c_d _ or
industrial designer : the were we are going for the l_c_d _ on that one , on the buttons , on the top one we are gonna
project manager : on the top one you have got the touch and then
industrial designer : on the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti - r_s_i _ ones .
marketing executive : could you repeat that last part ?
industrial designer : on we have got the flip - screen , the top one is gonna be the l_c_d _ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons .
marketing executive : l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer : and for the
project manager : no , it is fine .
user interface designer : for the body design plastic , w
industrial designer : plastic ,
user interface designer : we could use the body ,
project manager : for the inside .
user interface designer : for the inside and rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design .
marketing executive :  , so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs ,
user interface designer : plast right .
project manager : so , so .
marketing executive : and it is just although it is rubberised and spongy , apart from that we are just going to go for vegetable and fruit colours , we are not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed ,
industrial designer : no .
project manager : no i
marketing executive : just go for the colours .
user interface designer : it is
project manager : we do not wanna be tacky if we have got a different shape anyway the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it psychedelic , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , but that is not really what we are focusing on , what we are focusing on is the m
marketing executive : the feel .
project manager : yes . so we could just pick anything .
marketing executive : is that going to be this image i have got in my head of something shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that is spongy . is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research ,
user interface designer : i it is different .
project manager : it is just different
marketing executive : is that fancy ?
project manager : it is just different from everything else and , i am trying to imagine clean looking houses , beige and black so you either want something that goes with that , which is what is on the market anyway , or you want something that contrasts as like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they are so interesting and
marketing executive : i am just pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but i agree . we looked at those remotes , they are anonymous , very similar looking things . this would definitely be different enough , wondered if anybody could come up with something even more
project manager : and you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little
marketing executive : the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year is time we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming it is so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on ,
project manager : and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes
marketing executive : which is another beauty of it .
project manager : y , you could just go so far with it ,
industrial designer : you can you can just
user interface designer : acupressure , you could talk of acupressures .
project manager : like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever , so that is quite a flexible thing .
user interface designer : and finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside ,
project manager : yes .
user interface designer : it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time .
industrial designer : j with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .
user interface designer : .
project manager : we have got five minutes , or that might have been up for a while .
user interface designer : fine .
marketing executive : so can recap sarah , for the decisions that we have made , kinetic charging , the watch - type batteries , l_c_d _ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we are gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . that is how far we have got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ?
user interface designer : fine , we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it remote control if it is lost . so , are we looking at voice ?
marketing executive : yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it is a good idea we just need to check on the cost ,
user interface designer : or maybe like william was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains .
marketing executive : is that right ?
user interface designer : for l , the whistle .
industrial designer : the whistle ones , .
user interface designer : so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle .
marketing executive : and incorporating the company logo ?
project manager : have you
user interface designer : i did not mention this , but we will be incorporating in the design .
marketing executive : i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y your report , it is not just a case of having a little r_r _ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it is our product
project manager : they do ,
marketing executive : do not they ?
project manager : but we can you could
marketing executive : since it is the only one of its kind on the market it is gonna be ours .
project manager : it is , you just address that with advertising . , you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you . it will have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . that it is got to stand out somehow differently but it does , without that so i am not worried about that .
marketing executive : did we i know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?
project manager : depending on how i
industrial designer : depending on the expense of it .
project manager : we have got this memo saying that it is something that the company is looking into , so
industrial designer : and they have got in stock , so .
project manager : that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it is hugely expensive we would have to cut down somewhere else , then it is worth thinking about . but we will find out more about cost afterwards . right i am going to wrap it up there . i got a end meeting now message on my mo
industrial designer : did it ?
project manager : so .
user interface designer : again a questionnaire ?
project manager : so we have probably got it says , closing we have forty minutes
marketing executive : you got to go through .
project manager : so we have probably got about that time before we come back . it is either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and how long that took .
user interface designer : we are pretty going in a clear direction now .
project manager : is everyone happy ?","the project manager reviewed the decisions from the previous meeting . the marketing expert made a presentation on trend watching , including trends in user requirements and trends in fashion . the industrial designer presented all the components of the device and announced that several of the features already discussed would not be available . he suggested substituting a kinetic battery for the rechargeable batteries and using a combination of rubber and plastic for the materials . the user interface designer presented his main interface design , which included buttons for the most frequently used features and a graphic user interface on the lcd screen for other functions , to keep frequently used features easy to use . he announced that speech recognition was still an option to consider , depending on price . the project manager then began a discussion to decide what was going into the final design . it was decided that a kinetic battery would be used in place of a rechargeable battery , that the remote will feature an lcd screen and rubber casing and rubber buttons , and that interchangeable rubber covers in fruit colors will be available . speech recognition may be included if it is not too costly . it was decided that the remote would feature an lcd screen , rubber buttons , colorful rubber changeable skins , a kinetic battery , and possibly speech recognition if it is still within the budget to include it . several of the features that the group had wanted to integrate into the design were either too costly or unavailable due to new limitations from the factory . the group had to change many of the original design elements to an alternative .
","the marketing expert presented the results of trend watching reports from paris and milan . they found that users want a fancy look and feel for a remote control , and that being technologically innovative and easy to use is most important . the group also discussed the look of current remotes , with a preference for fruit and vegetable themes and spongy materials . this lead to a discussion about the port and the use of a scroll wheel on the side of the device , as well as concerns about buttons being too small , which could cause the remote to lose a person if it becomes difficult to locate a lost remote , or if the remote should have an lcd screen . all participants were instructed to fill out a questionnaire and then completed the project manager instructed the user interface designer and the industrial designer to construct the prototype , the interface designer will build a prototype using a model of the prototype the new requirements for the remote and the production cost of the materials , in which they discussed the cost of components and the finalize the features to include in the design . there will be no mention of voice recognition in the new project budget; the group decided to have a flip-shaped remote rather than a larger one of the traditional rectangular remote . it will be made of rubber and not contain a rechargeable battery . having a slide-out button for the , making the remote a small corner of rubbery material .",x,,x,,,x,,,5.0,T5-Cons
76,"project manager : i will until you are all hooked up .
marketing executive : good grief .
project manager : put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you have had fun .
user interface designer : after lunch .
project manager : right this is our conceptual design meeting ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : we are slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting ,
industrial designer : i was getting that impression as .
project manager : i th . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user - interface and trend - watching .
industrial designer : etcetera .
marketing executive :  .
project manager : so we have touched on a few things to do with that already , but we will just go over it . the minutes from the last time . we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we could not use teletext , it was not gonna be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we have decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what is normal . we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what is normal , . you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , things like that , and our market was going to be young , business , range . , so shall we start with the first presentation ?
marketing executive : shall i ?
project manager : yes if you feel
marketing executive : we just connect up . so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . the methods we used to decide on current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with a hundred subjects and the general feedback from them is that the most i m w i am slightly tongue - tied after lunch ,
project manager : it is .
marketing executive : project manager . we decided on the most important aspect i required in a remote control device and we will come to that later . so that was one of the first things we did . also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan . so the general findings from that was in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the current functional look and feel of remote controls . they also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . now i should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it is third in order of preference for the subject group we looked at . , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , we found from our consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? there also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , again in contrast to last year . so a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan . be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
project manager : very much . let is start from the inside and work our way out .
user interface designer : fine . it is with me .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : unless anyone has any questions about that ?
project manager : i do not , not yet .
marketing executive : not yet ?
project manager : yes , .
industrial designer : that screwed in ?
project manager : i hate those little things especially if you do them on too tight and you ca not get the leverage on them to undo them .
marketing executive : i know .
industrial designer : this is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . , first the into the method . the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the t_v _ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . also in this study i have looked into the availability of some of the materials , some of the things that we looked at last time are not un unfortunately are not available . , findings , i have got my little picture there . this is the chip called the t_a _ double one eight three five which is what is used in every remote control it sends out standard signals , based on your input and it is used for all t_v _ remotes at the moment . and then we are loo looking into battery options . there is actually no rechargeable option available , so we i saw the standard double a _ and triple a _ which we thought were a bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , that might be a bit silly to be honest ,
project manager : wa can you explain that ?
industrial designer : people wo not it is like wind - up radio .
project manager : like a right , .
industrial designer : so you wind up your remote control before you use it .
project manager : how what how l long can you get out of that ,
industrial designer : it might
project manager : can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that is it for the night ? or
industrial designer : you , i presu you would not have to wind it for very long , but i do not think it is really necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the solar charging , most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when you got t_v _ .
project manager : that does not count though does it ?
marketing executive : does does light charge as sunlight does ?
project manager : it was u_v _ like
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : artificial light ?
industrial designer : is it ? alright i
project manager : any , any
marketing executive : has to be solar .
user interface designer : regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple a _ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space .
industrial designer : it would the d the dynamo would take more space you actually need a physical handle to wind up .
project manager : i am pretty that solar is from the sun . , i do not think it counts electric lights
marketing executive : artificial light , no .
project manager : no , but not many you do not want to limit your market .
marketing executive : that is going to
project manager : people who live in basement flats there is not that many people , but there are people .
marketing executive : i know ,
industrial designer : but
marketing executive : different parts of the world too , if we are marketing internationally .
user interface designer : right .
industrial designer : and most people also watch t_v _ in the night anyway .
user interface designer : night .
project manager : but then it would be charging through the day , that it charges through the day and then you have got it charged for the evening .
industrial designer : but the next one is the best anyway . the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches
project manager : i have seen
industrial designer : and you d you do not even notice it . the amount of probably moving around you would be doing all the time would charge it up , i do not think you would ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .
user interface designer : and are these like what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ?
industrial designer : it is it charges into some form of it is a smaller cell which it charges into and the si the size a watch battery , they use them quite frequently in watches . and that will that would l would last for i do i d i am not entirely how long it would last but i have never seen one run out .
user interface designer : we c
project manager : but then if you think about a watch , it is on your wrist so it is on your whole bod it is on your body the whole time so you are walking around , you are doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . if you would
industrial designer : and
project manager : you switch the t_v _ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side .
industrial designer : but then again
project manager : is it really gonna be enough ?
industrial designer : it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it is only a tiny amount it is always moving for the whole day and they do not run out over night when you leave them on the side . and th for the same reason , you are only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you are finished with it
project manager : so it is not the draw on it is not
industrial designer : and you put it no i do i do not think the draw on it would be
marketing executive :  . could ask referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with standard batteries ? , could people put standard batteries in but with a s they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging
industrial designer : ye i th g y you could have a dual power thing
marketing executive : or the two things not compatible ?
project manager : like a dual .
industrial designer : but the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they are qui they are quite big and they all look i identical .
marketing executive : so that affects the exterior design .
user interface designer : solar would be slightly expensives .
project manager : expensive as . what price are we looking at for
industrial designer : they are they are expensive , they do not
user interface designer : it is twelve point f
project manager : i presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?
industrial designer : the normal batteries would be the cheapest i would presume then it would actually be the solar charging ones , but the it is i they are not very resistant to dropping ,
project manager : solar .
industrial designer : if you drop if you have y
project manager : they are not designed
industrial designer : the size you would need to charge a remote would not be that big but if remotes always get thrown around and , so .
project manager : practical - wise .
industrial designer : y , practically . calculators you do not really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do ,
project manager : you do get a bit of wear
industrial designer : they can t
project manager : but do not calculators have a battery in them as ?
industrial designer : they do , they they have got dual things , but they are the batteries are smaller .
user interface designer : another question is like
marketing executive : again it de
user interface designer : w w which one would last the longest , because we do not want customers to be like charging like a mobile phone every day . a remote control , like ,
industrial designer : w m
user interface designer : so we have to s look at the life also .
industrial designer : so the s if you had something du using the standard batteries and the solar charging , i do not think you would the it would d how long the standard double a_s would last in or triple a_s would last .
marketing executive : it would just detract from the attractiveness of the whole feature ,
industrial designer : i it would , .
marketing executive : i it is not gonna add anything , .
project manager : can we add in an attachment to closing feature ? can we think about that ? if we are doing the kinetic thing and it is
marketing executive : should not we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i personally
project manager : add it in to think about
marketing executive : right , .
project manager : because , where am i ? if it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people do not do we are doing something original and different but if you wore it if it is something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you would not lose it so much . but then maybe that is looking at someone who is just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of the controls .
marketing executive : it is not something that is come up in any of our focus groups and market research ,
project manager : no .
marketing executive : it is not a thing that people are looking for
user interface designer : so
marketing executive : when we threw it open to the field . but it is something to put on the side to think about maybe .
project manager : right .
industrial designer : i will move on .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : my second part of my findings the mo most current remotes use this silicone p_c_b _ board which pr printed circuit board , which has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it will connect the circuit and each switch is connected to two different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it is fired out of this l_e_d _ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .
project manager : what things do we have to consider there ? can we what size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of
industrial designer : this the thi the thing about is they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can print circuit board like that it is simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . if you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , if you wanted to there is an option to do it like that , or you could have some array of switches which i will speak about in the next bit so that and then to , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . now what i was thinking about that was sometimes when y when you have these things , they have got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a t_v _ remote , but you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds of not being used i would have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . , the case material , i have a been sent what the factory can actually give us , there is the plastic which we were gonna go for anyway as the main case housing the main problems with the you could go for wood but it would be a bit impractical . titanium very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , and rubber , you are saying that people like this spongy feel this year , so perhaps some something made of rubber , but i was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they have said that they have put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it is meant to be anti r_s_i _ . i am no i am not how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that is what they said . the problem with the casing is that there is quite a few design restrictions that they have got on the shape of the case . if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can be a little more they can do curved shapes . but whether or not because we would have it in two separate units
user interface designer : second thing is
project manager : hinged , .
industrial designer : for the flip phone .
user interface designer : and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . so in this case if you are looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red like that . so is that feature available in like titanium ,
industrial designer : i th
user interface designer : or it is like only specific to plastic or
industrial designer : in titanium i do not think it would be available really , the ju just it w you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is it is light and strong but it should be left for aircraft design rather than for a remote .
marketing executive : it does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . i have got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over ,
industrial designer : rubber , .
marketing executive : that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to have different fasciae for the phone .
industrial designer : and you can peel them off .
project manager : so instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber ,
marketing executive : like a rubber sleeve almost , .
user interface designer : something like
project manager : like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can pull that off .
user interface designer : alright . that could be a good idea . it could it would be comfortable to hold on also .
industrial designer : t
marketing executive : very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .
project manager : that is been really popular with mobile phones so i do not see why not .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : also the just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , i kno we were planning to do some touch screen . now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p_c_b _ circuit board and i am you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option . the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but that an l_c_d _ type of screen one they are incredibly thin and do not take up much space , two they you can have them in a array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a set thing and you could have them like a touch
user interface designer : i did not get the last part , you are talking of
industrial designer : display . what
user interface designer : just what you said i did not get the meaning of it completely , you are saying like
industrial designer : on the l_c_d _ screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it is that it is flat and so you ca not do lots of curve curved things with it , but you can you would not have with the l_c_d _ you would have the wires coming off , you would not have that with the l_c_d _ , you would only have that with the printed circuit board . with w also with the
marketing executive : i do not s to interrupt , i do not see why the curved thing is a problem , if we had a shell , once we open that
project manager : it would be flat inside .
industrial designer : you could have a flat screen inside ,
marketing executive : so it would be f , .
industrial designer : but i am just wondering whether we want an l_c_d _ screen inside .
marketing executive : have i misunderstood you ?
industrial designer : it would not be like full colour , it would just be black and white , but there would be touch buttons , so you would not be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti - r_s_i _ .
project manager : it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .
industrial designer : is rubber .
project manager : now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press ,
industrial designer : i had not really thought of that to be honest .
marketing executive : had another idea , i if it helps with that , but just to do with the r_s_i _ . is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to .
industrial designer : you could , you could have some stylus that you could pull out
project manager : like one of the palm pop thing .
industrial designer : but they could get a bit easily lost ,
user interface designer : f for somebody who very often , if he would
industrial designer : i had
project manager : it would have to be attached .
marketing executive : they are easy to replace as , cheap .
user interface designer : a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch - pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .
marketing executive : just a thought they would not actually need one and they could use anything they have got , could not they ? a pencil or a pen , so they would not really need a
project manager : we will talk about that so if you finish your
industrial designer : that is
project manager : and we will come back to that .
industrial designer : that is the end of m my
project manager : that is you , right .
user interface designer : and just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip - top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like .
industrial designer : that would be fairly simple , you would actually have two separate you would have two separate circuit boards but they would be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , in the actual flip bit you would have some linking .
marketing executive : i will just raise another point while it occurs to me , it applies to both our designers here , so i am not how it would fit in . if we flip open , now how you have got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ? and they respond to the turn of your body . is it possible that when we open our flip - top shell it is a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th the remote control display thing .
project manager : we are marketing to guys as much as we are to women .
marketing executive : they do not look at themselves ? just a thought .
project manager : it is a remote control , you were sitting watching t_v _ are you gonna want to open it and say shit i should go and have a shower and do my hair before i put the t _
marketing executive : i you mean , it is with us using the ideas for a mobile ph it is with us using the ideas for mobile phones i kinda got sidetracked onto that , .
project manager : no .
marketing executive : trying to think of other features we can build in that would not cost too much but maybe we will leave that one on the side .
industrial designer : you can you could do it , you could have a if you just put the full charge through an l_c_d _ display it will completely blank it out , but i if you could get any mirror effect on it , i am not about
marketing executive : forget about the mirror
project manager : .
marketing executive : that was just a very quick passing thought .
user interface designer : would like to share something which i did here . first thing is on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . so y you generally see there is not much of variety and like marketing team said , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . so you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous designs here . and second thing is there is too much of confusion here . no particular remote is standard . like , some people have a here you see this ? this is on a i found th that only common feature is the ch channel control and volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all . , and second as already discussed with william , we are going to have m maybe a g _ g_u_i _ interface in the f in the middle of the flip - top and g graphic user interface
marketing executive : what does that stand for ?
project manager : which means
user interface designer : which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , which is
industrial designer : if you if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer : like you have on a l icons y you have is a good example of g_u_i _ graphic user interface . so not point or click press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . and on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer . so we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .
project manager : can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? if you are thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone .
marketing executive : no you would hold it you do not if you flip it open then you would be would not you ? is not that the idea ? you us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you have got your l_c_d _ display there and you have got the buttons there so you are holding it in the palm of your hand , .
project manager : that is what i was just saying ,
industrial designer : but you can do it with your thumb li
user interface designer : but
project manager : and then have the l_c_d _ at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls ,
user interface designer : and you mean to the
project manager : so have the volume and the programme , things like that ,
user interface designer : and the lower distance .
project manager : on the lower side .
user interface designer : f perfect . so the findings are too many cluttered buttons . repetition of certain but buttons which i already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . all are confusing and in inconsistent . we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . we have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , but for like we had g s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . so it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers i am here . some thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also ? and technologically innovative also . so we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . my personal preferences would be like , as already marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so i would not say the design should be like a fruit , but we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , red chilli tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like , i if you see the previous slide
industrial designer : we
user interface designer : most of the users would now be acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls .
project manager : i ca not see that , is that play and stop and things ?
user interface designer : this is central one , the one you
project manager : or is that volume and channel ?
user interface designer : volume and channel . so keep that m that standardised because that is the most common feature across all models , if you look the models , it is here . this and voice recognition .
project manager : right . i am not how long we have got left , but we need to make a decision about the things we have discussed . so , we agree on do we agree on the battery ?
user interface designer : the kinetic .
marketing executive : kinetic ?
project manager : that means that there is no function for li the port , that it sits in , then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . it is a bi i it is like a g it is a gadget , it is a
industrial designer : if it is qui it is quite a feature to have
project manager : selling point .
industrial designer : and also if they have got it if they have got these parts already in stock , then it wo not be cheap to re - manufacture them , or it will be cheap to re - manufacture them . so do you reckon that is a good idea that , where is the remote , i am here thing ? that would be quite fun .
project manager : the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it is going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , but we have used cheap relatively cheap and simple things . the l_c_d _ is not cheap .
industrial designer : to s th it is not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour if we have just got a black and white one , they use them in calculators so .
user interface designer : maybe we could start with the black and white . that that way we could upgrade later .
project manager : and you could
marketing executive : we talked about kinetic charging , we have deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double a _ or triple a _ batteries ?
industrial designer : you cou .
project manager : do you want like a back - up ?
marketing executive : no , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double a _ or triple a _ batteries they have still got to be charged this way have not they ?
industrial designer : k no the kinetic ones come with a w watch a battery that goes in a watch .
marketing executive : i see . right , got you .
industrial designer : so it is a lot smaller , so it would
marketing executive : got you on that , did not realise .
project manager : so we have got battery . the inside components is pretty standardised across the board is not it ? so there is not a really a decision to be made there , . the buttons what did you give us as our the bare - board l_c_d _ or
industrial designer : the were we are going for the l_c_d _ on that one , on the buttons , on the top one we are gonna
project manager : on the top one you have got the touch and then
industrial designer : on the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti - r_s_i _ ones .
marketing executive : could you repeat that last part ?
industrial designer : on we have got the flip - screen , the top one is gonna be the l_c_d _ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons .
marketing executive : l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer : and for the
project manager : no , it is fine .
user interface designer : for the body design plastic , w
industrial designer : plastic ,
user interface designer : we could use the body ,
project manager : for the inside .
user interface designer : for the inside and rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design .
marketing executive :  , so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs ,
user interface designer : plast right .
project manager : so , so .
marketing executive : and it is just although it is rubberised and spongy , apart from that we are just going to go for vegetable and fruit colours , we are not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed ,
industrial designer : no .
project manager : no i
marketing executive : just go for the colours .
user interface designer : it is
project manager : we do not wanna be tacky if we have got a different shape anyway the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it psychedelic , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , but that is not really what we are focusing on , what we are focusing on is the m
marketing executive : the feel .
project manager : yes . so we could just pick anything .
marketing executive : is that going to be this image i have got in my head of something shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that is spongy . is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research ,
user interface designer : i it is different .
project manager : it is just different
marketing executive : is that fancy ?
project manager : it is just different from everything else and , i am trying to imagine clean looking houses , beige and black so you either want something that goes with that , which is what is on the market anyway , or you want something that contrasts as like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they are so interesting and
marketing executive : i am just pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but i agree . we looked at those remotes , they are anonymous , very similar looking things . this would definitely be different enough , wondered if anybody could come up with something even more
project manager : and you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little
marketing executive : the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year is time we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming it is so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on ,
project manager : and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes
marketing executive : which is another beauty of it .
project manager : y , you could just go so far with it ,
industrial designer : you can you can just
user interface designer : acupressure , you could talk of acupressures .
project manager : like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever , so that is quite a flexible thing .
user interface designer : and finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside ,
project manager : yes .
user interface designer : it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time .
industrial designer : j with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .
user interface designer : .
project manager : we have got five minutes , or that might have been up for a while .
user interface designer : fine .
marketing executive : so can recap sarah , for the decisions that we have made , kinetic charging , the watch - type batteries , l_c_d _ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we are gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . that is how far we have got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ?
user interface designer : fine , we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it remote control if it is lost . so , are we looking at voice ?
marketing executive : yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it is a good idea we just need to check on the cost ,
user interface designer : or maybe like william was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains .
marketing executive : is that right ?
user interface designer : for l , the whistle .
industrial designer : the whistle ones , .
user interface designer : so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle .
marketing executive : and incorporating the company logo ?
project manager : have you
user interface designer : i did not mention this , but we will be incorporating in the design .
marketing executive : i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y your report , it is not just a case of having a little r_r _ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it is our product
project manager : they do ,
marketing executive : do not they ?
project manager : but we can you could
marketing executive : since it is the only one of its kind on the market it is gonna be ours .
project manager : it is , you just address that with advertising . , you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you . it will have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . that it is got to stand out somehow differently but it does , without that so i am not worried about that .
marketing executive : did we i know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?
project manager : depending on how i
industrial designer : depending on the expense of it .
project manager : we have got this memo saying that it is something that the company is looking into , so
industrial designer : and they have got in stock , so .
project manager : that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it is hugely expensive we would have to cut down somewhere else , then it is worth thinking about . but we will find out more about cost afterwards . right i am going to wrap it up there . i got a end meeting now message on my mo
industrial designer : did it ?
project manager : so .
user interface designer : again a questionnaire ?
project manager : so we have probably got it says , closing we have forty minutes
marketing executive : you got to go through .
project manager : so we have probably got about that time before we come back . it is either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and how long that took .
user interface designer : we are pretty going in a clear direction now .
project manager : is everyone happy ?","the project manager reviewed the decisions from the previous meeting . the marketing expert made a presentation on trend watching , including trends in user requirements and trends in fashion . the industrial designer presented all the components of the device and announced that several of the features already discussed would not be available . he suggested substituting a kinetic battery for the rechargeable batteries and using a combination of rubber and plastic for the materials . the user interface designer presented his main interface design , which included buttons for the most frequently used features and a graphic user interface on the lcd screen for other functions , to keep frequently used features easy to use . he announced that speech recognition was still an option to consider , depending on price . the project manager then began a discussion to decide what was going into the final design . it was decided that a kinetic battery would be used in place of a rechargeable battery , that the remote will feature an lcd screen and rubber casing and rubber buttons , and that interchangeable rubber covers in fruit colors will be available . speech recognition may be included if it is not too costly . it was decided that the remote would feature an lcd screen , rubber buttons , colorful rubber changeable skins , a kinetic battery , and possibly speech recognition if it is still within the budget to include it . several of the features that the group had wanted to integrate into the design were either too costly or unavailable due to new limitations from the factory . the group had to change many of the original design elements to an alternative .
","the project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and briefed the team on some new requirements to abide by . the marketing expert presented research on user preferences and tendencies in fashion and in technology . the team then discussed their target group and decided that the remote should be somewhat spongy in appearance and contain a feature to help users keep track of their remote . the industrial designer discussed options for energy sources and materials , as well as components and case shapes . the team then discussed how to incorporate the corporate image into their design . the user interface designer discussed the placement and design of the buttons and how to make the most of the company logo and the shape of the remote . the industrial designer also discussed options for batteries and materials . the team then discussed how to incorporate the corporate image into their design . the user interface designer and the industrial designer will work on a prototype . the marketing expert will work on a prototype evaluation . the team will try to find a way to incorporate the corporate image into their design . the remote will be fashionable . the corporate image must be recognizable in the design of the remote . the remote will contain a spongy material . the remote will have a flip-open design . the remote will have buttons for the following functions: on and off , channel up and down , volume up and down , and entering channel numbers . the remote will feature rechargeable batteries and a recharging stand . the",x,x,,,,,,,6.0,Pegasus-Cons
77,"project manager : i will until you are all hooked up .
marketing executive : good grief .
project manager : put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you have had fun .
user interface designer : after lunch .
project manager : right this is our conceptual design meeting ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : we are slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting ,
industrial designer : i was getting that impression as .
project manager : i th . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user - interface and trend - watching .
industrial designer : etcetera .
marketing executive :  .
project manager : so we have touched on a few things to do with that already , but we will just go over it . the minutes from the last time . we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we could not use teletext , it was not gonna be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we have decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what is normal . we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what is normal , . you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , things like that , and our market was going to be young , business , range . , so shall we start with the first presentation ?
marketing executive : shall i ?
project manager : yes if you feel
marketing executive : we just connect up . so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . the methods we used to decide on current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with a hundred subjects and the general feedback from them is that the most i m w i am slightly tongue - tied after lunch ,
project manager : it is .
marketing executive : project manager . we decided on the most important aspect i required in a remote control device and we will come to that later . so that was one of the first things we did . also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan . so the general findings from that was in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the current functional look and feel of remote controls . they also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . now i should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it is third in order of preference for the subject group we looked at . , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , we found from our consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? there also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , again in contrast to last year . so a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan . be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
project manager : very much . let is start from the inside and work our way out .
user interface designer : fine . it is with me .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : unless anyone has any questions about that ?
project manager : i do not , not yet .
marketing executive : not yet ?
project manager : yes , .
industrial designer : that screwed in ?
project manager : i hate those little things especially if you do them on too tight and you ca not get the leverage on them to undo them .
marketing executive : i know .
industrial designer : this is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . , first the into the method . the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the t_v _ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . also in this study i have looked into the availability of some of the materials , some of the things that we looked at last time are not un unfortunately are not available . , findings , i have got my little picture there . this is the chip called the t_a _ double one eight three five which is what is used in every remote control it sends out standard signals , based on your input and it is used for all t_v _ remotes at the moment . and then we are loo looking into battery options . there is actually no rechargeable option available , so we i saw the standard double a _ and triple a _ which we thought were a bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , that might be a bit silly to be honest ,
project manager : wa can you explain that ?
industrial designer : people wo not it is like wind - up radio .
project manager : like a right , .
industrial designer : so you wind up your remote control before you use it .
project manager : how what how l long can you get out of that ,
industrial designer : it might
project manager : can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that is it for the night ? or
industrial designer : you , i presu you would not have to wind it for very long , but i do not think it is really necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the solar charging , most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when you got t_v _ .
project manager : that does not count though does it ?
marketing executive : does does light charge as sunlight does ?
project manager : it was u_v _ like
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : artificial light ?
industrial designer : is it ? alright i
project manager : any , any
marketing executive : has to be solar .
user interface designer : regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple a _ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space .
industrial designer : it would the d the dynamo would take more space you actually need a physical handle to wind up .
project manager : i am pretty that solar is from the sun . , i do not think it counts electric lights
marketing executive : artificial light , no .
project manager : no , but not many you do not want to limit your market .
marketing executive : that is going to
project manager : people who live in basement flats there is not that many people , but there are people .
marketing executive : i know ,
industrial designer : but
marketing executive : different parts of the world too , if we are marketing internationally .
user interface designer : right .
industrial designer : and most people also watch t_v _ in the night anyway .
user interface designer : night .
project manager : but then it would be charging through the day , that it charges through the day and then you have got it charged for the evening .
industrial designer : but the next one is the best anyway . the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches
project manager : i have seen
industrial designer : and you d you do not even notice it . the amount of probably moving around you would be doing all the time would charge it up , i do not think you would ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .
user interface designer : and are these like what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ?
industrial designer : it is it charges into some form of it is a smaller cell which it charges into and the si the size a watch battery , they use them quite frequently in watches . and that will that would l would last for i do i d i am not entirely how long it would last but i have never seen one run out .
user interface designer : we c
project manager : but then if you think about a watch , it is on your wrist so it is on your whole bod it is on your body the whole time so you are walking around , you are doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . if you would
industrial designer : and
project manager : you switch the t_v _ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side .
industrial designer : but then again
project manager : is it really gonna be enough ?
industrial designer : it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it is only a tiny amount it is always moving for the whole day and they do not run out over night when you leave them on the side . and th for the same reason , you are only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you are finished with it
project manager : so it is not the draw on it is not
industrial designer : and you put it no i do i do not think the draw on it would be
marketing executive :  . could ask referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with standard batteries ? , could people put standard batteries in but with a s they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging
industrial designer : ye i th g y you could have a dual power thing
marketing executive : or the two things not compatible ?
project manager : like a dual .
industrial designer : but the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they are qui they are quite big and they all look i identical .
marketing executive : so that affects the exterior design .
user interface designer : solar would be slightly expensives .
project manager : expensive as . what price are we looking at for
industrial designer : they are they are expensive , they do not
user interface designer : it is twelve point f
project manager : i presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?
industrial designer : the normal batteries would be the cheapest i would presume then it would actually be the solar charging ones , but the it is i they are not very resistant to dropping ,
project manager : solar .
industrial designer : if you drop if you have y
project manager : they are not designed
industrial designer : the size you would need to charge a remote would not be that big but if remotes always get thrown around and , so .
project manager : practical - wise .
industrial designer : y , practically . calculators you do not really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do ,
project manager : you do get a bit of wear
industrial designer : they can t
project manager : but do not calculators have a battery in them as ?
industrial designer : they do , they they have got dual things , but they are the batteries are smaller .
user interface designer : another question is like
marketing executive : again it de
user interface designer : w w which one would last the longest , because we do not want customers to be like charging like a mobile phone every day . a remote control , like ,
industrial designer : w m
user interface designer : so we have to s look at the life also .
industrial designer : so the s if you had something du using the standard batteries and the solar charging , i do not think you would the it would d how long the standard double a_s would last in or triple a_s would last .
marketing executive : it would just detract from the attractiveness of the whole feature ,
industrial designer : i it would , .
marketing executive : i it is not gonna add anything , .
project manager : can we add in an attachment to closing feature ? can we think about that ? if we are doing the kinetic thing and it is
marketing executive : should not we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i personally
project manager : add it in to think about
marketing executive : right , .
project manager : because , where am i ? if it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people do not do we are doing something original and different but if you wore it if it is something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you would not lose it so much . but then maybe that is looking at someone who is just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of the controls .
marketing executive : it is not something that is come up in any of our focus groups and market research ,
project manager : no .
marketing executive : it is not a thing that people are looking for
user interface designer : so
marketing executive : when we threw it open to the field . but it is something to put on the side to think about maybe .
project manager : right .
industrial designer : i will move on .
project manager :  .
industrial designer : my second part of my findings the mo most current remotes use this silicone p_c_b _ board which pr printed circuit board , which has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it will connect the circuit and each switch is connected to two different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it is fired out of this l_e_d _ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .
project manager : what things do we have to consider there ? can we what size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of
industrial designer : this the thi the thing about is they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can print circuit board like that it is simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . if you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , if you wanted to there is an option to do it like that , or you could have some array of switches which i will speak about in the next bit so that and then to , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . now what i was thinking about that was sometimes when y when you have these things , they have got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a t_v _ remote , but you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds of not being used i would have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . , the case material , i have a been sent what the factory can actually give us , there is the plastic which we were gonna go for anyway as the main case housing the main problems with the you could go for wood but it would be a bit impractical . titanium very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , and rubber , you are saying that people like this spongy feel this year , so perhaps some something made of rubber , but i was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they have said that they have put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it is meant to be anti r_s_i _ . i am no i am not how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that is what they said . the problem with the casing is that there is quite a few design restrictions that they have got on the shape of the case . if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can be a little more they can do curved shapes . but whether or not because we would have it in two separate units
user interface designer : second thing is
project manager : hinged , .
industrial designer : for the flip phone .
user interface designer : and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . so in this case if you are looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red like that . so is that feature available in like titanium ,
industrial designer : i th
user interface designer : or it is like only specific to plastic or
industrial designer : in titanium i do not think it would be available really , the ju just it w you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is it is light and strong but it should be left for aircraft design rather than for a remote .
marketing executive : it does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . i have got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over ,
industrial designer : rubber , .
marketing executive : that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to have different fasciae for the phone .
industrial designer : and you can peel them off .
project manager : so instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber ,
marketing executive : like a rubber sleeve almost , .
user interface designer : something like
project manager : like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can pull that off .
user interface designer : alright . that could be a good idea . it could it would be comfortable to hold on also .
industrial designer : t
marketing executive : very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .
project manager : that is been really popular with mobile phones so i do not see why not .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : also the just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , i kno we were planning to do some touch screen . now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p_c_b _ circuit board and i am you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option . the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but that an l_c_d _ type of screen one they are incredibly thin and do not take up much space , two they you can have them in a array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a set thing and you could have them like a touch
user interface designer : i did not get the last part , you are talking of
industrial designer : display . what
user interface designer : just what you said i did not get the meaning of it completely , you are saying like
industrial designer : on the l_c_d _ screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it is that it is flat and so you ca not do lots of curve curved things with it , but you can you would not have with the l_c_d _ you would have the wires coming off , you would not have that with the l_c_d _ , you would only have that with the printed circuit board . with w also with the
marketing executive : i do not s to interrupt , i do not see why the curved thing is a problem , if we had a shell , once we open that
project manager : it would be flat inside .
industrial designer : you could have a flat screen inside ,
marketing executive : so it would be f , .
industrial designer : but i am just wondering whether we want an l_c_d _ screen inside .
marketing executive : have i misunderstood you ?
industrial designer : it would not be like full colour , it would just be black and white , but there would be touch buttons , so you would not be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti - r_s_i _ .
project manager : it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .
industrial designer : is rubber .
project manager : now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press ,
industrial designer : i had not really thought of that to be honest .
marketing executive : had another idea , i if it helps with that , but just to do with the r_s_i _ . is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to .
industrial designer : you could , you could have some stylus that you could pull out
project manager : like one of the palm pop thing .
industrial designer : but they could get a bit easily lost ,
user interface designer : f for somebody who very often , if he would
industrial designer : i had
project manager : it would have to be attached .
marketing executive : they are easy to replace as , cheap .
user interface designer : a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch - pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .
marketing executive : just a thought they would not actually need one and they could use anything they have got , could not they ? a pencil or a pen , so they would not really need a
project manager : we will talk about that so if you finish your
industrial designer : that is
project manager : and we will come back to that .
industrial designer : that is the end of m my
project manager : that is you , right .
user interface designer : and just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip - top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like .
industrial designer : that would be fairly simple , you would actually have two separate you would have two separate circuit boards but they would be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , in the actual flip bit you would have some linking .
marketing executive : i will just raise another point while it occurs to me , it applies to both our designers here , so i am not how it would fit in . if we flip open , now how you have got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ? and they respond to the turn of your body . is it possible that when we open our flip - top shell it is a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th the remote control display thing .
project manager : we are marketing to guys as much as we are to women .
marketing executive : they do not look at themselves ? just a thought .
project manager : it is a remote control , you were sitting watching t_v _ are you gonna want to open it and say shit i should go and have a shower and do my hair before i put the t _
marketing executive : i you mean , it is with us using the ideas for a mobile ph it is with us using the ideas for mobile phones i kinda got sidetracked onto that , .
project manager : no .
marketing executive : trying to think of other features we can build in that would not cost too much but maybe we will leave that one on the side .
industrial designer : you can you could do it , you could have a if you just put the full charge through an l_c_d _ display it will completely blank it out , but i if you could get any mirror effect on it , i am not about
marketing executive : forget about the mirror
project manager : .
marketing executive : that was just a very quick passing thought .
user interface designer : would like to share something which i did here . first thing is on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . so y you generally see there is not much of variety and like marketing team said , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . so you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous designs here . and second thing is there is too much of confusion here . no particular remote is standard . like , some people have a here you see this ? this is on a i found th that only common feature is the ch channel control and volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all . , and second as already discussed with william , we are going to have m maybe a g _ g_u_i _ interface in the f in the middle of the flip - top and g graphic user interface
marketing executive : what does that stand for ?
project manager : which means
user interface designer : which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , which is
industrial designer : if you if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer : like you have on a l icons y you have is a good example of g_u_i _ graphic user interface . so not point or click press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . and on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer . so we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .
project manager : can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? if you are thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone .
marketing executive : no you would hold it you do not if you flip it open then you would be would not you ? is not that the idea ? you us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you have got your l_c_d _ display there and you have got the buttons there so you are holding it in the palm of your hand , .
project manager : that is what i was just saying ,
industrial designer : but you can do it with your thumb li
user interface designer : but
project manager : and then have the l_c_d _ at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls ,
user interface designer : and you mean to the
project manager : so have the volume and the programme , things like that ,
user interface designer : and the lower distance .
project manager : on the lower side .
user interface designer : f perfect . so the findings are too many cluttered buttons . repetition of certain but buttons which i already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . all are confusing and in inconsistent . we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . we have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , but for like we had g s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . so it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers i am here . some thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also ? and technologically innovative also . so we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . my personal preferences would be like , as already marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so i would not say the design should be like a fruit , but we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , red chilli tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like , i if you see the previous slide
industrial designer : we
user interface designer : most of the users would now be acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls .
project manager : i ca not see that , is that play and stop and things ?
user interface designer : this is central one , the one you
project manager : or is that volume and channel ?
user interface designer : volume and channel . so keep that m that standardised because that is the most common feature across all models , if you look the models , it is here . this and voice recognition .
project manager : right . i am not how long we have got left , but we need to make a decision about the things we have discussed . so , we agree on do we agree on the battery ?
user interface designer : the kinetic .
marketing executive : kinetic ?
project manager : that means that there is no function for li the port , that it sits in , then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . it is a bi i it is like a g it is a gadget , it is a
industrial designer : if it is qui it is quite a feature to have
project manager : selling point .
industrial designer : and also if they have got it if they have got these parts already in stock , then it wo not be cheap to re - manufacture them , or it will be cheap to re - manufacture them . so do you reckon that is a good idea that , where is the remote , i am here thing ? that would be quite fun .
project manager : the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it is going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , but we have used cheap relatively cheap and simple things . the l_c_d _ is not cheap .
industrial designer : to s th it is not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour if we have just got a black and white one , they use them in calculators so .
user interface designer : maybe we could start with the black and white . that that way we could upgrade later .
project manager : and you could
marketing executive : we talked about kinetic charging , we have deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double a _ or triple a _ batteries ?
industrial designer : you cou .
project manager : do you want like a back - up ?
marketing executive : no , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double a _ or triple a _ batteries they have still got to be charged this way have not they ?
industrial designer : k no the kinetic ones come with a w watch a battery that goes in a watch .
marketing executive : i see . right , got you .
industrial designer : so it is a lot smaller , so it would
marketing executive : got you on that , did not realise .
project manager : so we have got battery . the inside components is pretty standardised across the board is not it ? so there is not a really a decision to be made there , . the buttons what did you give us as our the bare - board l_c_d _ or
industrial designer : the were we are going for the l_c_d _ on that one , on the buttons , on the top one we are gonna
project manager : on the top one you have got the touch and then
industrial designer : on the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti - r_s_i _ ones .
marketing executive : could you repeat that last part ?
industrial designer : on we have got the flip - screen , the top one is gonna be the l_c_d _ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons .
marketing executive : l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer : and for the
project manager : no , it is fine .
user interface designer : for the body design plastic , w
industrial designer : plastic ,
user interface designer : we could use the body ,
project manager : for the inside .
user interface designer : for the inside and rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design .
marketing executive :  , so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs ,
user interface designer : plast right .
project manager : so , so .
marketing executive : and it is just although it is rubberised and spongy , apart from that we are just going to go for vegetable and fruit colours , we are not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed ,
industrial designer : no .
project manager : no i
marketing executive : just go for the colours .
user interface designer : it is
project manager : we do not wanna be tacky if we have got a different shape anyway the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it psychedelic , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , but that is not really what we are focusing on , what we are focusing on is the m
marketing executive : the feel .
project manager : yes . so we could just pick anything .
marketing executive : is that going to be this image i have got in my head of something shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that is spongy . is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research ,
user interface designer : i it is different .
project manager : it is just different
marketing executive : is that fancy ?
project manager : it is just different from everything else and , i am trying to imagine clean looking houses , beige and black so you either want something that goes with that , which is what is on the market anyway , or you want something that contrasts as like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they are so interesting and
marketing executive : i am just pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but i agree . we looked at those remotes , they are anonymous , very similar looking things . this would definitely be different enough , wondered if anybody could come up with something even more
project manager : and you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little
marketing executive : the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year is time we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming it is so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on ,
project manager : and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes
marketing executive : which is another beauty of it .
project manager : y , you could just go so far with it ,
industrial designer : you can you can just
user interface designer : acupressure , you could talk of acupressures .
project manager : like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever , so that is quite a flexible thing .
user interface designer : and finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside ,
project manager : yes .
user interface designer : it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time .
industrial designer : j with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .
user interface designer : .
project manager : we have got five minutes , or that might have been up for a while .
user interface designer : fine .
marketing executive : so can recap sarah , for the decisions that we have made , kinetic charging , the watch - type batteries , l_c_d _ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we are gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . that is how far we have got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ?
user interface designer : fine , we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it remote control if it is lost . so , are we looking at voice ?
marketing executive : yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it is a good idea we just need to check on the cost ,
user interface designer : or maybe like william was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains .
marketing executive : is that right ?
user interface designer : for l , the whistle .
industrial designer : the whistle ones , .
user interface designer : so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle .
marketing executive : and incorporating the company logo ?
project manager : have you
user interface designer : i did not mention this , but we will be incorporating in the design .
marketing executive : i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y your report , it is not just a case of having a little r_r _ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it is our product
project manager : they do ,
marketing executive : do not they ?
project manager : but we can you could
marketing executive : since it is the only one of its kind on the market it is gonna be ours .
project manager : it is , you just address that with advertising . , you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you . it will have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . that it is got to stand out somehow differently but it does , without that so i am not worried about that .
marketing executive : did we i know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?
project manager : depending on how i
industrial designer : depending on the expense of it .
project manager : we have got this memo saying that it is something that the company is looking into , so
industrial designer : and they have got in stock , so .
project manager : that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it is hugely expensive we would have to cut down somewhere else , then it is worth thinking about . but we will find out more about cost afterwards . right i am going to wrap it up there . i got a end meeting now message on my mo
industrial designer : did it ?
project manager : so .
user interface designer : again a questionnaire ?
project manager : so we have probably got it says , closing we have forty minutes
marketing executive : you got to go through .
project manager : so we have probably got about that time before we come back . it is either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and how long that took .
user interface designer : we are pretty going in a clear direction now .
project manager : is everyone happy ?","the project manager reviewed the decisions from the previous meeting . the marketing expert made a presentation on trend watching , including trends in user requirements and trends in fashion . the industrial designer presented all the components of the device and announced that several of the features already discussed would not be available . he suggested substituting a kinetic battery for the rechargeable batteries and using a combination of rubber and plastic for the materials . the user interface designer presented his main interface design , which included buttons for the most frequently used features and a graphic user interface on the lcd screen for other functions , to keep frequently used features easy to use . he announced that speech recognition was still an option to consider , depending on price . the project manager then began a discussion to decide what was going into the final design . it was decided that a kinetic battery would be used in place of a rechargeable battery , that the remote will feature an lcd screen and rubber casing and rubber buttons , and that interchangeable rubber covers in fruit colors will be available . speech recognition may be included if it is not too costly . it was decided that the remote would feature an lcd screen , rubber buttons , colorful rubber changeable skins , a kinetic battery , and possibly speech recognition if it is still within the budget to include it . several of the features that the group had wanted to integrate into the design were either too costly or unavailable due to new limitations from the factory . the group had to change many of the original design elements to an alternative .
","the project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and briefed the team on some new requirements to consider when designing the remote . the marketing expert presented requirements of users as found in trend watching reports and discussed the results of a company market study which indicated a desire for a fancier look and feel , technological innovation , and a user-friendly interface . the user interface designer presented existing remotes on the market and discussed what features in terms of appearance and usability the team should include in their design . the industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the team discussed options for energy sources , materials , and chips . the team then discussed features to include in the remote such as voice recognition , an lcd screen , and interchangeable faceplates . the interface designer will work on the interface design the team will not work with teletext . the remote will use rechargeable batteries . the case will be made of plastic with rubber grips . a locator function will also be incorporated into the design , which will allow the user to access the remote when not in use . an extra button will be included for power , volume , channel selection , and speech recognition . the production costs cannot exceed 12.50 euro . the project will consult with the legal department to discuss the prevention of lawsuits from consumers claiming the remote caused rsi the cost of adding speech recognition to a remote will increase if the remote is used",x,x,,,,,,,7.0,BART-Baseline
78,"project manager : if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time .
marketing executive : is that someone is ?
project manager : is that .
user interface designer : .
project manager : you all switched on .
user interface designer : me too .
project manager : i presume we are good to go . minutes we decided to use a kinetic charger ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : standard chip , it can come in various different sizes , it was not gonna be a problem factor . we wanted a stand - by function . the case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . buttons with a combination of l_c_d _ and rubber according to the design . bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip feel . and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . and the rubber buttons that we will use will be anti - r_s_i _ . prototype presentation .
industrial designer : is that for us ?
project manager : that would be you .
user interface designer : me and william worked on a prototype , and william is going to make a p presentation on that .
industrial designer : shall i show ? though do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it
user interface designer : hold it like
project manager : make the camera is
user interface designer :
industrial designer : and i will show you the presentation .
user interface designer : so
industrial designer : can nick your
project manager : yes , yes you can . a second , i will get it out .
industrial designer : whoa .
user interface designer : it looks
industrial designer : going a bit crazy over here .
user interface designer : crazy .
project manager : you should have one of those things and you can just take it off .
user interface designer : where are the hinges ?
industrial designer : so
project manager : right .
industrial designer : this is our look and feel presentation , the final our final presentation . and we will first look at the exterior of what we have come up with over there .
user interface designer : you able to look ?
industrial designer : it is gonna have a plastic body with a standard colour , either we are thinking some something fairly neutral like a white or a light blue . this is underneath the rubberised outer casing
project manager :  .
industrial designer : which there would be a wide choice they would be attached , but we can come up with that . the wide choice of colours and patterns , so you have got a lot of customisation with it . it is an a clam - shell design and the top l_c_d _ screen that you can see that would b would be how do you say , it is , it would be inset into the top
user interface designer : the black and white touch screen wherein people can
project manager : . so it is flush .
industrial designer : and the buttons at the bottom would d
user interface designer : right .
industrial designer : so it will fully close flat .
project manager : right , .
industrial designer : and working on the inside we have already said d decided on the kinetic batteries , which actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as , so that you could probably get a bit of
project manager : so put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections ,
industrial designer : .
project manager : it is the top part that is
industrial designer : we decided that the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were coming in and they were fairly easy to get a - hold of , so we presumed that they would also be quite cheap . so you would have something like where you would shout out , where is the remote and it will shout back , i am here , . and then it wo it wo not shout out i am here . it will just shout out i am here , to similar effect .
project manager : i am under the sofa .
user interface designer : oka
project manager : or , that would be too complicated .
industrial designer : if it was going like i d tha that could be something for next time , maybe . you can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . the standard , there is be a standard transmission with the t_v _ using all the standard chips that we have talked about .
project manager : infrared .
industrial designer : it would have it is split over two different layers , it would need two separate p_c_b_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some cabling . and because , all t_v_s use this , the same infrared medium , we would just be using the same thing to transmit the data . and the infrared sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the we have not i do not think we actually put it on .
project manager : like here .
industrial designer : something like that .
user interface designer : infrared could be here also .
project manager : actually , no , it would be it would have to be on the front .
industrial designer : on the front side of that , .
user interface designer : . so when it is even if it is open here , the signals would go .
project manager : right , , i have got you . it is still pointing ,
industrial designer : so when you have actually got it open , it would be facing the t_v _ .
project manager : yes . , that would make sense .
industrial designer : and then finally on to the interface . the top screen , as we said , is would be an inset black and white l_c_d _ s touch screen
user interface designer : this one right here .
industrial designer : which would have all of the available functions for the remote on it , whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and things to that effect . and now we have we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have some bezzled logo on it , inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top .
user interface designer : which is
project manager : but not interfering with the outside look of the product
industrial designer : no d not actually . no , not interfering with l the whole look of the product when it is on the thing .
user interface designer : no .
project manager : once it is
user interface designer : look up to it .
industrial designer : and finally that is how we put the fashion back into electronics ,
project manager : very much .
industrial designer : as that is that is the company logo .
user interface designer : yay .
project manager : wrapping it all up ,
marketing executive : done .
project manager : i have now got evaluation criteria .
marketing executive : certainly .
user interface designer : so this is the one .
project manager : it is to be presented .
industrial designer : there you go .
marketing executive : logged in ?
user interface designer : evaluation .
project manager : it is quite similar to what it was before , though .
marketing executive : this stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the criteria that we got from our market research . so this is the first stage of the evaluation . now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . so it is what we have discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . the criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . the design should minimise r_s_i _ and be easy to locate and we were still slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . , so we can come back to that slide , if you do not have a note of those . i will just show you how we are going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . we are going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . we look at each of those criteria that i have just mentioned , i will call that slide back up , and i will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . does that seem clear ? any questions there ?
user interface designer : it is perfect .
marketing executive : we are going to look at these crite so
user interface designer : is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the market
marketing executive : yes , we are going to come to w we will discuss each one and we will come to a consensus rating between one and seven . one is true , seven is false . so i wo not write all of that out again . it will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or a _ , b _ , c _ , d _ , e _ , f _ to confuse it with the number rating . b _ , c _ , d _ , e _ , f _ . this is where i realise how tiny i actually am .
project manager : just write small .
marketing executive : criteria and rating . actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . how about that ?
user interface designer : so you can
project manager : .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : so i will just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who is who . criteria a _ , the fancy look and feel . how do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel . my own rating for that would be a two . one is true
project manager : i would agree .
industrial designer : i would probably put it two ,
marketing executive : i will just go this way .
industrial designer : two or three .
marketing executive : two .
industrial designer : no , three .
project manager : i would say two .
user interface designer : i would say four .
marketing executive : a four , . adding those up , we have got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ? two and three quarters , it that right .
user interface designer : almost three .
marketing executive : two and three quarters ? two point seven five , there we go . , criteria b _ , criterion b _ , technologically innovative . i would give that a three .
industrial designer : i would give it a one .
marketing executive : not that you are biased in that it the designer .
industrial designer : no , no , not .
project manager : a two .
user interface designer : i got it wrong . the first one rating , i am . can you just make it two ?
marketing executive : the average
user interface designer : it the other way .
marketing executive : for you ? you want your rating to be a two ? is that what you are saying ?
user interface designer : in got
marketing executive : so , i will work out the average for that again at the end . it is a very slightly altered
user interface designer : two point f
marketing executive : and we are just waiting for your rating
project manager : it is just two point five for that one .
marketing executive : f two point five , . losing one decimal place , that is .
user interface designer : one is a , seven is false ,
marketing executive : so what are you rating for this one , paw ?
user interface designer : two .
marketing executive : two , . so that is eight . that brings it down to two ,
industrial designer : two .
marketing executive : and simple , ease of use . based on what you have said there , i would say a one , true .
project manager : i would say a two .
marketing executive : a two , . i should have said a two to make the arithmetic easy , should not i ? we will just put almost two ,
project manager : one point seven f five .
marketing executive : because i am not gonna get into silly decimal places .
project manager :  .
marketing executive : or we or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . now we are looking at
industrial designer : d _ .
marketing executive : it incorporates current fashion trends , now that is particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours .
industrial designer : one .
marketing executive : i am just thinking , before i give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here .
industrial designer : that is
marketing executive : is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ?
industrial designer : no , no , the base colour was white or like or l a light blue ,
user interface designer : white . with for the plastic ?
industrial designer : but the changeable fa faces would allow you to get any one of a number of colours that th it is full customised .
marketing executive : right .
user interface designer : any
marketing executive : so we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that is what we are intending to do .
industrial designer : and
marketing executive : and the spongy feel is no problem with that .
user interface designer : because you will be having a because of the rubber case .
industrial designer : th that is the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that otherwise it is just hard plastic .
marketing executive : in that case it is got to be a one for me .
industrial designer : i will give it a one as .
project manager : one .
marketing executive : everybody ?
user interface designer : one .
marketing executive : that part was and easy . moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . i do not think we have really touched on that a lot .
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : we have we have discussed it , we have not really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . we have talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you are someone who is zapping , who is sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ?
project manager : the type of button that we are gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises r_s_i _
industrial designer : it is meant to be .
marketing executive :  .
project manager : it is meant to . maybe because it is slightl with the size that we have got it is quite small , but with the amount of we are putting on it is not that much . so maybe because there is more space , it is not moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between . it is quite obvious just big buttons .
marketing executive : i am gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four .
industrial designer : i would f i would go for a five , actually ,
marketing executive : a five , .
project manager : four .
marketing executive : four and a four .
user interface designer : four .
marketing executive : twenty one is that twenty one ? so that is four point two five . and finally , last but not least , easy to locate . now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ?
industrial designer : it was a voice recognition ,
user interface designer : voice r recognition .
marketing executive : it was the i am here thing , and are we happy with the costs on that ? that is going to be feasible , cost - wise .
industrial designer : that , that is feasible .
marketing executive : that sounds good then . i would go for a i ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on t_v _ . so if sombody is in the other room or if t_v_s in different rooms , or .
industrial designer : it would r it would probably be a stand it would be a stand
project manager : a standard .
industrial designer : it would be quite loud .
project manager : it would be .
marketing executive : right .
industrial designer : so it would be s p
marketing executive : you built into the feature .
project manager : and if you did not hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you would realise that it was not in that room , you would go into another room .
marketing executive : logical . that is a one for me .
industrial designer : one .
marketing executive : one and one , good .
industrial designer : i do realise that we might be being fairly biased , it is our product , but
marketing executive : how do we feel about this ? we have got our we have got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the six criteria there . that is for incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . the lowest rating we have got , which is really n it is not terribly low , i it is close around neutral is for the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ?
project manager : i do not .
industrial designer : w i thin
marketing executive : we happy to go ahead ?
project manager : we .
marketing executive : for most of those ratings that it is high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and i really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that .
project manager : do much apart from having a huge big
marketing executive : i know . , i hope that is clear to the team . is there anything you would like to ask me about the findings before i sum up ?
project manager : do not .
marketing executive : good . i will just leave it there .
project manager : i have got finance here now . i am gonna plug this in so you can all see it , if that is .
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : you want me to b unplug that ?
project manager : now i presume that the screen will go blank , that we just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value . so are we still on for kinetic ?
marketing executive : yes .
project manager : see , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . it might have influenced our choice . right , what is happening with the electronics ?
industrial designer : it was a regular chip on print
user interface designer : chip on print .
project manager : double - curved .
industrial designer : no , the it is you have put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one . in the top , it is the number
project manager : right ,
industrial designer : of c .
project manager : so , would there be two ?
industrial designer : just a no , one reg v
project manager : one chip .
industrial designer : one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker . and they are double curved .
user interface designer : single - curved .
project manager : one double curve .
industrial designer : y two ,
user interface designer : two curves , .
industrial designer : it is two .
marketing executive : but it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit . so it can rest .
project manager : so what is a single curve then ?
industrial designer : i would say it was w
marketing executive : it would just be a flat bottom with one curve . like a domed thing .
user interface designer : single - cu
project manager : just one double
industrial designer : one double - curved . and one
user interface designer : plastic and rubber .
industrial designer : one , one is double - curved , and then the other one is
marketing executive : the other curves at the sides , but it is slightly flattened at the bottom so it does not roll over .
project manager : we have got plastic and rubber ,
industrial designer : a plastic .
project manager : have not we ?
user interface designer : plastic one and maybe rubber point five .
industrial designer : and special colour .
user interface designer : no rubber , since it is being used just as a casing , we can put point five .
project manager : do you think ?
user interface designer : it allows the point five , we can use that .
marketing executive : what does it mean if you put point five for that ?
user interface designer : it means we are not using a lot of rubber actually . we are using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic .
project manager : it would be like saying we are using see , it says case material . we are not actually using plastic in the case , are we ?
industrial designer : that is it is as an extra .
project manager : it is including , it is including .
marketing executive : right , .
industrial designer : so that should not be actually on there , because that is not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get .
marketing executive : but it is gonna be part of the total cost , and there is nowhere else we can put that in , is there ? there is nowhere else we can code for the rubber used in the casing . so do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ?
project manager : we will just put it in as we will put in as half . or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway . no , we do not step on anyone is toes . special colour , do we need that ?
marketing executive : might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours .
project manager : n , .
user interface designer : push - button .
industrial designer : the push - button is one and l_c _ display one .
user interface designer : an one .
project manager : buttons
industrial designer : and buttons
marketing executive : s
user interface designer : we could change the battery also . instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery .
marketing executive : has that not made any d if you click off that square now , has that not made any difference ?
project manager : has that not gone up ?
industrial designer : yes .
marketing executive : is it it is brought it slightly down .
project manager : no , it was seven five it is changed not a lot .
marketing executive : is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , is that going to make a difference ?
user interface designer : uncurved , flat .
marketing executive : it is not made any difference , has it ?
user interface designer : no , it just surprises one .
industrial designer : we will have
marketing executive : it is gone up again .
project manager : it is not calculated it .
industrial designer : you have got to click off to calculate it again .
project manager : there we go .
marketing executive : it is brought it down slightly .
project manager : it is not a lot though .
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : c it might you might be assuming that is in euros . it could be in dollars . and then it would be fine , because the exchange range would make it about twelve .
project manager : we have not been dealin we have not been dealing with dollars though ,
marketing executive : is there anything on the menu no .
user interface designer : ri it is in euro .
project manager : so the highest we have got is the electronics here . and the interface .
marketing executive : if we tr . if we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ?
user interface designer : and going to a regular bat
industrial designer : the standard , it would make one difference . the biggest one would be taking away if you took away
user interface designer : what i feel is , customers never said anything about the battery .
industrial designer : if you to
user interface designer : it is internal , nobody looks into the battery . but shape and colours , that is something we should not comprimi
marketing executive : and people are used to buying batteries ,
industrial designer : if if you take away the voice ,
marketing executive : they are not gonna say i am not getting this , i have got to buy a battery for a remote control .
industrial designer : i do i do not like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you have got it .
user interface designer : where is that special form ?
marketing executive : should we see what difference it makes ?
project manager : where is the
industrial designer : i .
project manager : where is the voice recognition ?
industrial designer : no it is samples sens sample speaker .
project manager : right , .
industrial designer : if you took away that , that will make it twelve point three five .
project manager : the kinetic is three . if we change it to the battery it is that is minus three .
industrial designer : they n but you p minus three plus two .
project manager : right . i keep seeing zero . we can do it some other way , we can do it does not have to be voice recognition . we could do the voice recognition for , business class , like an upgraded version . you could choose to have that or not .
industrial designer : but they but in i do not see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product .
marketing executive : but we are still working to head o
project manager : so should we just change the design specification then ?
user interface designer : make it costly .
marketing executive : we can put in our recommendations . if we if we are working to head office specifications as this is what this project team is working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we have found and what we the consensus that we have come to as a result of the meetings .
project manager : yes .
industrial designer : we c we could s
marketing executive : but we need to work to that specification to start with .
industrial designer : we could say
marketing executive : and the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f in a first instance . as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers
project manager : we can make the price fit ,
industrial designer : i s
project manager : and then say if we would had our budget , we would have had this ,
industrial designer : and then say we recommend
project manager : because it also sets it apart from the crowd .
marketing executive : we have done all the background work to go for that if they want it .
project manager : they like their gadgets , they like something that is completely different . it is something completely different associated with your company . right , so
marketing executive : so if we take voice recognition out
industrial designer : that will do it . twelve point three five .
user interface designer : we are close to the budget .
marketing executive : we are .
industrial designer : is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ?
user interface designer : two five .
project manager : it is two point five . no , it is twelve point two five .
marketing executive : are you ? , not meaning to doubt your words there .
project manager : two , twelve point two five times two is twenty five ,
marketing executive : are they really going to quibble about ten p _ ? or point zero one of a euro ?
user interface designer : it is twelve point five maybe , then .
project manager : is not it ?
marketing executive : which is less than ten p _ .
user interface designer : i what it said fifty percent of the cost . so half of the price would be
project manager : the agenda one was where the price was , was not it ?
user interface designer : it is the first one .
marketing executive : that is today is kick off meeting , .
project manager : twelve point five .
marketing executive : . that is what it was .
user interface designer : so we are under the budget .
project manager : done , people .
marketing executive : so we are .
project manager : is that got us covered for the electronics then ? we do not need something else to take that place ?
industrial designer : that was just a bought - on extra , you could just take that out and that would be fine , .
user interface designer : seems fine .
industrial designer : that is brilliant .
user interface designer : except voice recognition , everything is
project manager : so we have done that . product evaluation . we have done room for creativity , because we have got decisions that we would have made that we were not did not feel able to make . i presume we discussed leadership and teamwork .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : in the sense that did you feel like a team ? or did you feel like autonomy ?
industrial designer : i would say , as a team .
user interface designer : we had a time .
marketing executive : although we had our separate tasks , there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to bounce off each other .
industrial designer : find out from each other ,
marketing executive : and i have certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we have been able to , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary .
user interface designer : there was very constructive feedback by everybody . it is not like people trying to cut each other . there is more of true cohesive teamwork . we came to a very predic creative design , . and sarah , you coordinated the work very .
project manager : how did you find it ?
industrial designer : no , it went really and i , i feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we did not quite make the voice recognition in there , but that is good . it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if we would seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , maybe it would have come out a d little different ,
project manager : i liked the fact that we could say an idea and it would be suggested that was not the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , y it did not matter it saying what you thought , because if it was not something that was that relevant , then it did not matter , it was just another idea in the field . you two created that wonderful specimen of a play - doh model .
user interface designer : that was the best part
project manager : i am still not caught up .
user interface designer : of the
project manager : but that is nothing to do with the teamwork .
marketing executive : maybe we should think of branching out into children is toys and fake mobile phones as a side line . and fake r_c_s .
project manager : maybe . that was quite fun . means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ?
industrial designer : discuss which ones
marketing executive : how do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ? could ithave been better , was it adequate ?
industrial designer : we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually had more time and if we would been separated more .
project manager : had time to we could just say , what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it , but it was having it there . like the whole picture of the thing .
user interface designer : moving around the room . but it is good , like we spent times individually . i never thought of a remote control with a flip top .
project manager : it is new ideas in general ,
marketing executive : it is really borrowing from other areas , it is , bringing things from other areas in ,
project manager : rather than
marketing executive : it so it is nothing is new , but it is applying it to a d in a different area .
industrial designer : vegetables .
user interface designer : that is mine .
project manager : no .
user interface designer : it is
project manager : they have to come from somewhere , do not they ?
marketing executive : .
project manager : and as sh as w
user interface designer :
project manager : you go .
user interface designer : go on sarah .
project manager : as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one is thought about it particularly . they are slightly different , so if someone is been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else is , it is w something we should think about , but no one is put any great deal of thought into it .
industrial designer : i do i do not think the companies are really concerned . they are just like we have got a d_v_d _ player , does anyone remember the remote control ? ca not you get the one that we used for the last one ? just jazz it up a bit . d they do not really think about it , because normally , the remote control is not the product which they are trying to ship . they are trying to ship the d_v_d _ player , the video player , the t_v _ .
marketing executive : the focus is not on to that , .
project manager : but then when it everything is really smart , and you have just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it does not go , if you could have something that is a proper funky thing , a funky item that is individual , individual to you , they could even go into you go in with an idea and they design it on photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic , you would pray you would pay a lot extra , because it is individually being a plastic was being made for you . but people could have anything that they wanted .
user interface designer : surprising to me is like people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch like that .
project manager : because of the produ
user interface designer : and new f television products coming up , but nobody giving much idea to this . like sarah was telling , everything is
marketing executive : it is really good that this has been very market research based , because just going back to mobile phones , this is the first change in remote control devices that really , say is obvious and visible . we see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that is where we have borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . there are innovations in that people do not really want . i see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they ca not get it anymore and it is innovation for innovation is sake , and it is wonderful our company is so r _ and d _ based .
project manager : it is innovation for money is sake . the the people have to keep buying .
marketing executive : but forcing it onto people , it is things that , they might want to buy the thing they really want .
project manager : and you ca not get you have got your handset that works fine , but you ca not get the battery anymore for that type of phone ,
marketing executive : .
project manager : because the phones have moved on , things like that .
marketing executive : or there is not a cover to fit it or whatever ,
project manager : it is madness .
marketing executive : see
project manager : in closing there we go . our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased , but i , d what do you think ? do you think that is takes into account overheads like us being paid a thing ? and the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ?
marketing executive : it was just the produc just the production cost of the phone .
industrial designer : that was just the physical .
project manager : so it looks like it is gonna be fifty percent profit , you have still got all of the overheads to come out of that . so maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it is sold at .
user interface designer : maybe fifty percent more .
project manager : but but you were saying that is quite
industrial designer : i do not from the market research .
marketing executive : but in the remit that we were given , it was very specific . we have done what we were required to do , and there will have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at those things . i do not think that is something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for .
industrial designer : it was
marketing executive : we have done very to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item that people are really gonna want .
project manager : it is a shame it wo not ever get made .
user interface designer : who knows ?
project manager : maybe it will .
marketing executive : maybe it will . maybe they are gonna steal our ideas
project manager : maybe someonewill r run down and patent it .
industrial designer : i it is top secret . it is it is it is a conspiracy going on here . that is what it is .
marketing executive : and sell it .
project manager : the project has been evaluated and truly . and we have got the meeting survey and questionnaire .
user interface designer : there is a final questionnaire .
project manager : so we have got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that i fell behind with ,
industrial designer : in your
project manager : so i will be delegating in my role as project supervisor , so good luck .
user interface designer : celebration , you did not talk about that .
project manager : the celebration is the twenty five pounds . either that or we will be dancing on the desks .
marketing executive : questionnaire .
industrial designer : is that it then ?
project manager : just the last , .
industrial designer : awesome .
project manager : i have got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy .
marketing executive : questionnaire done . i did not have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time .
industrial designer : was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you would done in your thing ?
marketing executive : right .
industrial designer : i do not think .
marketing executive : but do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too ?
industrial designer : the s , questionnaire seven was the one i did just before the meeting .","the project manager went over decisions from the previous meeting . the industrial designer presented the prototype and discussed its look , its internal components , and its interface . the marketing expert evaluated the product according to the initial product goals . the group then decided that enough of this criteria had been satisfied for the project to continue . the project manager presented the final cost of the device which exceeded the initial projected price point . the group decided to remove speech recognition but to propose to the management that it  remain in the design . the group then discussed their effectiveness as a team . all members felt that they interacted well and that they felt they could be creative . the marketing expert felt that the market-research based approach would help the project's success with consumers . the group did express , however , that the budget was overly constraining . the project manager instructed the group to fill out a final evaluation questionnaire . the group will suggest to the management that speech recognition remain in the product design . all members will fill out a final evaluation questionnaire . it was decided that the speech recognition component seemed feasible , so it was added to the prototype design to provide a device locator function . it was removed when the project exceeded its initial budget , but it will be suggested to the management that the speech recognition should remain in the product design . the plastic case will be a neutral color , and the changeable rubber cases will be available in vibrant , fruit colors . the lcd screen will appear only in black and white . the company logo will appear on the inside of the device when opened . the group decided that the device fulfilled enough of the project's initial goals to continue in production . there was a lack of cost information at the beginning of the project . the group did not know how much the features made available to them actually cost until the prototype was constructed; their prototype design may have been different had this information been available at the beginning .
","the and speech recognition . the designers presented three prototypes of the device to the group and discussed the options for components and the materials used in making the device . the group decided on using a clam-shell design , a locator function , and a battery that would be fairly easy to get hold of . the industrial designer presented what would be",x,,,x,,,,,4.0,BART-Baseline
79,"project manager : if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time .
marketing executive : is that someone is ?
project manager : is that .
user interface designer : .
project manager : you all switched on .
user interface designer : me too .
project manager : i presume we are good to go . minutes we decided to use a kinetic charger ,
user interface designer :  .
project manager : standard chip , it can come in various different sizes , it was not gonna be a problem factor . we wanted a stand - by function . the case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . buttons with a combination of l_c_d _ and rubber according to the design . bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip feel . and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . and the rubber buttons that we will use will be anti - r_s_i _ . prototype presentation .
industrial designer : is that for us ?
project manager : that would be you .
user interface designer : me and william worked on a prototype , and william is going to make a p presentation on that .
industrial designer : shall i show ? though do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it
user interface designer : hold it like
project manager : make the camera is
user interface designer :
industrial designer : and i will show you the presentation .
user interface designer : so
industrial designer : can nick your
project manager : yes , yes you can . a second , i will get it out .
industrial designer : whoa .
user interface designer : it looks
industrial designer : going a bit crazy over here .
user interface designer : crazy .
project manager : you should have one of those things and you can just take it off .
user interface designer : where are the hinges ?
industrial designer : so
project manager : right .
industrial designer : this is our look and feel presentation , the final our final presentation . and we will first look at the exterior of what we have come up with over there .
user interface designer : you able to look ?
industrial designer : it is gonna have a plastic body with a standard colour , either we are thinking some something fairly neutral like a white or a light blue . this is underneath the rubberised outer casing
project manager :  .
industrial designer : which there would be a wide choice they would be attached , but we can come up with that . the wide choice of colours and patterns , so you have got a lot of customisation with it . it is an a clam - shell design and the top l_c_d _ screen that you can see that would b would be how do you say , it is , it would be inset into the top
user interface designer : the black and white touch screen wherein people can
project manager : . so it is flush .
industrial designer : and the buttons at the bottom would d
user interface designer : right .
industrial designer : so it will fully close flat .
project manager : right , .
industrial designer : and working on the inside we have already said d decided on the kinetic batteries , which actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as , so that you could probably get a bit of
project manager : so put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections ,
industrial designer : .
project manager : it is the top part that is
industrial designer : we decided that the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were coming in and they were fairly easy to get a - hold of , so we presumed that they would also be quite cheap . so you would have something like where you would shout out , where is the remote and it will shout back , i am here , . and then it wo it wo not shout out i am here . it will just shout out i am here , to similar effect .
project manager : i am under the sofa .
user interface designer : oka
project manager : or , that would be too complicated .
industrial designer : if it was going like i d tha that could be something for next time , maybe . you can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . the standard , there is be a standard transmission with the t_v _ using all the standard chips that we have talked about .
project manager : infrared .
industrial designer : it would have it is split over two different layers , it would need two separate p_c_b_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some cabling . and because , all t_v_s use this , the same infrared medium , we would just be using the same thing to transmit the data . and the infrared sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the we have not i do not think we actually put it on .
project manager : like here .
industrial designer : something like that .
user interface designer : infrared could be here also .
project manager : actually , no , it would be it would have to be on the front .
industrial designer : on the front side of that , .
user interface designer : . so when it is even if it is open here , the signals would go .
project manager : right , , i have got you . it is still pointing ,
industrial designer : so when you have actually got it open , it would be facing the t_v _ .
project manager : yes . , that would make sense .
industrial designer : and then finally on to the interface . the top screen , as we said , is would be an inset black and white l_c_d _ s touch screen
user interface designer : this one right here .
industrial designer : which would have all of the available functions for the remote on it , whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and things to that effect . and now we have we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have some bezzled logo on it , inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top .
user interface designer : which is
project manager : but not interfering with the outside look of the product
industrial designer : no d not actually . no , not interfering with l the whole look of the product when it is on the thing .
user interface designer : no .
project manager : once it is
user interface designer : look up to it .
industrial designer : and finally that is how we put the fashion back into electronics ,
project manager : very much .
industrial designer : as that is that is the company logo .
user interface designer : yay .
project manager : wrapping it all up ,
marketing executive : done .
project manager : i have now got evaluation criteria .
marketing executive : certainly .
user interface designer : so this is the one .
project manager : it is to be presented .
industrial designer : there you go .
marketing executive : logged in ?
user interface designer : evaluation .
project manager : it is quite similar to what it was before , though .
marketing executive : this stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the criteria that we got from our market research . so this is the first stage of the evaluation . now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . so it is what we have discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . the criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . the design should minimise r_s_i _ and be easy to locate and we were still slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . , so we can come back to that slide , if you do not have a note of those . i will just show you how we are going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . we are going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . we look at each of those criteria that i have just mentioned , i will call that slide back up , and i will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . does that seem clear ? any questions there ?
user interface designer : it is perfect .
marketing executive : we are going to look at these crite so
user interface designer : is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the market
marketing executive : yes , we are going to come to w we will discuss each one and we will come to a consensus rating between one and seven . one is true , seven is false . so i wo not write all of that out again . it will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or a _ , b _ , c _ , d _ , e _ , f _ to confuse it with the number rating . b _ , c _ , d _ , e _ , f _ . this is where i realise how tiny i actually am .
project manager : just write small .
marketing executive : criteria and rating . actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . how about that ?
user interface designer : so you can
project manager : .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : so i will just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who is who . criteria a _ , the fancy look and feel . how do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel . my own rating for that would be a two . one is true
project manager : i would agree .
industrial designer : i would probably put it two ,
marketing executive : i will just go this way .
industrial designer : two or three .
marketing executive : two .
industrial designer : no , three .
project manager : i would say two .
user interface designer : i would say four .
marketing executive : a four , . adding those up , we have got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ? two and three quarters , it that right .
user interface designer : almost three .
marketing executive : two and three quarters ? two point seven five , there we go . , criteria b _ , criterion b _ , technologically innovative . i would give that a three .
industrial designer : i would give it a one .
marketing executive : not that you are biased in that it the designer .
industrial designer : no , no , not .
project manager : a two .
user interface designer : i got it wrong . the first one rating , i am . can you just make it two ?
marketing executive : the average
user interface designer : it the other way .
marketing executive : for you ? you want your rating to be a two ? is that what you are saying ?
user interface designer : in got
marketing executive : so , i will work out the average for that again at the end . it is a very slightly altered
user interface designer : two point f
marketing executive : and we are just waiting for your rating
project manager : it is just two point five for that one .
marketing executive : f two point five , . losing one decimal place , that is .
user interface designer : one is a , seven is false ,
marketing executive : so what are you rating for this one , paw ?
user interface designer : two .
marketing executive : two , . so that is eight . that brings it down to two ,
industrial designer : two .
marketing executive : and simple , ease of use . based on what you have said there , i would say a one , true .
project manager : i would say a two .
marketing executive : a two , . i should have said a two to make the arithmetic easy , should not i ? we will just put almost two ,
project manager : one point seven f five .
marketing executive : because i am not gonna get into silly decimal places .
project manager :  .
marketing executive : or we or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . now we are looking at
industrial designer : d _ .
marketing executive : it incorporates current fashion trends , now that is particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours .
industrial designer : one .
marketing executive : i am just thinking , before i give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here .
industrial designer : that is
marketing executive : is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ?
industrial designer : no , no , the base colour was white or like or l a light blue ,
user interface designer : white . with for the plastic ?
industrial designer : but the changeable fa faces would allow you to get any one of a number of colours that th it is full customised .
marketing executive : right .
user interface designer : any
marketing executive : so we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that is what we are intending to do .
industrial designer : and
marketing executive : and the spongy feel is no problem with that .
user interface designer : because you will be having a because of the rubber case .
industrial designer : th that is the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that otherwise it is just hard plastic .
marketing executive : in that case it is got to be a one for me .
industrial designer : i will give it a one as .
project manager : one .
marketing executive : everybody ?
user interface designer : one .
marketing executive : that part was and easy . moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . i do not think we have really touched on that a lot .
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : we have we have discussed it , we have not really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . we have talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you are someone who is zapping , who is sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ?
project manager : the type of button that we are gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises r_s_i _
industrial designer : it is meant to be .
marketing executive :  .
project manager : it is meant to . maybe because it is slightl with the size that we have got it is quite small , but with the amount of we are putting on it is not that much . so maybe because there is more space , it is not moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between . it is quite obvious just big buttons .
marketing executive : i am gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four .
industrial designer : i would f i would go for a five , actually ,
marketing executive : a five , .
project manager : four .
marketing executive : four and a four .
user interface designer : four .
marketing executive : twenty one is that twenty one ? so that is four point two five . and finally , last but not least , easy to locate . now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ?
industrial designer : it was a voice recognition ,
user interface designer : voice r recognition .
marketing executive : it was the i am here thing , and are we happy with the costs on that ? that is going to be feasible , cost - wise .
industrial designer : that , that is feasible .
marketing executive : that sounds good then . i would go for a i ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on t_v _ . so if sombody is in the other room or if t_v_s in different rooms , or .
industrial designer : it would r it would probably be a stand it would be a stand
project manager : a standard .
industrial designer : it would be quite loud .
project manager : it would be .
marketing executive : right .
industrial designer : so it would be s p
marketing executive : you built into the feature .
project manager : and if you did not hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you would realise that it was not in that room , you would go into another room .
marketing executive : logical . that is a one for me .
industrial designer : one .
marketing executive : one and one , good .
industrial designer : i do realise that we might be being fairly biased , it is our product , but
marketing executive : how do we feel about this ? we have got our we have got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the six criteria there . that is for incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . the lowest rating we have got , which is really n it is not terribly low , i it is close around neutral is for the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ?
project manager : i do not .
industrial designer : w i thin
marketing executive : we happy to go ahead ?
project manager : we .
marketing executive : for most of those ratings that it is high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and i really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that .
project manager : do much apart from having a huge big
marketing executive : i know . , i hope that is clear to the team . is there anything you would like to ask me about the findings before i sum up ?
project manager : do not .
marketing executive : good . i will just leave it there .
project manager : i have got finance here now . i am gonna plug this in so you can all see it , if that is .
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : you want me to b unplug that ?
project manager : now i presume that the screen will go blank , that we just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value . so are we still on for kinetic ?
marketing executive : yes .
project manager : see , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . it might have influenced our choice . right , what is happening with the electronics ?
industrial designer : it was a regular chip on print
user interface designer : chip on print .
project manager : double - curved .
industrial designer : no , the it is you have put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one . in the top , it is the number
project manager : right ,
industrial designer : of c .
project manager : so , would there be two ?
industrial designer : just a no , one reg v
project manager : one chip .
industrial designer : one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker . and they are double curved .
user interface designer : single - curved .
project manager : one double curve .
industrial designer : y two ,
user interface designer : two curves , .
industrial designer : it is two .
marketing executive : but it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit . so it can rest .
project manager : so what is a single curve then ?
industrial designer : i would say it was w
marketing executive : it would just be a flat bottom with one curve . like a domed thing .
user interface designer : single - cu
project manager : just one double
industrial designer : one double - curved . and one
user interface designer : plastic and rubber .
industrial designer : one , one is double - curved , and then the other one is
marketing executive : the other curves at the sides , but it is slightly flattened at the bottom so it does not roll over .
project manager : we have got plastic and rubber ,
industrial designer : a plastic .
project manager : have not we ?
user interface designer : plastic one and maybe rubber point five .
industrial designer : and special colour .
user interface designer : no rubber , since it is being used just as a casing , we can put point five .
project manager : do you think ?
user interface designer : it allows the point five , we can use that .
marketing executive : what does it mean if you put point five for that ?
user interface designer : it means we are not using a lot of rubber actually . we are using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic .
project manager : it would be like saying we are using see , it says case material . we are not actually using plastic in the case , are we ?
industrial designer : that is it is as an extra .
project manager : it is including , it is including .
marketing executive : right , .
industrial designer : so that should not be actually on there , because that is not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get .
marketing executive : but it is gonna be part of the total cost , and there is nowhere else we can put that in , is there ? there is nowhere else we can code for the rubber used in the casing . so do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ?
project manager : we will just put it in as we will put in as half . or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway . no , we do not step on anyone is toes . special colour , do we need that ?
marketing executive : might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours .
project manager : n , .
user interface designer : push - button .
industrial designer : the push - button is one and l_c _ display one .
user interface designer : an one .
project manager : buttons
industrial designer : and buttons
marketing executive : s
user interface designer : we could change the battery also . instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery .
marketing executive : has that not made any d if you click off that square now , has that not made any difference ?
project manager : has that not gone up ?
industrial designer : yes .
marketing executive : is it it is brought it slightly down .
project manager : no , it was seven five it is changed not a lot .
marketing executive : is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , is that going to make a difference ?
user interface designer : uncurved , flat .
marketing executive : it is not made any difference , has it ?
user interface designer : no , it just surprises one .
industrial designer : we will have
marketing executive : it is gone up again .
project manager : it is not calculated it .
industrial designer : you have got to click off to calculate it again .
project manager : there we go .
marketing executive : it is brought it down slightly .
project manager : it is not a lot though .
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : c it might you might be assuming that is in euros . it could be in dollars . and then it would be fine , because the exchange range would make it about twelve .
project manager : we have not been dealin we have not been dealing with dollars though ,
marketing executive : is there anything on the menu no .
user interface designer : ri it is in euro .
project manager : so the highest we have got is the electronics here . and the interface .
marketing executive : if we tr . if we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ?
user interface designer : and going to a regular bat
industrial designer : the standard , it would make one difference . the biggest one would be taking away if you took away
user interface designer : what i feel is , customers never said anything about the battery .
industrial designer : if you to
user interface designer : it is internal , nobody looks into the battery . but shape and colours , that is something we should not comprimi
marketing executive : and people are used to buying batteries ,
industrial designer : if if you take away the voice ,
marketing executive : they are not gonna say i am not getting this , i have got to buy a battery for a remote control .
industrial designer : i do i do not like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you have got it .
user interface designer : where is that special form ?
marketing executive : should we see what difference it makes ?
project manager : where is the
industrial designer : i .
project manager : where is the voice recognition ?
industrial designer : no it is samples sens sample speaker .
project manager : right , .
industrial designer : if you took away that , that will make it twelve point three five .
project manager : the kinetic is three . if we change it to the battery it is that is minus three .
industrial designer : they n but you p minus three plus two .
project manager : right . i keep seeing zero . we can do it some other way , we can do it does not have to be voice recognition . we could do the voice recognition for , business class , like an upgraded version . you could choose to have that or not .
industrial designer : but they but in i do not see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product .
marketing executive : but we are still working to head o
project manager : so should we just change the design specification then ?
user interface designer : make it costly .
marketing executive : we can put in our recommendations . if we if we are working to head office specifications as this is what this project team is working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we have found and what we the consensus that we have come to as a result of the meetings .
project manager : yes .
industrial designer : we c we could s
marketing executive : but we need to work to that specification to start with .
industrial designer : we could say
marketing executive : and the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f in a first instance . as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers
project manager : we can make the price fit ,
industrial designer : i s
project manager : and then say if we would had our budget , we would have had this ,
industrial designer : and then say we recommend
project manager : because it also sets it apart from the crowd .
marketing executive : we have done all the background work to go for that if they want it .
project manager : they like their gadgets , they like something that is completely different . it is something completely different associated with your company . right , so
marketing executive : so if we take voice recognition out
industrial designer : that will do it . twelve point three five .
user interface designer : we are close to the budget .
marketing executive : we are .
industrial designer : is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ?
user interface designer : two five .
project manager : it is two point five . no , it is twelve point two five .
marketing executive : are you ? , not meaning to doubt your words there .
project manager : two , twelve point two five times two is twenty five ,
marketing executive : are they really going to quibble about ten p _ ? or point zero one of a euro ?
user interface designer : it is twelve point five maybe , then .
project manager : is not it ?
marketing executive : which is less than ten p _ .
user interface designer : i what it said fifty percent of the cost . so half of the price would be
project manager : the agenda one was where the price was , was not it ?
user interface designer : it is the first one .
marketing executive : that is today is kick off meeting , .
project manager : twelve point five .
marketing executive : . that is what it was .
user interface designer : so we are under the budget .
project manager : done , people .
marketing executive : so we are .
project manager : is that got us covered for the electronics then ? we do not need something else to take that place ?
industrial designer : that was just a bought - on extra , you could just take that out and that would be fine , .
user interface designer : seems fine .
industrial designer : that is brilliant .
user interface designer : except voice recognition , everything is
project manager : so we have done that . product evaluation . we have done room for creativity , because we have got decisions that we would have made that we were not did not feel able to make . i presume we discussed leadership and teamwork .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : in the sense that did you feel like a team ? or did you feel like autonomy ?
industrial designer : i would say , as a team .
user interface designer : we had a time .
marketing executive : although we had our separate tasks , there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to bounce off each other .
industrial designer : find out from each other ,
marketing executive : and i have certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we have been able to , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary .
user interface designer : there was very constructive feedback by everybody . it is not like people trying to cut each other . there is more of true cohesive teamwork . we came to a very predic creative design , . and sarah , you coordinated the work very .
project manager : how did you find it ?
industrial designer : no , it went really and i , i feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we did not quite make the voice recognition in there , but that is good . it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if we would seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , maybe it would have come out a d little different ,
project manager : i liked the fact that we could say an idea and it would be suggested that was not the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , y it did not matter it saying what you thought , because if it was not something that was that relevant , then it did not matter , it was just another idea in the field . you two created that wonderful specimen of a play - doh model .
user interface designer : that was the best part
project manager : i am still not caught up .
user interface designer : of the
project manager : but that is nothing to do with the teamwork .
marketing executive : maybe we should think of branching out into children is toys and fake mobile phones as a side line . and fake r_c_s .
project manager : maybe . that was quite fun . means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ?
industrial designer : discuss which ones
marketing executive : how do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ? could ithave been better , was it adequate ?
industrial designer : we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually had more time and if we would been separated more .
project manager : had time to we could just say , what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it , but it was having it there . like the whole picture of the thing .
user interface designer : moving around the room . but it is good , like we spent times individually . i never thought of a remote control with a flip top .
project manager : it is new ideas in general ,
marketing executive : it is really borrowing from other areas , it is , bringing things from other areas in ,
project manager : rather than
marketing executive : it so it is nothing is new , but it is applying it to a d in a different area .
industrial designer : vegetables .
user interface designer : that is mine .
project manager : no .
user interface designer : it is
project manager : they have to come from somewhere , do not they ?
marketing executive : .
project manager : and as sh as w
user interface designer :
project manager : you go .
user interface designer : go on sarah .
project manager : as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one is thought about it particularly . they are slightly different , so if someone is been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else is , it is w something we should think about , but no one is put any great deal of thought into it .
industrial designer : i do i do not think the companies are really concerned . they are just like we have got a d_v_d _ player , does anyone remember the remote control ? ca not you get the one that we used for the last one ? just jazz it up a bit . d they do not really think about it , because normally , the remote control is not the product which they are trying to ship . they are trying to ship the d_v_d _ player , the video player , the t_v _ .
marketing executive : the focus is not on to that , .
project manager : but then when it everything is really smart , and you have just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it does not go , if you could have something that is a proper funky thing , a funky item that is individual , individual to you , they could even go into you go in with an idea and they design it on photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic , you would pray you would pay a lot extra , because it is individually being a plastic was being made for you . but people could have anything that they wanted .
user interface designer : surprising to me is like people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch like that .
project manager : because of the produ
user interface designer : and new f television products coming up , but nobody giving much idea to this . like sarah was telling , everything is
marketing executive : it is really good that this has been very market research based , because just going back to mobile phones , this is the first change in remote control devices that really , say is obvious and visible . we see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that is where we have borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . there are innovations in that people do not really want . i see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they ca not get it anymore and it is innovation for innovation is sake , and it is wonderful our company is so r _ and d _ based .
project manager : it is innovation for money is sake . the the people have to keep buying .
marketing executive : but forcing it onto people , it is things that , they might want to buy the thing they really want .
project manager : and you ca not get you have got your handset that works fine , but you ca not get the battery anymore for that type of phone ,
marketing executive : .
project manager : because the phones have moved on , things like that .
marketing executive : or there is not a cover to fit it or whatever ,
project manager : it is madness .
marketing executive : see
project manager : in closing there we go . our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased , but i , d what do you think ? do you think that is takes into account overheads like us being paid a thing ? and the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ?
marketing executive : it was just the produc just the production cost of the phone .
industrial designer : that was just the physical .
project manager : so it looks like it is gonna be fifty percent profit , you have still got all of the overheads to come out of that . so maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it is sold at .
user interface designer : maybe fifty percent more .
project manager : but but you were saying that is quite
industrial designer : i do not from the market research .
marketing executive : but in the remit that we were given , it was very specific . we have done what we were required to do , and there will have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at those things . i do not think that is something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for .
industrial designer : it was
marketing executive : we have done very to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item that people are really gonna want .
project manager : it is a shame it wo not ever get made .
user interface designer : who knows ?
project manager : maybe it will .
marketing executive : maybe it will . maybe they are gonna steal our ideas
project manager : maybe someonewill r run down and patent it .
industrial designer : i it is top secret . it is it is it is a conspiracy going on here . that is what it is .
marketing executive : and sell it .
project manager : the project has been evaluated and truly . and we have got the meeting survey and questionnaire .
user interface designer : there is a final questionnaire .
project manager : so we have got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that i fell behind with ,
industrial designer : in your
project manager : so i will be delegating in my role as project supervisor , so good luck .
user interface designer : celebration , you did not talk about that .
project manager : the celebration is the twenty five pounds . either that or we will be dancing on the desks .
marketing executive : questionnaire .
industrial designer : is that it then ?
project manager : just the last , .
industrial designer : awesome .
project manager : i have got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy .
marketing executive : questionnaire done . i did not have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time .
industrial designer : was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you would done in your thing ?
marketing executive : right .
industrial designer : i do not think .
marketing executive : but do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too ?
industrial designer : the s , questionnaire seven was the one i did just before the meeting .","the project manager went over decisions from the previous meeting . the industrial designer presented the prototype and discussed its look , its internal components , and its interface . the marketing expert evaluated the product according to the initial product goals . the group then decided that enough of this criteria had been satisfied for the project to continue . the project manager presented the final cost of the device which exceeded the initial projected price point . the group decided to remove speech recognition but to propose to the management that it  remain in the design . the group then discussed their effectiveness as a team . all members felt that they interacted well and that they felt they could be creative . the marketing expert felt that the market-research based approach would help the project's success with consumers . the group did express , however , that the budget was overly constraining . the project manager instructed the group to fill out a final evaluation questionnaire . the group will suggest to the management that speech recognition remain in the product design . all members will fill out a final evaluation questionnaire . it was decided that the speech recognition component seemed feasible , so it was added to the prototype design to provide a device locator function . it was removed when the project exceeded its initial budget , but it will be suggested to the management that the speech recognition should remain in the product design . the plastic case will be a neutral color , and the changeable rubber cases will be available in vibrant , fruit colors . the lcd screen will appear only in black and white . the company logo will appear on the inside of the device when opened . the group decided that the device fulfilled enough of the project's initial goals to continue in production . there was a lack of cost information at the beginning of the project . the group did not know how much the features made available to them actually cost until the prototype was constructed; their prototype design may have been different had this information been available at the beginning .
","the user interface designer and industrial designer presented the prototype they had created and discussed with the group . they discussed using kinetic batteries , a fruit-inspired look and feel , and voice recognition . the marketing expert moderated the presentation and the industrial designer led the group in a discussion of the internal workings of the device . after the meeting the project manager announced that the remote would use a lcd screen instead of a touch screen , which the group felt was too complicated . he suggested using a clip to hold the remote in order to prevent it from getting lost . it was decided to use an rspongy material instead of the traditional rubber buttons and to make it easy to use .",x,,,,,,,,6.0,T5-Baseline
40,"project manager : good afternoon . this is our third meeting already .
marketing executive : good afternoon .
project manager : i hope you enjoyed your lunch . presentation three . this is the second phase we are going to discuss today . it is the conceptual design meeting . and a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components . conceptual specification of design . and also trend - watching . these are hopefully the points you addressed in your pre presentations you are going to show me in a few minutes . but first i will show you the agenda . first the opening . then we have three presentations . after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . how we are going to make it . and then we are closing . we have about forty minutes . so i suggest let is get started . did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ?
user interface designer : no .
project manager : everything fine ? then a little thing about the last meeting . these are the points we on . the requirements and the target market . requirements are teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that button information . and we are going to use default materials . does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? these are just the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . and maybe we can work it out . and we are going to target sixty to eighty year old customers . so now everybody knows what we are do we are doing , i suggest let is get started with the presentations . shall we keep the same line - up as last time ?
marketing executive : i will start off then .
project manager : good luck .
marketing executive : doh . i am gonna inform you about the trend - watching i have done over the past few days . we have done some market research . we distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . and besides that i deployed some trend - watchers to milan and paris to get all of the newest trends . and i have consulted some additional trend - watch trend - watchers , after the original trend - watchers return , about what the best design would be . these are some overall findings . most important thing is the fancy design . the research indicated that was by far the most important factor . innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . by innovativeness this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls . about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . for our group , we are focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is , these factors are slightly more equal . these are some more group specific findings . the older people prefer dark colours . they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is the material for older people . this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about the look - and - feel that the remote should have . this leads us to some personal preferences . the remote control and the docking station should blend in the room . so this would mean no eye - catching designs . just keep it simple and the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the these would be the innovativeness in the remote control . so this would be very important that we at least include these features . the trend - watchers i consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone - shaped . so you could imagine that the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . this is not really this is a new shape to older people . so they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . so it would be kinda more telephone - shaped . besides that we would advise to bring two editions , one with a wood - like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey - black colour . the wood - like for the more exclusive people . people with more money . the grey - black colour for people with less means . that would be all .
project manager : any questions about the trends ?
marketing executive : any questions ?
project manager : mayb
user interface designer : no .
project manager : we go on to the next one .
user interface designer : some research a about designing of an interface . the last meeting we had a about using a f few buttons . so that is w what i want to do in our design . finding an attractive way to control the remote control . the i found some something about speech recognition . maybe we can use that . and using a little display . just we have just to focus on the primary functions . only buttons for sound , for on - off , shifting u up sa ca channel or down shifting down . and we need some new a attractive functions which attract people for using it . it is like a speak speech recognition and a special button for selecting subtitles . just what we mentioned last meeting . and overall user - friendly . using large buttons . it is possible to make quite cheap system for speech recognition . you can think about when you lost your remote control , you can call it and it gives an sig signal . and and for shifting up a sen c ch channel or for putting out sound , you can just give a sign say sound off or a and television put the sound off . i was thinking about the special button for subtitles , just one button to keep it simple . one push on the button you get small subtitles . double push , if double click , so you get big subtitles , for people which c f who ca not read small subtitles . and w we have to keep in general buttons so we have got the buttons we have to use . the on - off , sound higher or lower , the numbers , zero to nine . the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down channel . also we want to use a little d display for displaying the functions of the buttons . and we can build in a function f which shows the channel or some which the t television is on . made a little picture of it . just we can put the on - off button over in this corner , almost e all remote controls are using a on - off button on that place . so people will recognise the button . d display of it , it is just a small display . you can put it on top . it is most place where people , most of looks at . and a special button for shifting up and shifting down channel , it is on place where the thumb of the so you can easily shift up or shift down . it is quite handy place . so and all the f functions for subtitle one button , for sound and for our design , we have to discuss about it so the form of it and that is it .
industrial designer : about the components design . for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . but if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . so i do not think it is really an option . for the casing , the manufacturing department can deliver a flat casing , single or double curved casing . it is really up the design that we are gonna use . it is does not imply any technical restrictions . as a case supplement , we could , of that l later , a rubber belt , like a anti - slip . for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . and the chip - set , it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we are using an l_c_d _ screen . and as the trend - watcher presentation showed , people like wood , but it raises the price and it does not really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . form should follow function overall . the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . but depends on what we want . we should disc discuss that . for the case , the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . and the chip - set really should be advanced because otherwise it would really be a simple remote control . and that is it .
project manager : that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . so these are the points we have to discuss . first we can talk about the energy source , since that is has a pretty big influence on production price , and image . so f first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , .
industrial designer : yes w there are four options . we could use the basic normal battery . a hand dynamo . but i do not think that is really an option . you do not wanna swing before you can watch television . but not every room is very light so it is not a very good option .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : or the kinetic energy .
project manager : .
marketing executive : and how exactly does the kinetic energy work ?
industrial designer : y you shake your remote , and then it powers up .
marketing executive : you just you use it and it works .
user interface designer : nah .
marketing executive : personally i do not think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : and besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . and our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can get great popularity for our product .
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : wel
user interface designer : what is the function ? f for loading up the batteries
marketing executive : you could load up the batteries ,
user interface designer : b b
marketing executive : you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there .
user interface designer : but it wo not use much e energy i believe . it is just a small display so i believe it will run on one battery for six months or f or more . so i believe one battery is just enough .
project manager : elderly people just like to have everything in place .
marketing executive : that is true .
project manager : and i do not think they like remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . so maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and also what you said . you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : but it is more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . so you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . and then we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the channels .
marketing executive : i am wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ?
project manager : . that is a good point .
industrial designer : i do not have any information on pricing . so i will have to ask the manufacturing department .
marketing executive : in our earlier market research , if you would allow me to go to the flat board , smartboard .
project manager : .
marketing executive : so it was open here . we also asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . you can see here , our target group would not do that . so if that would increase the price for which we are selling our remote control i would greatly advise not to do it . that would be better to insert in our other product , that is meant for the younger people .
industrial designer : but that would also go for the l_c_d _ screen then i . it is a bit higher percentage , but
marketing executive : this is but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . so that does not really mean they would not pay extra for it . and on top of that the l_c_d _ screen would help in making the remote control easier to use . and a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use .
project manager : easier to use ? no , that is a good point .
user interface designer : but is our research about bi large l_c_d _ sh display , or just a small one we want to use ?
marketing executive : this was for like an l_c_d _ screen like you would have on a on the most advanced mobile phones . so pretty large .
project manager : i personally think the l_c_d _ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , nobody has anything against it . because it is just some extra information , and it is easy to ignore as . so if you do not wanna use it you just do not use it . and the maybe we have to discard the voice recognition . because it will increase cost signifi significantly . and i do not think the i do not think it will be a lot easier to use , as . that brings us back to the energy . if we do not have the voice recognition , it will it wo not use a lot of energy to use . in that case we could use kinetic energy , but just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . and much cheaper as .
industrial designer : and that is the best choice .
project manager : let me just choose for the battery . that brings us to the chip .
industrial designer : there is not any choice there because we are using the display .
project manager : just the advanced .
industrial designer : so it is got ta be advanced .
project manager : advanced chip . and then we get to the point of the case . which brings us a little bit back to marketing as . if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . as we saw there is not wood is a lot more expensive to produce .
marketing executive :  .
project manager : but it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . look i have got a new remote control , and
marketing executive : and most important factor there is the wooden colour . so it would not actually have to be wood , if it is just wood - coloured .
project manager : but with colour was a lot more expensive ?
industrial designer : i will have to research .
project manager : because
marketing executive : probably .
project manager : it is a lot more difficult to handle and to get in the right shape .
user interface designer : is it possible to make changeable case . you with mobile phones so like the nokia mobile phones , when you can change the case of it .
project manager : change the cases .
user interface designer : maybe it is possible possibility . you have just to make one standard remote control , and you can sell few
project manager : you can sell the cases . that is a very good option . because then you can advertise as with the give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . because that is a it is something extra , it is something other remotes do not have , which we can get a great advantage point .
marketing executive : that is true .
project manager : and then you can make them with colour . black and grey , other colours as .
marketing executive : we would have to look carefully into the design though .
project manager : costs .
marketing executive : we would have to make one w control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . the more original one , or the more standard one . so that would
project manager : you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , .
marketing executive : i would not design a telephone but no w we should just , we should then just design one
project manager : remote .
marketing executive : one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . so , but that should not be too much of a problem .
project manager : everybody is with the changing covers ? that is a good option .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : changing case covers .
marketing executive : i heard our industrial designer talk about flat , single and double curved . could you explain that a little more ?
industrial designer : the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . and our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases .
marketing executive : and what would single curved and double curved mean ?
industrial designer : it would just only affect the form , for as far as i know . so it is j really just up to the design department what we are gonna use . it does not really matter for the price or the functionality .
marketing executive : so we can just do whatever we want .
industrial designer : pick one you like , yes .
marketing executive : that is good .
project manager : but the form has to be it has to it is has to be possible to stand up ? or just only to lie down ?
marketing executive : no just to lie down .
project manager : and the cover of the docking station is also
marketing executive : we will go for that .
project manager : on top of the television then ?
marketing executive : or besides it .
project manager : and you can just then click it in . the interface . what type of interface do we want to use ? maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the board . does somebody have ideas for a form or
user interface designer : we can just use the regular form of it , but it is not quite fancy .
marketing executive : you said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side , so you could , so your thumb would be easily that was a very good point i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes r_s_i _ . so that would be great for that . maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side .
user interface designer : for for
marketing executive : for left - handed users also .
user interface designer : we is it possible to program it s so you got on the left side or on the right side buttons for shifting u up and shifting up ? and on the other o other side buttons for shifting , for the sound ?
marketing executive : for the volume . that could we could do that but i am not if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use .
project manager : usabili ease of use will be a lot more difficult , and then it is
marketing executive : but if we would make a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . it could be made all symmetrical and .
project manager : but you have extra buttons .
user interface designer : but
project manager : so people can get confused .
marketing executive : that is true .
project manager : especially if they have the same writings on it .
user interface designer : see . or we have to make a left for lefties
project manager : ca not we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same functions as the normal one ?
user interface designer : you mean
project manager : then you have to
user interface designer : if
project manager : let is see if i ca a blank one . and then you get here is a little l_c_d _ screen . now i have to think . it is a plus and a min . no it is not very handy . because the plus and the min will be opposite and all kinds of no that is not gonna work . maybe we should but is it a problem that left - handed persons use a different hand ? the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing a channel
marketing executive : .
user interface designer : it is just u using your thumb .
project manager : y .
user interface designer : it is
project manager : we could just leave it a normal shape . but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy . in one or ano another way .
industrial designer : we should start by choosing a case . because that is the basis you are building on . i could draw them out .
project manager : just
industrial designer : let is look at the flat case . it is from the side so it is rather normal . the the single curved so i am not really what they are gonna look like , but it is something like this . this type should be better for you or better should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit .
project manager : easier ?
industrial designer : and the double curved s looks something like this i . th those are the three options we have .
project manager : i suggest the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the screen in . so that elderly people can use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it is a bit , it has a bit of a angle .
user interface designer : do you say this s you got like a i believe there ? you want to put a display over here ?
project manager : . but now it is
user interface designer : we can make it
project manager : do you have it upside down
user interface designer : ?
project manager : do you have it
user interface designer : that is the top .
project manager : this that is top ?
user interface designer : this top . maybe it is possible to make this side like let is see . colour to make this side like the right colour . bit like so in the form of your hand . it is an so so the remote control have to lay in your hand . it is possib for s so and
project manager : get your mouse .
user interface designer : and to put the buttons for changing the channel over here
project manager : . that is a good one . but it is better to put the screen on top .
user interface designer : rem
project manager : just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here .
user interface designer : but this place
project manager : if you can have this one , you turn it like this . and then flip it upside down . because maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here .
industrial designer : it is more logical to have it on top as
project manager : i
industrial designer : because , like on your mobile phone , it is always above .
project manager : on top .
industrial designer : maybe you should just s start on a blank page .
project manager : then we get here is that is the curve .
user interface designer : five minutes .
project manager : here the display , and then buttons . and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . just that is for left hand and right hand users . and then h the rest of the buttons over here .
user interface designer : but the on - off button , still on the top
project manager : still here jus that is
marketing executive : and i would prefer the corners to be round .
user interface designer : .
project manager : should be more bit more friendly ,
marketing executive : think that would be better . friendly on the eye .
project manager : supplements . where is my mouse ? then we have got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we are going to use . so now for the next meeting we will have to look at the look - and - feel design . it is important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote . so check out the corporate website maybe . the user interface design , it is the same story . and product evaluation . so the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one . but you are going to get your instructions sended by the coach . just i will put these minutes on the in the folder . and then we are going to try to finish our project , and make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , . which are i am not if you are going to start right away to work together you are going to fill in the questionnaires first . and then you will get a message . maybe this one ? then we can save this one in the folders group . yes , it is here . smartboard , there it . if you wanna have a look at it , it is over there in the projects folder . and then i we will start in thirty minutes again .
marketing executive : very good .",,"the project manager opened the meeting and introduced the project , describing the scope of the project , the target group and the decisions to be made . the marketing expert discussed trend watching reports and user preferences . the trend watching reports indicated that a fancy design was the most important factor when choosing a remote , followed by innovativeness , ease of use , and appearance . the user interface designer presented the basic functions of a remote control device and discussed options for materials , buttons , and shapes . the industrial designer discussed options for energy sources , chips , and case materials . the user interface designer also discussed the layout of the interface , recommending that the remote be small and simple and include buttons for teletext , volume and mute , and a power button . the project manager briefed the team on some new requirements . the team then discussed and decided on the appearance of the remote , the materials to use , buttons , and the docking station . the industrial designer will work on the look and feel of the design . the user interface designer and the industrial designer will work on a prototype . the marketing expert will work on trend watching reports . the remote will not feature a teletext feature . the remote will feature a fancy design . the remote will be small and simple . the remote will feature buttons . the remote will be in a shape similar to a telephone . the remote will be in a color . the remote will not feature a teletext feature . the remote will feature",X,X,,,,X,,,8.0,Pegasus-Baseline
41,"project manager : good afternoon . this is our third meeting already .
marketing executive : good afternoon .
project manager : i hope you enjoyed your lunch . presentation three . this is the second phase we are going to discuss today . it is the conceptual design meeting . and a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components . conceptual specification of design . and also trend - watching . these are hopefully the points you addressed in your pre presentations you are going to show me in a few minutes . but first i will show you the agenda . first the opening . then we have three presentations . after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . how we are going to make it . and then we are closing . we have about forty minutes . so i suggest let is get started . did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ?
user interface designer : no .
project manager : everything fine ? then a little thing about the last meeting . these are the points we on . the requirements and the target market . requirements are teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that button information . and we are going to use default materials . does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? these are just the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . and maybe we can work it out . and we are going to target sixty to eighty year old customers . so now everybody knows what we are do we are doing , i suggest let is get started with the presentations . shall we keep the same line - up as last time ?
marketing executive : i will start off then .
project manager : good luck .
marketing executive : doh . i am gonna inform you about the trend - watching i have done over the past few days . we have done some market research . we distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . and besides that i deployed some trend - watchers to milan and paris to get all of the newest trends . and i have consulted some additional trend - watch trend - watchers , after the original trend - watchers return , about what the best design would be . these are some overall findings . most important thing is the fancy design . the research indicated that was by far the most important factor . innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . by innovativeness this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls . about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . for our group , we are focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is , these factors are slightly more equal . these are some more group specific findings . the older people prefer dark colours . they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is the material for older people . this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about the look - and - feel that the remote should have . this leads us to some personal preferences . the remote control and the docking station should blend in the room . so this would mean no eye - catching designs . just keep it simple and the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the these would be the innovativeness in the remote control . so this would be very important that we at least include these features . the trend - watchers i consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone - shaped . so you could imagine that the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . this is not really this is a new shape to older people . so they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . so it would be kinda more telephone - shaped . besides that we would advise to bring two editions , one with a wood - like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey - black colour . the wood - like for the more exclusive people . people with more money . the grey - black colour for people with less means . that would be all .
project manager : any questions about the trends ?
marketing executive : any questions ?
project manager : mayb
user interface designer : no .
project manager : we go on to the next one .
user interface designer : some research a about designing of an interface . the last meeting we had a about using a f few buttons . so that is w what i want to do in our design . finding an attractive way to control the remote control . the i found some something about speech recognition . maybe we can use that . and using a little display . just we have just to focus on the primary functions . only buttons for sound , for on - off , shifting u up sa ca channel or down shifting down . and we need some new a attractive functions which attract people for using it . it is like a speak speech recognition and a special button for selecting subtitles . just what we mentioned last meeting . and overall user - friendly . using large buttons . it is possible to make quite cheap system for speech recognition . you can think about when you lost your remote control , you can call it and it gives an sig signal . and and for shifting up a sen c ch channel or for putting out sound , you can just give a sign say sound off or a and television put the sound off . i was thinking about the special button for subtitles , just one button to keep it simple . one push on the button you get small subtitles . double push , if double click , so you get big subtitles , for people which c f who ca not read small subtitles . and w we have to keep in general buttons so we have got the buttons we have to use . the on - off , sound higher or lower , the numbers , zero to nine . the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down channel . also we want to use a little d display for displaying the functions of the buttons . and we can build in a function f which shows the channel or some which the t television is on . made a little picture of it . just we can put the on - off button over in this corner , almost e all remote controls are using a on - off button on that place . so people will recognise the button . d display of it , it is just a small display . you can put it on top . it is most place where people , most of looks at . and a special button for shifting up and shifting down channel , it is on place where the thumb of the so you can easily shift up or shift down . it is quite handy place . so and all the f functions for subtitle one button , for sound and for our design , we have to discuss about it so the form of it and that is it .
industrial designer : about the components design . for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . but if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . so i do not think it is really an option . for the casing , the manufacturing department can deliver a flat casing , single or double curved casing . it is really up the design that we are gonna use . it is does not imply any technical restrictions . as a case supplement , we could , of that l later , a rubber belt , like a anti - slip . for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . and the chip - set , it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we are using an l_c_d _ screen . and as the trend - watcher presentation showed , people like wood , but it raises the price and it does not really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . form should follow function overall . the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . but depends on what we want . we should disc discuss that . for the case , the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . and the chip - set really should be advanced because otherwise it would really be a simple remote control . and that is it .
project manager : that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . so these are the points we have to discuss . first we can talk about the energy source , since that is has a pretty big influence on production price , and image . so f first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , .
industrial designer : yes w there are four options . we could use the basic normal battery . a hand dynamo . but i do not think that is really an option . you do not wanna swing before you can watch television . but not every room is very light so it is not a very good option .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : or the kinetic energy .
project manager : .
marketing executive : and how exactly does the kinetic energy work ?
industrial designer : y you shake your remote , and then it powers up .
marketing executive : you just you use it and it works .
user interface designer : nah .
marketing executive : personally i do not think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : and besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . and our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can get great popularity for our product .
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : wel
user interface designer : what is the function ? f for loading up the batteries
marketing executive : you could load up the batteries ,
user interface designer : b b
marketing executive : you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there .
user interface designer : but it wo not use much e energy i believe . it is just a small display so i believe it will run on one battery for six months or f or more . so i believe one battery is just enough .
project manager : elderly people just like to have everything in place .
marketing executive : that is true .
project manager : and i do not think they like remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . so maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place .
user interface designer : .
project manager : and also what you said . you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote .
user interface designer :  .
project manager : but it is more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . so you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . and then we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the channels .
marketing executive : i am wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ?
project manager : . that is a good point .
industrial designer : i do not have any information on pricing . so i will have to ask the manufacturing department .
marketing executive : in our earlier market research , if you would allow me to go to the flat board , smartboard .
project manager : .
marketing executive : so it was open here . we also asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . you can see here , our target group would not do that . so if that would increase the price for which we are selling our remote control i would greatly advise not to do it . that would be better to insert in our other product , that is meant for the younger people .
industrial designer : but that would also go for the l_c_d _ screen then i . it is a bit higher percentage , but
marketing executive : this is but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . so that does not really mean they would not pay extra for it . and on top of that the l_c_d _ screen would help in making the remote control easier to use . and a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use .
project manager : easier to use ? no , that is a good point .
user interface designer : but is our research about bi large l_c_d _ sh display , or just a small one we want to use ?
marketing executive : this was for like an l_c_d _ screen like you would have on a on the most advanced mobile phones . so pretty large .

marketing executive :  .
project manager : but it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . look i have got a new remote control , and
marketing executive : and most important factor there is the wooden colour . so it would not actually have to be wood , if it is just wood - coloured .

marketing executive : very good .",,"the marketing expert presented the results of trend watching reports and showed that users of 60 to 80 years old preferred dark colors and recessive shapes to other remote controls . the trend watchers also indicated that older users wanted a remote that was less eye-catching , featured fewer buttons , and featured more of a wooden look and feel , rather than a square or rectangular design . she also showed that younger users liked the grey-black color and that the project would produce two different editions of the remote , to appeal to both the company slogan and the company colours and the logo will be on the device , which will be sold for 25 euros with a profit of 12.50 euro to the company's design , the company will not produce a sample speakerphone , but it will be made of wood and rubber for the remote with lcd screen and audio signal . this project manager instructed the user interface designer and the industrial designer to build the components of the design on the 3D printing of the prototype , with the design to incorporate the corporate color and the design in the product . all participants will fill out a questionnaire following: the team will build the prototype: the remote will feature a rubber-covered in a special gray-black colour . audio signal will be provided through the remote by the user's owns own a nickel-colored rubber-like feel . there will be no display menu button , nor will be a single-colored device with yellow or",X,X,X,X,,X,,,3.0,T5-Cons
42,"project manager : so hello .
marketing executive : good afternoon . i am a little late .
project manager : no problem .
marketing executive : got stuck in the traffic .
project manager : that is possible on this time of day . starts at three o'clock . our fourth and last meeting . this our last meeting . in this meeting we will discuss our final design . and we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . and then we are going to close the project today as . after this you will be free to go and spend all your money . and this design , detailed design meeting we will discuss the look - and - feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . , in order to do that we have this agenda . we will have the prototype presentation first . then we will set up some evaluation cri criteria . then we will look at the finance . we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . so we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half euro per remote . but we will see that later . then we will do the project evaluation , and the closing after that . we have got forty minutes . so we will be finished at half past three . but first we will do the this is prototype presentation . so , if some if somebody wants step forward .
industrial designer : this is what me and richard came up with . the default spot for the on - off button . the mute button just below that . then there is the volume and channel selectors . simple plus - minus button . we thought of a help button . if you hold it and you press another button , the help goes to the l_c_d _ screen . then there is the zero to one to zero buttons . a button for teletext . a button for the subtitles . and the company logo . so it is rather simple prototype . and we will have to see from testing how the users take it .
marketing executive : is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ?
user interface designer : so .
industrial designer : just pop in at any time .
marketing executive : when you are in teletext there usually are buttons where you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page .
user interface designer : that is just the normal as th as the normal remote controls you put it you came in page one hundred . now you can use the normal one to zero buttons .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : and you but you can also use the button th for changing the channel . s so the shifting button . for shif shifting up in on t teletext , and shifting down . so
marketing executive : .
project manager : . but in a few meetings earlier we tried to keep it simple . just a few buttons and large buttons .
user interface designer : ?
project manager : but these are altogether quite a few buttons . so i am wondering if we neely really need all of those buttons .
industrial designer : if you look at most controls , they have got more buttons than this . and the on - off button , it is a necessity . you ca not drop that one . the volume and channel buttons , you need those . the mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume - down button twice . so we could cancel that one . the help button really is necessary because there is no other way to know when someone wants to a button does .
user interface designer : or you can build in when you press one button
project manager : long time . if you put
user interface designer : but m we disc discuss that already . but we think old people that option . so they just put in put press the button and
project manager : .
industrial designer : you ca not leave out the number buttons i .
user interface designer : and
project manager : teletext and subtitles are necessary .
industrial designer : so it is rather basic already .
marketing executive : that is what i pointed out earlier . if you just make a control for just the t_v _ there is just not much to gain here .
project manager : . so we had somebody about th interfa something about the design of the buttons there ?
industrial designer : they are
project manager : just n normal plain buttons .
user interface designer : . ,
industrial designer : it is rather hard to draw on the white - board .
user interface designer : it
industrial designer : but they are supposed to be equal sized , round , with a little logo on it for the volume , the triangle and .
user interface designer : just to recognise it , so
industrial designer : just for recognition .
user interface designer : and now we do not need leds or y
project manager : no .
user interface designer : s some remote controls do it also , but because we use the little display we do not have to use it .
industrial designer : so and for the materials we have just chosen for rubber buttons . with a different colour than the case .
user interface designer : nay .
industrial designer : so they jump out . and that is about it .
project manager : that is . then because we only have thirty minutes left , i will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it is all possible what we wanna do . and tell you that we are going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half euros . if we see i if i have filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see something wrong . i counted two batteries . but maybe we can also use one . i if it is possible .
marketing executive : since it rechargeable .
project manager : it is rechargeable .
user interface designer : we can u just
project manager : that is two euros off . we need the advanced chip . so there is not much to save there . here we have the single curves . we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one euro . , i , but the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . we have to keep that .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : then we have the case material supplements . it is plastic . it is the cheapest one we need . so that is not much to save either . but then the biggest costs are the buttons . so maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our costs low . because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half euros at the end . , so if we let is fir first count the buttons we have now .
user interface designer : sixteen , i believe so .
project manager : because i sixteen . nah , that will be even more then . eighteen euros .
user interface designer : seventeen . with the help button .
project manager : seventeen . , including the help ?
marketing executive : damn .
project manager : . we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a number long . that saves us one euro already . then we have got fifteen ?
marketing executive : would not
project manager : fifteen buttons .
marketing executive : no . that would not be an option .
project manager : and this is
marketing executive : d i assume you would count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ?
project manager : no those are one , .
user interface designer : where did
marketing executive : think actually there are two buttons ,
user interface designer : it is just one button .
marketing executive : are not they ?
user interface designer : but , . there were two for one big button . but they are more expensive than the small ones . so
project manager : but th it is not stated in this files .
user interface designer : it is just a .
project manager : so maybe we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing
marketing executive : i was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button .
project manager : that is possibility as .
marketing executive : that would cut the cost .
project manager : and it is good for the design as . so you can make let is see . if you make this looks a bit like a cross .
user interface designer : but i if it is cheaper .
project manager : s channel .
user interface designer : so ,
project manager : w
user interface designer : we have still got four buttons , but just so
project manager : th they count the materials .
user interface designer : you got not a butt button itself , but on the
project manager : on the chip there .
user interface designer : on the chip you have got still four buttons .
project manager : but because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button .
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : but , this really is four buttons anyhow .
project manager : but no but . maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it is impossible to get the twelve and a half euros . also the l_c _ display , it is too expensive for the display we use .
marketing executive : yes .
industrial designer : that is a big cost .
project manager : they try t
industrial designer : if we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip .
project manager : but what is the big advantage of our remote then ?
marketing executive : only the docking station , i .
industrial designer : which is not the docking station is not even in this c s schematic . it is not even taken into the price .
project manager : that is extra .
marketing executive : maybe we should to a different supplier .
project manager : that is an option . polish supplier . do not you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as .
industrial designer : we we could save money on it . but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ?
marketing executive : that is what i am wondering .
industrial designer : my mother ca not even send an s_m_s _ message .
project manager : . that is a point .
user interface designer : are we gonna buy a remote control when you can use it ? we m we must stay below the below twelve fifty or ca not go
marketing executive : since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it is feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . especially since we have those features .
project manager : but we have to stick to the twelve and a half euros . we do not have any more budget to develop it .
user interface designer : is it impossible to
industrial designer : the margin will get too small .
user interface designer : but it is possible to make one for twelve fifty .
project manager : it is . if you leave out the l_c _ display . and if you use less buttons . say or you can take the single chip .
user interface designer : i do not .
marketing executive : it would be a pretty rigid one .
user interface designer : s but , you ca not use
industrial designer : ten .
project manager : there it is . but then w good looking .
user interface designer : wi with n , with attractive o options . you can stay below twelve fifty .
project manager : it is difficult as ,
marketing executive : or b becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control .
industrial designer : no remote .
project manager : or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . then w
user interface designer : scroll - wheel is one .
industrial designer : that is
project manager : because then we save ten buttons .
user interface designer : no ,
project manager : then we have five and one . if we have this one and we have got the advanced w , we are getting close .
industrial designer : we are getting closer .
marketing executive : but how does scroll - wheel work here ?
project manager : then you will or maybe you can scroll . if you scroll you will see the numbers on the l_c_d _ display . until you have got the right number , then you push it .
marketing executive : that would bring up the price of the scroll - wheel also . integrated scroll - wheel push - button .
project manager : alright . it is got ta scroll and push . but then you can push some other button as .
marketing executive : but .
industrial designer : you could just not scroll for a half a second .
project manager : . so if you scroll to a number and then you a half second , then it g turns to that channel .
industrial designer : so you wo not need a button .
marketing executive : that would be like the end of our usability .
project manager : but it would definitely crop cost , a lot .
user interface designer : d
marketing executive : but
project manager : and we need the battery . and the regular chip is not possible ? it has to be advanced ?
industrial designer : if you want to use an l_c_d _ screen you need an advanced chip , yes .
project manager : it has to be advanced . and we can save a euro by a flat design . that is an option we can
user interface designer : ja ja .
project manager : then we are almost there .
industrial designer : if you v could just leave out one more button .
project manager : if we
user interface designer : or we have to skip the subtitle button .
project manager : but that is that is a big advantage , if we are
user interface designer : it is a big advantage . but , it is
project manager : can we use ca not we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : so .
project manager : if you push it three times ?
marketing executive : think it is the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight , and teletext disappears . but the subtitles stay there .
user interface designer : but if you push the teletext button twice
industrial designer : what if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? eight hundred eighty eight .
marketing executive : that is the case on most
user interface designer : it is one m one b , a few buttons .
project manager : that is not really that
marketing executive : that could be just like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : but then again that would be d j just not an option for older people ,
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : who do not even a scroll - wheel is . holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . with only five buttons on it . and a scroll - wheel .
project manager : if you make a good advertisement on television and in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . if you just make it real simple . because it saves a lot of money . and we can keep our l_c_d _ screen , which can provide extra information . how to use the scroll wheel . how to use the other bu buttons as subtitles .
marketing executive : true .
project manager : and it is good for the innovative design as . if you would erase these . and we put looks a bit odd maybe .
marketing executive : that is a pretty big scroll wheel .
project manager : that is something like that . we have got the scroll - wheel . one , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . and these are two buttons then .
industrial designer : we could make two buttons out of that . and just if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll - wheel . so that would save two buttons . if you do the same for the channel .
project manager : . that is really a good idea , . and it will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious .
industrial designer : more obvious .
project manager : so we make one for the volume , one for the channel .
industrial designer : if we
project manager : so we have got one , two , three . we can leave the teletext in if we want . that is m that is better .
marketing executive : so this is five buttons .
industrial designer : if we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat case . and make it smaller overall .
project manager : y .
industrial designer : so if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on - off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button
project manager : and then you can
industrial designer : you get a much smaller remote . and it sh
project manager : so we can decrease this one to four buttons .
industrial designer : ?
marketing executive : right now we have five .
user interface designer : but , you can make a f quite a big remote control for just the same price as a small one .
project manager : . that is no problem .
user interface designer : just you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . it it is a bit
project manager : it is it is more the moulds in which they are being made , . single curved is really easy to just fill in . and cases come right out of the machine . and single curved you have to have a different machine , than a flat one . this is a really easy one . , what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? freek , what do you think ?
marketing executive : i still think we should go for the single curve design . but then again , all these changes are not really with me .
industrial designer : richard is argument was very good .
marketing executive : but since we just have to .
project manager : we have to cut costs . i am ag
marketing executive : i would rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a remote .
project manager : ask for more money . i am agreeing with the usability .
marketing executive : or do some market research and see what the options are .
project manager : but th we can then keep the single curved one . just to express our l_c_d _ screen a bit more . so people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . it will be necessary to have good help function , as . this is scroll . it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . before we went on to the whole design .
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : the th
project manager : but i am glad we could make a bit . it is pretty different , if you saw the last one than this one .
marketing executive : it is pretty different . but this is not really like for the group we were making our remote .
user interface designer : no .
marketing executive : this will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell .
project manager : .
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : if older people like familiar forms and familiar . this is not familiar for them .
project manager : no ,
marketing executive : so we are gonna have to do a lotta convincing them .
project manager : the most
user interface designer : but they know the scroll - buttons from old radios . they cal also buttons like that for changing channels .
project manager : we can let l
user interface designer : so maybe it is
project manager : we can stick it out , a bit . like a old buttons . maybe that is recognisable for them as . that is a good one . i am afraid we have to move on . and it is b less frightening , . if they see this design they think , there are only five buttons , and but we will see .
marketing executive : that is true . might might be confusing too .
project manager : . that is definitely right .
user interface designer :  .
marketing executive : they would be like , what ? only five buttons ?
user interface designer : but very special ,
project manager : i would buy it .
marketing executive : but you are not sixty .
project manager : i would buy it if i was six . what it costs under twelve and a half euros ? , yes they are . but we can go on with the project evaluation . we still have fifteen minutes left , so we are on schedule . , the project process .
marketing executive : so , i like set up all these criteria . and evaluation of the thingy .
project manager : evaluation criteria . that was the point i forgot . i should there we are . evaluation criteria . we have got five minutes for those criteria .
marketing executive : five more minutes ?
project manager : no we have got fifteen minutes yes .
marketing executive : so i did some literature study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . translated it into criteria , which would be these . , is the remote fancy ? the shape , look and feel . what new functions are there ? , easy to use ? , learnability is a very important factor here . , is it functional ? are there not too many functions among the functions ? and are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? the target group . is the remote really for the group we are making it for ? and recognability . if our company is if it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? and so we are supposed to evaluate it right now . i have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting were not here .
project manager : that is because my pen failed to upload his data . i tried to
marketing executive : interesting .
project manager : but it is giving errors by downloading the software .
marketing executive : so is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ?
project manager : it is fancy .
industrial designer : six .
project manager : .
user interface designer : six .
marketing executive : we all go for six ? , is the design innovative ?
project manager : very .
user interface designer : . sh
marketing executive : so , with our l_c_d _ screen , docking station , scroll - buttons .
project manager : subtitles , buttons .
marketing executive : seven ?
project manager : so we have got twenty cents for our docking station , ?
marketing executive : should be do - able . is the design easy to use ?
user interface designer : .
project manager : that is a bit dodgy .
marketing executive : would be for us . but
user interface designer : for old people i
project manager : i would say four . four or five between . between four or five .
user interface designer : w
industrial designer : four or five .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : i would go for four , too .
project manager : is it functional ?
marketing executive : is the design functional ? , do we have all functions that we want to include ?
user interface designer : n
marketing executive : we do . do we have too many functions ? it is pretty slim .
project manager : think it is seven .
marketing executive : seven . and do we take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? like it getting lost and r_s_i _ influences ?
user interface designer : m
industrial designer : we have not thought of that one .
project manager : it was .
marketing executive : think we do .
project manager : i had them worked out . they are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost .
marketing executive : are the production costs within the preset limits ? does the design fit the group of focus ?
user interface designer : th .
industrial designer : that is a three .
project manager : with our new radio button , it is better .
marketing executive : it does not .
user interface designer : we have to test it s but
marketing executive : i .
industrial designer : i still it is too m too fancy . too too flashy .
project manager : it
marketing executive : a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control .
user interface designer : true .
project manager : i would give it a four .
marketing executive : i am not . i would go for two .
user interface designer : i go for three .
project manager : then we have to do the three . it is the
marketing executive : is the company recognisable ?
project manager : yes it is .
marketing executive : we have the logo there .
project manager : and they wanna put fashion in their products . in the slogan of the company . and we have the removable front cases . so , it is very recognisable .
marketing executive : so that will be this . i was also supposed to calculate the score , but thought we would have another private thingy after this .
project manager : we have got a calculate it .
industrial designer : twendag sieven an twendag .
marketing executive : is this like after this , are we done ? or
project manager : n we have gonna we are going to evaluate it .
marketing executive : we are gonna go to our other room again . these are seven factors times seven is forty something .
project manager : forty nine .
marketing executive : nine ? minus three , minus four . so that would be minus eight . forty one out of forty nine .
project manager : forty one . that is around eighty percent .
marketing executive : i will just type that in on the bottom here .
project manager : that is eighty four percent . that is a pretty score .
marketing executive : . so that will be the evaluation .
project manager : that brings us to the project evaluation . project process . did we move through the right phases , you think ? along the process ?
user interface designer : but it
marketing executive : think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . in the design phase .
project manager : so lack of information about prices .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : .
project manager : satisfaction . was there room for creativity ?
marketing executive : not too much .
project manager : it is because of the finance sheet .
industrial designer : there w there was enough room , but the finance
marketing executive : true .
project manager : the room was .
marketing executive : and i would have liked to go for the younger users also . and just to be able to access internet and get something of your own .
project manager : restrictions . internet access . was it clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions ? did it work out ? working together ? also , you two of you with the last phase ?
industrial designer : yes , was . the tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it is very easy .
project manager : tasks . were the means sufficient for the tasks we had to do ? or were they too much ?
industrial designer : the smart - board , the d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but the digital the digital pen is very .
project manager : smart - board . if it wants to download its data .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : failed download . smart - board was irritating . so you rather wanted to have a flip - over ?
industrial designer : a flip - over or a more precise digit
user interface designer : a flipper is easier ,
project manager : faster as , .
user interface designer : but if you want to share of when you make a picture like this on the presentation , it is easier to share it with other people . you can sh save it and put it on the internet , or in shared f folder or sh shared directory .
marketing executive : i tried to open the file on my laptop ,
user interface designer : no ?
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : but not possible .
project manager : you need a smart board application . but you can
user interface designer : t can you export it like a .
project manager : . should be possible . you can export it as image .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : must must be
marketing executive : should have done that then .
project manager : the sharing of the information was ?
marketing executive : pen is here .
project manager : network . , pen is here on the table .
user interface designer : you can
project manager : . it is possible .
user interface designer : it is possible .
project manager : have we found new ideas for having this meetings ? or
user interface designer : maybe when we n just give the numbers of o one of out of s sev it is easier to do the th things that are like that on a computer . , so just l like at u university
project manager : so . so everybody puts his own score . and then it mediates the score , and you can get one that is better . so that is how do we call ? evaluation criteria . , any more ideas ? or questions about the project ? or about the product ? because then that we get to our last sheet . are the costs within the budget ?
marketing executive : they are .
industrial designer : considering we are not going to make a docking station .
project manager : do we docking station . that is a good point . but maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ? and you can compensate that as .
industrial designer : perhaps .
project manager : so that should not be the biggest problem , because it is very cheap to make as .
industrial designer :  .
project manager : do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? or what was it ?
marketing executive : fifty grand .
project manager : fifteen fifteen million . if we gonna export this product . it is innovative . especially in america . people are pretty decadent .
marketing executive : still if we are n gonna make a scroll - button anyway it would be more for the younger people than for the older people .
project manager : you can do more .
marketing executive : so maybe we should just re - focus .
project manager : just put it on the market for everybody . you can you can change markets where by changing the front covers .
marketing executive : or specifically for younger people .
project manager : that is one thing you can change it with . so you can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy covers on the market . just as a test . see how it works . that is a good advantage .
marketing executive : then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . even if it were their covers .
project manager : then we can have our little celebration , right now .
marketing executive : party party .
project manager : we still have to fit in one more questionnaire .
user interface designer : where is the champagne ?
project manager : i . i did not get a message from the from ending of the
user interface designer : i believe y
project manager : i have one now .
marketing executive : you did .
project manager : five more minutes ? then we still have some questions . if somebody has some questions they can ask them now . or we can put these in the project folder as . maybe that is export as picture , . this is another network , i . does somebody see the project folder ?
user interface designer : maybe they will save it .
project manager : i will just put it in my documents
marketing executive : it probably will .
project manager : and i am going to make our final presentation now .
marketing executive : you are supposed to make a final
project manager : and then i will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . summary of the project .
marketing executive : are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ?
user interface designer : maybe we have to fill another questionnaire .
project manager : . questionnaire . you all get a questionnaire in your room . and then i will meet you in about ten minutes , . hopefully my pen will download its software .
marketing executive : that would be .",,"the project manager opens the meeting by stating that they will close the project at 4:00 pm . the designers present the prototype , which is a simple design with only a few buttons . they point out that the large number buttons are unnecessary . they also discuss the option to include a teletext button . the marketing expert administers the product evaluation , and they rate the product on the basis of its appearance , technological innovation , ease of use , and its adherence to the company motto . they rate the product using a 7 point scale and come up with an average score of 6.5. they discuss the costs of adding features to the remote , such as the lcd screen and microphone , and the energy source . they discuss whether to charge extra for the extra features . they close the meeting by allocating twelve and a half euro to the project . the designers will work on the final design . the user interface designer and industrial designer will work on the user interface design . the marketing expert will work on the evaluation the remote will cost 12 euros to produce . the remote will not include a teletext button . the remote will have an lcd screen . the remote will have an extra button for teletext . the remote will have an energy source . whether to charge extra for the extra features . whether to include a teletext button . whether to keep the lcd screen .",X,X,,X,,X,,,5.0,Pegasus-Baseline

project manager : that is possible on this time of day . starts at three o'clock . our fourth and last meeting . this our last meeting . in this meeting we will discuss our final design . and we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . and then we are going to close the project today as . after this you will be free to go and spend all your money . and this design , detailed design meeting we will discuss the look - and - feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . , in order to do that we have this agenda . we will have the prototype presentation first . then we will set up some evaluation cri criteria . then we will look at the finance . we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . so we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half euro per remote . but we will see that later . then we will do the project evaluation , and the closing after that . we have got forty minutes . so we will be finished at half past three . but first we will do the this is prototype presentation . so , if some if somebody wants step forward .
industrial designer : this is what me and richard came up with . the default spot for the on - off button . the mute button just below that . then there is the volume and channel selectors . simple plus - minus button . we thought of a help button . if you hold it and you press another button , the help goes to the l_c_d _ screen . then there is the zero to one to zero buttons . a button for teletext . a button for the subtitles . and the company logo . so it is rather simple prototype . and we will have to see from testing how the users take it .
marketing executive : is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ?
user interface designer : so .
industrial designer : just pop in at any time .
marketing executive : when you are in teletext there usually are buttons where you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page .
user interface designer : that is just the normal as th as the normal remote controls you put it you came in page one hundred . now you can use the normal one to zero buttons .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : and you but you can also use the button th for changing the channel . s so the shifting button . for shif shifting up in on t teletext , and shifting down . so
marketing executive : .
project manager : . but in a few meetings earlier we tried to keep it simple . just a few buttons and large buttons .
user interface designer : ?
project manager : but these are altogether quite a few buttons . so i am wondering if we neely really need all of those buttons .
industrial designer : if you look at most controls , they have got more buttons than this . and the on - off button , it is a necessity . you ca not drop that one . the volume and channel buttons , you need those . the mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume - down button twice . so we could cancel that one . the help button really is necessary because there is no other way to know when someone wants to a button does .
user interface designer : or you can build in when you press one button
project manager : long time . if you put
user interface designer : but m we disc discuss that already . but we think old people that option . so they just put in put press the button and
project manager : .
industrial designer : you ca not leave out the number buttons i .
user interface designer : and
project manager : teletext and subtitles are necessary .
industrial designer : so it is rather basic already .
marketing executive : that is what i pointed out earlier . if you just make a control for just the t_v _ there is just not much to gain here .
project manager : . so we had somebody about th interfa something about the design of the buttons there ?
industrial designer : they are
project manager : just n normal plain buttons .
user interface designer : . ,
industrial designer : it is rather hard to draw on the white - board .
user interface designer : it
industrial designer : but they are supposed to be equal sized , round , with a little logo on it for the volume , the triangle and .
user interface designer : just to recognise it , so
industrial designer : just for recognition .
user interface designer : and now we do not need leds or y
project manager : no .
user interface designer : s some remote controls do it also , but because we use the little display we do not have to use it .
industrial designer : so and for the materials we have just chosen for rubber buttons . with a different colour than the case .
user interface designer : nay .
industrial designer : so they jump out . and that is about it .
project manager : that is . then because we only have thirty minutes left , i will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it is all possible what we wanna do . and tell you that we are going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half euros . if we see i if i have filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see something wrong . i counted two batteries . but maybe we can also use one . i if it is possible .
marketing executive : since it rechargeable .
project manager : it is rechargeable .
user interface designer : we can u just
project manager : that is two euros off . we need the advanced chip . so there is not much to save there . here we have the single curves . we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one euro . , i , but the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . we have to keep that .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : then we have the case material supplements . it is plastic . it is the cheapest one we need . so that is not much to save either . but then the biggest costs are the buttons . so maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our costs low . because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half euros at the end . , so if we let is fir first count the buttons we have now .
user interface designer : sixteen , i believe so .
project manager : because i sixteen . nah , that will be even more then . eighteen euros .
user interface designer : seventeen . with the help button .
project manager : seventeen . , including the help ?
marketing executive : damn .
project manager : . we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a number long . that saves us one euro already . then we have got fifteen ?
marketing executive : would not
project manager : fifteen buttons .
marketing executive : no . that would not be an option .
project manager : and this is
marketing executive : d i assume you would count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ?
project manager : no those are one , .
user interface designer : where did
marketing executive : think actually there are two buttons ,
user interface designer : it is just one button .
marketing executive : are not they ?
user interface designer : but , . there were two for one big button . but they are more expensive than the small ones . so
project manager : but th it is not stated in this files .
user interface designer : it is just a .
project manager : so maybe we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing
marketing executive : i was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button .
project manager : that is possibility as .
marketing executive : that would cut the cost .
project manager : and it is good for the design as . so you can make let is see . if you make this looks a bit like a cross .
user interface designer : but i if it is cheaper .
project manager : s channel .
user interface designer : so ,
project manager : w
user interface designer : we have still got four buttons , but just so
project manager : th they count the materials .
user interface designer : you got not a butt button itself , but on the
project manager : on the chip there .
user interface designer : on the chip you have got still four buttons .
project manager : but because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button .
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : but , this really is four buttons anyhow .
project manager : but no but . maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it is impossible to get the twelve and a half euros . also the l_c _ display , it is too expensive for the display we use .
marketing executive : yes .
industrial designer : that is a big cost .
project manager : they try t
industrial designer : if we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip .
project manager : but what is the big advantage of our remote then ?
marketing executive : only the docking station , i .
industrial designer : which is not the docking station is not even in this c s schematic . it is not even taken into the price .
project manager : that is extra .
marketing executive : maybe we should to a different supplier .
project manager : that is an option . polish supplier . do not you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as .
industrial designer : we we could save money on it . but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ?
marketing executive : that is what i am wondering .
industrial designer : my mother ca not even send an s_m_s _ message .
project manager : . that is a point .
user interface designer : are we gonna buy a remote control when you can use it ? we m we must stay below the below twelve fifty or ca not go
marketing executive : since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it is feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . especially since we have those features .
project manager : but we have to stick to the twelve and a half euros . we do not have any more budget to develop it .
user interface designer : is it impossible to
industrial designer : the margin will get too small .
user interface designer : but it is possible to make one for twelve fifty .
project manager : it is . if you leave out the l_c _ display . and if you use less buttons . say or you can take the single chip .
user interface designer : i do not .
marketing executive : it would be a pretty rigid one .
user interface designer : s but , you ca not use
industrial designer : ten .
project manager : there it is . but then w good looking .
user interface designer : wi with n , with attractive o options . you can stay below twelve fifty .
project manager : it is difficult as ,
marketing executive : or b becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control .
industrial designer : no remote .
project manager : or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . then w
user interface designer : scroll - wheel is one .
industrial designer : that is
project manager : because then we save ten buttons .
user interface designer : no ,
project manager : then we have five and one . if we have this one and we have got the advanced w , we are getting close .
industrial designer : we are getting closer .
marketing executive : but how does scroll - wheel work here ?
project manager : then you will or maybe you can scroll . if you scroll you will see the numbers on the l_c_d _ display . until you have got the right number , then you push it .
marketing executive : that would bring up the price of the scroll - wheel also . integrated scroll - wheel push - button .
project manager : alright . it is got ta scroll and push . but then you can push some other button as .
marketing executive : but .
industrial designer : you could just not scroll for a half a second .
project manager : . so if you scroll to a number and then you a half second , then it g turns to that channel .
industrial designer : so you wo not need a button .
marketing executive : that would be like the end of our usability .
project manager : but it would definitely crop cost , a lot .
user interface designer : d
marketing executive : but
project manager : and we need the battery . and the regular chip is not possible ? it has to be advanced ?
industrial designer : if you want to use an l_c_d _ screen you need an advanced chip , yes .
project manager : it has to be advanced . and we can save a euro by a flat design . that is an option we can
user interface designer : ja ja .
project manager : then we are almost there .
industrial designer : if you v could just leave out one more button .
project manager : if we
user interface designer : or we have to skip the subtitle button .
project manager : but that is that is a big advantage , if we are
user interface designer : it is a big advantage . but , it is
project manager : can we use ca not we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : so .
project manager : if you push it three times ?
marketing executive : think it is the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight , and teletext disappears . but the subtitles stay there .
user interface designer : but if you push the teletext button twice
industrial designer : what if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? eight hundred eighty eight .
marketing executive : that is the case on most
user interface designer : it is one m one b , a few buttons .
project manager : that is not really that
marketing executive : that could be just like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : but then again that would be d j just not an option for older people ,
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : who do not even a scroll - wheel is . holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . with only five buttons on it . and a scroll - wheel .
project manager : if you make a good advertisement on television and in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . if you just make it real simple . because it saves a lot of money . and we can keep our l_c_d _ screen , which can provide extra information . how to use the scroll wheel . how to use the other bu buttons as subtitles .
marketing executive : true .
project manager : and it is good for the innovative design as . if you would erase these . and we put looks a bit odd maybe .
marketing executive : that is a pretty big scroll wheel .
project manager : that is something like that . we have got the scroll - wheel . one , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . and these are two buttons then .
industrial designer : we could make two buttons out of that . and just if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll - wheel . so that would save two buttons . if you do the same for the channel .
project manager : . that is really a good idea , . and it will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious .
industrial designer : more obvious .
project manager : so we make one for the volume , one for the channel .
industrial designer : if we
project manager : so we have got one , two , three . we can leave the teletext in if we want . that is m that is better .
marketing executive : so this is five buttons .
industrial designer : if we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat case . and make it smaller overall .
project manager : y .
industrial designer : so if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on - off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button
project manager : and then you can
industrial designer : you get a much smaller remote . and it sh
project manager : so we can decrease this one to four buttons .
industrial designer : ?
marketing executive : right now we have five .
user interface designer : but , you can make a f quite a big remote control for just the same price as a small one .
project manager : . that is no problem .
user interface designer : just you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . it it is a bit
project manager : it is it is more the moulds in which they are being made , . single curved is really easy to just fill in . and cases come right out of the machine . and single curved you have to have a different machine , than a flat one . this is a really easy one . , what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? freek , what do you think ?
marketing executive : i still think we should go for the single curve design . but then again , all these changes are not really with me .
industrial designer : richard is argument was very good .
marketing executive : but since we just have to .
project manager : we have to cut costs . i am ag
marketing executive : i would rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a remote .
project manager : ask for more money . i am agreeing with the usability .
marketing executive : or do some market research and see what the options are .
project manager : but th we can then keep the single curved one . just to express our l_c_d _ screen a bit more . so people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . it will be necessary to have good help function , as . this is scroll . it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . before we went on to the whole design .
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : the th
project manager : but i am glad we could make a bit . it is pretty different , if you saw the last one than this one .
marketing executive : it is pretty different . but this is not really like for the group we were making our remote .
user interface designer : no .
marketing executive : this will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell .
project manager : .
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : if older people like familiar forms and familiar . this is not familiar for them .
project manager : no ,
marketing executive : so we are gonna have to do a lotta convincing them .
project manager : the most
user interface designer : but they know the scroll - buttons from old radios . they cal also buttons like that for changing channels .
project manager : we can let l
user interface designer : so maybe it is
project manager : we can stick it out , a bit . like a old buttons . maybe that is recognisable for them as . that is a good one . i am afraid we have to move on . and it is b less frightening , . if they see this design they think , there are only five buttons , and but we will see .
marketing executive : that is true . might might be confusing too .
project manager : . that is definitely right .
user interface designer :  .
marketing executive : they would be like , what ? only five buttons ?
user interface designer : but very special ,
project manager : i would buy it .
marketing executive : but you are not sixty .
project manager : i would buy it if i was six . what it costs under twelve and a half euros ? , yes they are . but we can go on with the project evaluation . we still have fifteen minutes left , so we are on schedule . , the project process .
marketing executive : so , i like set up all these criteria . and evaluation of the thingy .
project manager : evaluation criteria . that was the point i forgot . i should there we are . evaluation criteria . we have got five minutes for those criteria .
marketing executive : five more minutes ?
project manager : no we have got fifteen minutes yes .
marketing executive : so i did some literature study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . translated it into criteria , which would be these . , is the remote fancy ? the shape , look and feel . what new functions are there ? , easy to use ? , learnability is a very important factor here . , is it functional ? are there not too many functions among the functions ? and are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? the target group . is the remote really for the group we are making it for ? and recognability . if our company is if it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? and so we are supposed to evaluate it right now . i have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting were not here .
project manager : that is because my pen failed to upload his data . i tried to
marketing executive : interesting .
project manager : but it is giving errors by downloading the software .
marketing executive : so is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ?
project manager : it is fancy .
industrial designer : six .
project manager : .
user interface designer : six .
marketing executive : we all go for six ? , is the design innovative ?
project manager : very .
user interface designer : . sh
marketing executive : so , with our l_c_d _ screen , docking station , scroll - buttons .
project manager : subtitles , buttons .
marketing executive : seven ?
project manager : so we have got twenty cents for our docking station , ?
marketing executive : should be do - able . is the design easy to use ?
user interface designer : .
project manager : that is a bit dodgy .
marketing executive : would be for us . but
user interface designer : for old people i
project manager : i would say four . four or five between . between four or five .
user interface designer : w
industrial designer : four or five .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : i would go for four , too .
project manager : is it functional ?
marketing executive : is the design functional ? , do we have all functions that we want to include ?
user interface designer : n
marketing executive : we do . do we have too many functions ? it is pretty slim .
project manager : think it is seven .
marketing executive : seven . and do we take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? like it getting lost and r_s_i _ influences ?
user interface designer : m
industrial designer : we have not thought of that one .
project manager : it was .
marketing executive : think we do .
project manager : i had them worked out . they are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost .
marketing executive : are the production costs within the preset limits ? does the design fit the group of focus ?
user interface designer : th .
industrial designer : that is a three .
project manager : with our new radio button , it is better .
marketing executive : it does not .
user interface designer : we have to test it s but
marketing executive : i .
industrial designer : i still it is too m too fancy . too too flashy .
project manager : it
marketing executive : a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control .
user interface designer : true .
project manager : i would give it a four .
marketing executive : i am not . i would go for two .
user interface designer : i go for three .
project manager : then we have to do the three . it is the
marketing executive : is the company recognisable ?
project manager : yes it is .
marketing executive : we have the logo there .
project manager : and they wanna put fashion in their products . in the slogan of the company . and we have the removable front cases . so , it is very recognisable .
marketing executive : so that will be this . i was also supposed to calculate the score , but thought we would have another private thingy after this .
project manager : we have got a calculate it .
industrial designer : twendag sieven an twendag .
marketing executive : is this like after this , are we done ? or
project manager : n we have gonna we are going to evaluate it .
marketing executive : we are gonna go to our other room again . these are seven factors times seven is forty something .
project manager : forty nine .
marketing executive : nine ? minus three , minus four . so that would be minus eight . forty one out of forty nine .
project manager : forty one . that is around eighty percent .
marketing executive : i will just type that in on the bottom here .
project manager : that is eighty four percent . that is a pretty score .
marketing executive : . so that will be the evaluation .
project manager : that brings us to the project evaluation . project process . did we move through the right phases , you think ? along the process ?
user interface designer : but it
marketing executive : think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . in the design phase .
project manager : so lack of information about prices .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : .
project manager : satisfaction . was there room for creativity ?
marketing executive : not too much .
project manager : it is because of the finance sheet .
industrial designer : there w there was enough room , but the finance
marketing executive : true .
project manager : the room was .
marketing executive : and i would have liked to go for the younger users also . and just to be able to access internet and get something of your own .
project manager : restrictions . internet access . was it clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions ? did it work out ? working together ? also , you two of you with the last phase ?
industrial designer : yes , was . the tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it is very easy .
project manager : tasks . were the means sufficient for the tasks we had to do ? or were they too much ?
industrial designer : the smart - board , the d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but the digital the digital pen is very .
project manager : smart - board . if it wants to download its data .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : failed download . smart - board was irritating . so you rather wanted to have a flip - over ?
industrial designer : a flip - over or a more precise digit
user interface designer : a flipper is easier ,
project manager : faster as , .
user interface designer : but if you want to share of when you make a picture like this on the presentation , it is easier to share it with other people . you can sh save it and put it on the internet , or in shared f folder or sh shared directory .
marketing executive : i tried to open the file on my laptop ,
user interface designer : no ?
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : but not possible .
project manager : you need a smart board application . but you can
user interface designer : t can you export it like a .
project manager : . should be possible . you can export it as image .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : must must be
marketing executive : should have done that then .
project manager : the sharing of the information was ?
marketing executive : pen is here .
project manager : network . , pen is here on the table .
user interface designer : you can
project manager : . it is possible .
user interface designer : it is possible .
project manager : have we found new ideas for having this meetings ? or
user interface designer : maybe when we n just give the numbers of o one of out of s sev it is easier to do the th things that are like that on a computer . , so just l like at u university
project manager : so . so everybody puts his own score . and then it mediates the score , and you can get one that is better . so that is how do we call ? evaluation criteria . , any more ideas ? or questions about the project ? or about the product ? because then that we get to our last sheet . are the costs within the budget ?
marketing executive : they are .
industrial designer : considering we are not going to make a docking station .
project manager : do we docking station . that is a good point . but maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ? and you can compensate that as .
industrial designer : perhaps .
project manager : so that should not be the biggest problem , because it is very cheap to make as .
industrial designer :  .
project manager : do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? or what was it ?
marketing executive : fifty grand .
project manager : fifteen fifteen million . if we gonna export this product . it is innovative . especially in america . people are pretty decadent .
marketing executive : still if we are n gonna make a scroll - button anyway it would be more for the younger people than for the older people .
project manager : you can do more .
marketing executive : so maybe we should just re - focus .
project manager : just put it on the market for everybody . you can you can change markets where by changing the front covers .
marketing executive : or specifically for younger people .
project manager : that is one thing you can change it with . so you can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy covers on the market . just as a test . see how it works . that is a good advantage .
marketing executive : then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . even if it were their covers .
project manager : then we can have our little celebration , right now .
marketing executive : party party .
project manager : we still have to fit in one more questionnaire .
user interface designer : where is the champagne ?
project manager : i . i did not get a message from the from ending of the
user interface designer : i believe y
project manager : i have one now .
marketing executive : you did .
project manager : five more minutes ? then we still have some questions . if somebody has some questions they can ask them now . or we can put these in the project folder as . maybe that is export as picture , . this is another network , i . does somebody see the project folder ?
user interface designer : maybe they will save it .
project manager : i will just put it in my documents
marketing executive : it probably will .
project manager : and i am going to make our final presentation now .
marketing executive : you are supposed to make a final
project manager : and then i will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . summary of the project .
marketing executive : are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ?
user interface designer : maybe we have to fill another questionnaire .
project manager : . questionnaire . you all get a questionnaire in your room . and then i will meet you in about ten minutes , . hopefully my pen will download its software .
marketing executive : that would be .",,"the marketing expert arrived late and the group started talking about their prototype presentation . they discussed the placement and design of the buttons , and suggested that the on-off button should be at the top of the device . the group evaluated the prototype based on its look and feel , usability , technological innovativeness , ease of use , its ability to control tv and video and its proximity to computers . after the project manager announced that the project would be terminated , the group discussed their final design and the costs of the remote , as well as the possibility to add more buttons to the remote but decided that it was not necessary to have an lcd screen , to have a help button for teletext , switch between channels , change the volume and the sub-left and the right-hand side with a small number buttons . all participants will fill out a questionnaire after they had discussed their initial ideas during the project process , they would like the remote to their computers and the corporate logo and the remote will not feature a scroll wheel . there will be no on- or in-time , but this would require a special button to change channel , in order to make the remote compatible with all television brands . this meeting was held at the end of the group decided that they would be free to spend all their final designs at one another . when they closed the meeting they will go home and will spend all of their final questions at the next meeting .",X,X,X,,,,,,5.0,T5-Cons
44,"project manager : so hello .
marketing executive : good afternoon . i am a little late .
project manager : no problem .
marketing executive : got stuck in the traffic .
project manager : that is possible on this time of day . starts at three o'clock . our fourth and last meeting . this our last meeting . in this meeting we will discuss our final design . and we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . and then we are going to close the project today as . after this you will be free to go and spend all your money . and this design , detailed design meeting we will discuss the look - and - feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . , in order to do that we have this agenda . we will have the prototype presentation first . then we will set up some evaluation cri criteria . then we will look at the finance . we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . so we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half euro per remote . but we will see that later . then we will do the project evaluation , and the closing after that . we have got forty minutes . so we will be finished at half past three . but first we will do the this is prototype presentation . so , if some if somebody wants step forward .
industrial designer : this is what me and richard came up with . the default spot for the on - off button . the mute button just below that . then there is the volume and channel selectors . simple plus - minus button . we thought of a help button . if you hold it and you press another button , the help goes to the l_c_d _ screen . then there is the zero to one to zero buttons . a button for teletext . a button for the subtitles . and the company logo . so it is rather simple prototype . and we will have to see from testing how the users take it .
marketing executive : is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ?
user interface designer : so .
industrial designer : just pop in at any time .
marketing executive : when you are in teletext there usually are buttons where you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page .
user interface designer : that is just the normal as th as the normal remote controls you put it you came in page one hundred . now you can use the normal one to zero buttons .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : and you but you can also use the button th for changing the channel . s so the shifting button . for shif shifting up in on t teletext , and shifting down . so
marketing executive : .
project manager : . but in a few meetings earlier we tried to keep it simple . just a few buttons and large buttons .
user interface designer : ?
project manager : but these are altogether quite a few buttons . so i am wondering if we neely really need all of those buttons .
industrial designer : if you look at most controls , they have got more buttons than this . and the on - off button , it is a necessity . you ca not drop that one . the volume and channel buttons , you need those . the mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume - down button twice . so we could cancel that one . the help button really is necessary because there is no other way to know when someone wants to a button does .
user interface designer : or you can build in when you press one button
project manager : long time . if you put
user interface designer : but m we disc discuss that already . but we think old people that option . so they just put in put press the button and
project manager : .
industrial designer : you ca not leave out the number buttons i .
user interface designer : and
project manager : teletext and subtitles are necessary .
industrial designer : so it is rather basic already .
marketing executive : that is what i pointed out earlier . if you just make a control for just the t_v _ there is just not much to gain here .
project manager : . so we had somebody about th interfa something about the design of the buttons there ?
industrial designer : they are
project manager : just n normal plain buttons .
user interface designer : . ,
industrial designer : it is rather hard to draw on the white - board .
user interface designer : it
industrial designer : but they are supposed to be equal sized , round , with a little logo on it for the volume , the triangle and .
user interface designer : just to recognise it , so
industrial designer : just for recognition .
user interface designer : and now we do not need leds or y
project manager : no .
user interface designer : s some remote controls do it also , but because we use the little display we do not have to use it .
industrial designer : so and for the materials we have just chosen for rubber buttons . with a different colour than the case .
user interface designer : nay .
industrial designer : so they jump out . and that is about it .
project manager : that is . then because we only have thirty minutes left , i will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it is all possible what we wanna do . and tell you that we are going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half euros . if we see i if i have filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see something wrong . i counted two batteries . but maybe we can also use one . i if it is possible .
marketing executive : since it rechargeable .
project manager : it is rechargeable .
user interface designer : we can u just
project manager : that is two euros off . we need the advanced chip . so there is not much to save there . here we have the single curves . we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one euro . , i , but the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . we have to keep that .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : then we have the case material supplements . it is plastic . it is the cheapest one we need . so that is not much to save either . but then the biggest costs are the buttons . so maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our costs low . because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half euros at the end . , so if we let is fir first count the buttons we have now .
user interface designer : sixteen , i believe so .
project manager : because i sixteen . nah , that will be even more then . eighteen euros .
user interface designer : seventeen . with the help button .
project manager : seventeen . , including the help ?
marketing executive : damn .
project manager : . we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a number long . that saves us one euro already . then we have got fifteen ?
marketing executive : would not
project manager : fifteen buttons .
marketing executive : no . that would not be an option .
project manager : and this is
marketing executive : d i assume you would count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ?
project manager : no those are one , .
user interface designer : where did
marketing executive : think actually there are two buttons ,
user interface designer : it is just one button .
marketing executive : are not they ?
user interface designer : but , . there were two for one big button . but they are more expensive than the small ones . so
project manager : but th it is not stated in this files .
user interface designer : it is just a .
project manager : so maybe we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing
marketing executive : i was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button .
project manager : that is possibility as .
marketing executive : that would cut the cost .
project manager : and it is good for the design as . so you can make let is see . if you make this looks a bit like a cross .
user interface designer : but i if it is cheaper .
project manager : s channel .
user interface designer : so ,
project manager : w
user interface designer : we have still got four buttons , but just so
project manager : th they count the materials .
user interface designer : you got not a butt button itself , but on the
project manager : on the chip there .
user interface designer : on the chip you have got still four buttons .
project manager : but because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button .
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : but , this really is four buttons anyhow .
project manager : but no but . maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it is impossible to get the twelve and a half euros . also the l_c _ display , it is too expensive for the display we use .
marketing executive : yes .
industrial designer : that is a big cost .
project manager : they try t
industrial designer : if we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip .
project manager : but what is the big advantage of our remote then ?
marketing executive : only the docking station , i .
industrial designer : which is not the docking station is not even in this c s schematic . it is not even taken into the price .
project manager : that is extra .
marketing executive : maybe we should to a different supplier .
project manager : that is an option . polish supplier . do not you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as .
industrial designer : we we could save money on it . but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ?
marketing executive : that is what i am wondering .
industrial designer : my mother ca not even send an s_m_s _ message .
project manager : . that is a point .
user interface designer : are we gonna buy a remote control when you can use it ? we m we must stay below the below twelve fifty or ca not go
marketing executive : since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it is feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . especially since we have those features .
project manager : but we have to stick to the twelve and a half euros . we do not have any more budget to develop it .
user interface designer : is it impossible to
industrial designer : the margin will get too small .
user interface designer : but it is possible to make one for twelve fifty .
project manager : it is . if you leave out the l_c _ display . and if you use less buttons . say or you can take the single chip .
user interface designer : i do not .
marketing executive : it would be a pretty rigid one .
user interface designer : s but , you ca not use
industrial designer : ten .
project manager : there it is . but then w good looking .
user interface designer : wi with n , with attractive o options . you can stay below twelve fifty .
project manager : it is difficult as ,
marketing executive : or b becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control .
industrial designer : no remote .
project manager : or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . then w
user interface designer : scroll - wheel is one .
industrial designer : that is
project manager : because then we save ten buttons .
user interface designer : no ,
project manager : then we have five and one . if we have this one and we have got the advanced w , we are getting close .
industrial designer : we are getting closer .
marketing executive : but how does scroll - wheel work here ?
project manager : then you will or maybe you can scroll . if you scroll you will see the numbers on the l_c_d _ display . until you have got the right number , then you push it .
marketing executive : that would bring up the price of the scroll - wheel also . integrated scroll - wheel push - button .
project manager : alright . it is got ta scroll and push . but then you can push some other button as .
marketing executive : but .
industrial designer : you could just not scroll for a half a second .
project manager : . so if you scroll to a number and then you a half second , then it g turns to that channel .
industrial designer : so you wo not need a button .
marketing executive : that would be like the end of our usability .
project manager : but it would definitely crop cost , a lot .
user interface designer : d
marketing executive : but
project manager : and we need the battery . and the regular chip is not possible ? it has to be advanced ?
industrial designer : if you want to use an l_c_d _ screen you need an advanced chip , yes .
project manager : it has to be advanced . and we can save a euro by a flat design . that is an option we can
user interface designer : ja ja .
project manager : then we are almost there .
industrial designer : if you v could just leave out one more button .
project manager : if we
user interface designer : or we have to skip the subtitle button .
project manager : but that is that is a big advantage , if we are
user interface designer : it is a big advantage . but , it is
project manager : can we use ca not we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : so .
project manager : if you push it three times ?
marketing executive : think it is the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight , and teletext disappears . but the subtitles stay there .
user interface designer : but if you push the teletext button twice
industrial designer : what if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? eight hundred eighty eight .
marketing executive : that is the case on most
user interface designer : it is one m one b , a few buttons .
project manager : that is not really that
marketing executive : that could be just like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : but then again that would be d j just not an option for older people ,
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : who do not even a scroll - wheel is . holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . with only five buttons on it . and a scroll - wheel .
project manager : if you make a good advertisement on television and in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . if you just make it real simple . because it saves a lot of money . and we can keep our l_c_d _ screen , which can provide extra information . how to use the scroll wheel . how to use the other bu buttons as subtitles .
marketing executive : true .
project manager : and it is good for the innovative design as . if you would erase these . and we put looks a bit odd maybe .
marketing executive : that is a pretty big scroll wheel .
project manager : that is something like that . we have got the scroll - wheel . one , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . and these are two buttons then .
industrial designer : we could make two buttons out of that . and just if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll - wheel . so that would save two buttons . if you do the same for the channel .
project manager : . that is really a good idea , . and it will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious .
industrial designer : more obvious .
project manager : so we make one for the volume , one for the channel .
industrial designer : if we
project manager : so we have got one , two , three . we can leave the teletext in if we want . that is m that is better .
marketing executive : so this is five buttons .
industrial designer : if we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat case . and make it smaller overall .
project manager : y .
industrial designer : so if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on - off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button
project manager : and then you can
industrial designer : you get a much smaller remote . and it sh
project manager : so we can decrease this one to four buttons .
industrial designer : ?
marketing executive : right now we have five .
user interface designer : but , you can make a f quite a big remote control for just the same price as a small one .
project manager : . that is no problem .
user interface designer : just you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . it it is a bit
project manager : it is it is more the moulds in which they are being made , . single curved is really easy to just fill in . and cases come right out of the machine . and single curved you have to have a different machine , than a flat one . this is a really easy one . , what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? freek , what do you think ?
marketing executive : i still think we should go for the single curve design . but then again , all these changes are not really with me .
industrial designer : richard is argument was very good .
marketing executive : but since we just have to .
project manager : we have to cut costs . i am ag
marketing executive : i would rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a remote .
project manager : ask for more money . i am agreeing with the usability .
marketing executive : or do some market research and see what the options are .
project manager : but th we can then keep the single curved one . just to express our l_c_d _ screen a bit more . so people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . it will be necessary to have good help function , as . this is scroll . it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . before we went on to the whole design .
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : the th
project manager : but i am glad we could make a bit . it is pretty different , if you saw the last one than this one .
marketing executive : it is pretty different . but this is not really like for the group we were making our remote .
user interface designer : no .
marketing executive : this will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell .
project manager : .
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : if older people like familiar forms and familiar . this is not familiar for them .
project manager : no ,
marketing executive : so we are gonna have to do a lotta convincing them .
project manager : the most
user interface designer : but they know the scroll - buttons from old radios . they cal also buttons like that for changing channels .
project manager : we can let l
user interface designer : so maybe it is
project manager : we can stick it out , a bit . like a old buttons . maybe that is recognisable for them as . that is a good one . i am afraid we have to move on . and it is b less frightening , . if they see this design they think , there are only five buttons , and but we will see .
marketing executive : that is true . might might be confusing too .
project manager : . that is definitely right .
user interface designer :  .
marketing executive : they would be like , what ? only five buttons ?
user interface designer : but very special ,
project manager : i would buy it .
marketing executive : but you are not sixty .
project manager : i would buy it if i was six . what it costs under twelve and a half euros ? , yes they are . but we can go on with the project evaluation . we still have fifteen minutes left , so we are on schedule . , the project process .
marketing executive : so , i like set up all these criteria . and evaluation of the thingy .
project manager : evaluation criteria . that was the point i forgot . i should there we are . evaluation criteria . we have got five minutes for those criteria .
marketing executive : five more minutes ?
project manager : no we have got fifteen minutes yes .
marketing executive : so i did some literature study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . translated it into criteria , which would be these . , is the remote fancy ? the shape , look and feel . what new functions are there ? , easy to use ? , learnability is a very important factor here . , is it functional ? are there not too many functions among the functions ? and are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? the target group . is the remote really for the group we are making it for ? and recognability . if our company is if it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? and so we are supposed to evaluate it right now . i have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting were not here .
project manager : that is because my pen failed to upload his data . i tried to
marketing executive : interesting .
project manager : but it is giving errors by downloading the software .
marketing executive : so is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ?
project manager : it is fancy .
industrial designer : six .
project manager : .
user interface designer : six .
marketing executive : we all go for six ? , is the design innovative ?
project manager : very .
user interface designer : . sh
marketing executive : so , with our l_c_d _ screen , docking station , scroll - buttons .
project manager : subtitles , buttons .
marketing executive : seven ?
project manager : so we have got twenty cents for our docking station , ?
marketing executive : should be do - able . is the design easy to use ?
user interface designer : .
project manager : that is a bit dodgy .
marketing executive : would be for us . but
user interface designer : for old people i
project manager : i would say four . four or five between . between four or five .
user interface designer : w
industrial designer : four or five .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : i would go for four , too .
project manager : is it functional ?
marketing executive : is the design functional ? , do we have all functions that we want to include ?
user interface designer : n
marketing executive : we do . do we have too many functions ? it is pretty slim .
project manager : think it is seven .
marketing executive : seven . and do we take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? like it getting lost and r_s_i _ influences ?
user interface designer : m
industrial designer : we have not thought of that one .
project manager : it was .
marketing executive : think we do .
project manager : i had them worked out . they are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost .
marketing executive : are the production costs within the preset limits ? does the design fit the group of focus ?
user interface designer : th .
industrial designer : that is a three .
project manager : with our new radio button , it is better .
marketing executive : it does not .
user interface designer : we have to test it s but
marketing executive : i .
industrial designer : i still it is too m too fancy . too too flashy .
project manager : it
marketing executive : a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control .
user interface designer : true .
project manager : i would give it a four .
marketing executive : i am not . i would go for two .
user interface designer : i go for three .
project manager : then we have to do the three . it is the
marketing executive : is the company recognisable ?
project manager : yes it is .
marketing executive : we have the logo there .
project manager : and they wanna put fashion in their products . in the slogan of the company . and we have the removable front cases . so , it is very recognisable .
marketing executive : so that will be this . i was also supposed to calculate the score , but thought we would have another private thingy after this .
project manager : we have got a calculate it .
industrial designer : twendag sieven an twendag .
marketing executive : is this like after this , are we done ? or
project manager : n we have gonna we are going to evaluate it .
marketing executive : we are gonna go to our other room again . these are seven factors times seven is forty something .
project manager : forty nine .
marketing executive : nine ? minus three , minus four . so that would be minus eight . forty one out of forty nine .
project manager : forty one . that is around eighty percent .
marketing executive : i will just type that in on the bottom here .
project manager : that is eighty four percent . that is a pretty score .
marketing executive : . so that will be the evaluation .
project manager : that brings us to the project evaluation . project process . did we move through the right phases , you think ? along the process ?
user interface designer : but it
marketing executive : think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . in the design phase .
project manager : so lack of information about prices .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : .
project manager : satisfaction . was there room for creativity ?
marketing executive : not too much .
project manager : it is because of the finance sheet .
industrial designer : there w there was enough room , but the finance
marketing executive : true .
project manager : the room was .
marketing executive : and i would have liked to go for the younger users also . and just to be able to access internet and get something of your own .
project manager : restrictions . internet access . was it clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions ? did it work out ? working together ? also , you two of you with the last phase ?
industrial designer : yes , was . the tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it is very easy .
project manager : tasks . were the means sufficient for the tasks we had to do ? or were they too much ?
industrial designer : the smart - board , the d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but the digital the digital pen is very .
project manager : smart - board . if it wants to download its data .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : failed download . smart - board was irritating . so you rather wanted to have a flip - over ?
industrial designer : a flip - over or a more precise digit
user interface designer : a flipper is easier ,
project manager : faster as , .
user interface designer : but if you want to share of when you make a picture like this on the presentation , it is easier to share it with other people . you can sh save it and put it on the internet , or in shared f folder or sh shared directory .
marketing executive : i tried to open the file on my laptop ,
user interface designer : no ?
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : but not possible .
project manager : you need a smart board application . but you can
user interface designer : t can you export it like a .
project manager : . should be possible . you can export it as image .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : must must be
marketing executive : should have done that then .
project manager : the sharing of the information was ?
marketing executive : pen is here .
project manager : network . , pen is here on the table .
user interface designer : you can
project manager : . it is possible .
user interface designer : it is possible .
project manager : have we found new ideas for having this meetings ? or
user interface designer : maybe when we n just give the numbers of o one of out of s sev it is easier to do the th things that are like that on a computer . , so just l like at u university
project manager : so . so everybody puts his own score . and then it mediates the score , and you can get one that is better . so that is how do we call ? evaluation criteria . , any more ideas ? or questions about the project ? or about the product ? because then that we get to our last sheet . are the costs within the budget ?
marketing executive : they are .
industrial designer : considering we are not going to make a docking station .
project manager : do we docking station . that is a good point . but maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ? and you can compensate that as .
industrial designer : perhaps .
project manager : so that should not be the biggest problem , because it is very cheap to make as .
industrial designer :  .
project manager : do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? or what was it ?
marketing executive : fifty grand .
project manager : fifteen fifteen million . if we gonna export this product . it is innovative . especially in america . people are pretty decadent .
marketing executive : still if we are n gonna make a scroll - button anyway it would be more for the younger people than for the older people .
project manager : you can do more .
marketing executive : so maybe we should just re - focus .
project manager : just put it on the market for everybody . you can you can change markets where by changing the front covers .
marketing executive : or specifically for younger people .
project manager : that is one thing you can change it with . so you can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy covers on the market . just as a test . see how it works . that is a good advantage .
marketing executive : then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . even if it were their covers .
project manager : then we can have our little celebration , right now .
marketing executive : party party .
project manager : we still have to fit in one more questionnaire .
user interface designer : where is the champagne ?
project manager : i . i did not get a message from the from ending of the
user interface designer : i believe y
project manager : i have one now .
marketing executive : you did .
project manager : five more minutes ? then we still have some questions . if somebody has some questions they can ask them now . or we can put these in the project folder as . maybe that is export as picture , . this is another network , i . does somebody see the project folder ?
user interface designer : maybe they will save it .
project manager : i will just put it in my documents
marketing executive : it probably will .
project manager : and i am going to make our final presentation now .
marketing executive : you are supposed to make a final
project manager : and then i will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . summary of the project .
marketing executive : are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ?
user interface designer : maybe we have to fill another questionnaire .
project manager : . questionnaire . you all get a questionnaire in your room . and then i will meet you in about ten minutes , . hopefully my pen will download its software .
marketing executive : that would be .",,"the project manager opens the meeting by stating that they will close the project at 4:00 pm . the designers present the prototype , which resembles a normal remote in appearance , with only a few buttons . they point out that the volume and channel buttons are normal , and that there is only one extra button for teletext . the marketing expert administers the product evaluation , and they rate the product on the basis of its appearance , technological innovation , ease of use , and its ability to be misplaced . they rate the product using a 7 point scale and come up with an average score of 6.5. the group goes on to calculate the production cost and finds they are over the budget , so they ask to borrow some money from their own pockets . they have discussion and decide to eliminate the sample speaker locator and the scroll wheel in order to keep the price point of the device close to the original . the group goes on to calculate the profit aim and find they are over the budget , so they ask to borrow some money from their own pockets . the project manager administers the product evaluation , and they rate the product using a 7 point scale and come up with an average score of 6.5. they have discussion and decide to eliminate the sample speaker locator and the scroll wheel in order to keep the price point of the device close to the original . the group goes on to calculate the profit aim and find they are over the budget , so",X,X,,,X,,X,,6.0,Pegasus-Cons
45,"project manager : so hello .
marketing executive : good afternoon . i am a little late .
project manager : no problem .
marketing executive : got stuck in the traffic .
project manager : that is possible on this time of day . starts at three o'clock . our fourth and last meeting . this our last meeting . in this meeting we will discuss our final design . and we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . and then we are going to close the project today as . after this you will be free to go and spend all your money . and this design , detailed design meeting we will discuss the look - and - feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . , in order to do that we have this agenda . we will have the prototype presentation first . then we will set up some evaluation cri criteria . then we will look at the finance . we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . so we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half euro per remote . but we will see that later . then we will do the project evaluation , and the closing after that . we have got forty minutes . so we will be finished at half past three . but first we will do the this is prototype presentation . so , if some if somebody wants step forward .
industrial designer : this is what me and richard came up with . the default spot for the on - off button . the mute button just below that . then there is the volume and channel selectors . simple plus - minus button . we thought of a help button . if you hold it and you press another button , the help goes to the l_c_d _ screen . then there is the zero to one to zero buttons . a button for teletext . a button for the subtitles . and the company logo . so it is rather simple prototype . and we will have to see from testing how the users take it .
marketing executive : is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ?
user interface designer : so .
industrial designer : just pop in at any time .
marketing executive : when you are in teletext there usually are buttons where you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page .
user interface designer : that is just the normal as th as the normal remote controls you put it you came in page one hundred . now you can use the normal one to zero buttons .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : and you but you can also use the button th for changing the channel . s so the shifting button . for shif shifting up in on t teletext , and shifting down . so
marketing executive : .
project manager : . but in a few meetings earlier we tried to keep it simple . just a few buttons and large buttons .
user interface designer : ?
project manager : but these are altogether quite a few buttons . so i am wondering if we neely really need all of those buttons .
industrial designer : if you look at most controls , they have got more buttons than this . and the on - off button , it is a necessity . you ca not drop that one . the volume and channel buttons , you need those . the mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume - down button twice . so we could cancel that one . the help button really is necessary because there is no other way to know when someone wants to a button does .
user interface designer : or you can build in when you press one button
project manager : long time . if you put
user interface designer : but m we disc discuss that already . but we think old people that option . so they just put in put press the button and
project manager : .
industrial designer : you ca not leave out the number buttons i .
user interface designer : and
project manager : teletext and subtitles are necessary .
industrial designer : so it is rather basic already .
marketing executive : that is what i pointed out earlier . if you just make a control for just the t_v _ there is just not much to gain here .
project manager : . so we had somebody about th interfa something about the design of the buttons there ?
industrial designer : they are
project manager : just n normal plain buttons .
user interface designer : . ,
industrial designer : it is rather hard to draw on the white - board .
user interface designer : it
industrial designer : but they are supposed to be equal sized , round , with a little logo on it for the volume , the triangle and .
user interface designer : just to recognise it , so
industrial designer : just for recognition .
user interface designer : and now we do not need leds or y
project manager : no .
user interface designer : s some remote controls do it also , but because we use the little display we do not have to use it .
industrial designer : so and for the materials we have just chosen for rubber buttons . with a different colour than the case .
user interface designer : nay .
industrial designer : so they jump out . and that is about it .
project manager : that is . then because we only have thirty minutes left , i will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it is all possible what we wanna do . and tell you that we are going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half euros . if we see i if i have filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see something wrong . i counted two batteries . but maybe we can also use one . i if it is possible .
marketing executive : since it rechargeable .
project manager : it is rechargeable .
user interface designer : we can u just
project manager : that is two euros off . we need the advanced chip . so there is not much to save there . here we have the single curves . we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one euro . , i , but the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . we have to keep that .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : then we have the case material supplements . it is plastic . it is the cheapest one we need . so that is not much to save either . but then the biggest costs are the buttons . so maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our costs low . because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half euros at the end . , so if we let is fir first count the buttons we have now .
user interface designer : sixteen , i believe so .
project manager : because i sixteen . nah , that will be even more then . eighteen euros .
user interface designer : seventeen . with the help button .
project manager : seventeen . , including the help ?
marketing executive : damn .
project manager : . we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a number long . that saves us one euro already . then we have got fifteen ?
marketing executive : would not
project manager : fifteen buttons .
marketing executive : no . that would not be an option .
project manager : and this is
marketing executive : d i assume you would count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ?
project manager : no those are one , .
user interface designer : where did
marketing executive : think actually there are two buttons ,
user interface designer : it is just one button .
marketing executive : are not they ?
user interface designer : but , . there were two for one big button . but they are more expensive than the small ones . so
project manager : but th it is not stated in this files .
user interface designer : it is just a .
project manager : so maybe we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing
marketing executive : i was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button .
project manager : that is possibility as .
marketing executive : that would cut the cost .
project manager : and it is good for the design as . so you can make let is see . if you make this looks a bit like a cross .
user interface designer : but i if it is cheaper .
project manager : s channel .
user interface designer : so ,
project manager : w
user interface designer : we have still got four buttons , but just so
project manager : th they count the materials .
user interface designer : you got not a butt button itself , but on the
project manager : on the chip there .
user interface designer : on the chip you have got still four buttons .
project manager : but because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button .
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : but , this really is four buttons anyhow .
project manager : but no but . maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it is impossible to get the twelve and a half euros . also the l_c _ display , it is too expensive for the display we use .
marketing executive : yes .
industrial designer : that is a big cost .
project manager : they try t
industrial designer : if we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip .
project manager : but what is the big advantage of our remote then ?
marketing executive : only the docking station , i .
industrial designer : which is not the docking station is not even in this c s schematic . it is not even taken into the price .
project manager : that is extra .
marketing executive : maybe we should to a different supplier .
project manager : that is an option . polish supplier . do not you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as .
industrial designer : we we could save money on it . but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ?
marketing executive : that is what i am wondering .
industrial designer : my mother ca not even send an s_m_s _ message .
project manager : . that is a point .
user interface designer : are we gonna buy a remote control when you can use it ? we m we must stay below the below twelve fifty or ca not go
marketing executive : since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it is feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . especially since we have those features .
project manager : but we have to stick to the twelve and a half euros . we do not have any more budget to develop it .
user interface designer : is it impossible to
industrial designer : the margin will get too small .
user interface designer : but it is possible to make one for twelve fifty .
project manager : it is . if you leave out the l_c _ display . and if you use less buttons . say or you can take the single chip .
user interface designer : i do not .
marketing executive : it would be a pretty rigid one .
user interface designer : s but , you ca not use
industrial designer : ten .
project manager : there it is . but then w good looking .
user interface designer : wi with n , with attractive o options . you can stay below twelve fifty .
project manager : it is difficult as ,
marketing executive : or b becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control .
industrial designer : no remote .
project manager : or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . then w
user interface designer : scroll - wheel is one .
industrial designer : that is
project manager : because then we save ten buttons .
user interface designer : no ,
project manager : then we have five and one . if we have this one and we have got the advanced w , we are getting close .
industrial designer : we are getting closer .
marketing executive : but how does scroll - wheel work here ?
project manager : then you will or maybe you can scroll . if you scroll you will see the numbers on the l_c_d _ display . until you have got the right number , then you push it .
marketing executive : that would bring up the price of the scroll - wheel also . integrated scroll - wheel push - button .
project manager : alright . it is got ta scroll and push . but then you can push some other button as .
marketing executive : but .
industrial designer : you could just not scroll for a half a second .
project manager : . so if you scroll to a number and then you a half second , then it g turns to that channel .
industrial designer : so you wo not need a button .
marketing executive : that would be like the end of our usability .
project manager : but it would definitely crop cost , a lot .
user interface designer : d
marketing executive : but
project manager : and we need the battery . and the regular chip is not possible ? it has to be advanced ?
industrial designer : if you want to use an l_c_d _ screen you need an advanced chip , yes .
project manager : it has to be advanced . and we can save a euro by a flat design . that is an option we can
user interface designer : ja ja .
project manager : then we are almost there .
industrial designer : if you v could just leave out one more button .
project manager : if we
user interface designer : or we have to skip the subtitle button .
project manager : but that is that is a big advantage , if we are
user interface designer : it is a big advantage . but , it is
project manager : can we use ca not we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : so .
project manager : if you push it three times ?
marketing executive : think it is the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight , and teletext disappears . but the subtitles stay there .
user interface designer : but if you push the teletext button twice
industrial designer : what if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? eight hundred eighty eight .
marketing executive : that is the case on most
user interface designer : it is one m one b , a few buttons .
project manager : that is not really that
marketing executive : that could be just like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : but then again that would be d j just not an option for older people ,
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : who do not even a scroll - wheel is . holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . with only five buttons on it . and a scroll - wheel .
project manager : if you make a good advertisement on television and in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . if you just make it real simple . because it saves a lot of money . and we can keep our l_c_d _ screen , which can provide extra information . how to use the scroll wheel . how to use the other bu buttons as subtitles .
marketing executive : true .
project manager : and it is good for the innovative design as . if you would erase these . and we put looks a bit odd maybe .
marketing executive : that is a pretty big scroll wheel .
project manager : that is something like that . we have got the scroll - wheel . one , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . and these are two buttons then .
industrial designer : we could make two buttons out of that . and just if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll - wheel . so that would save two buttons . if you do the same for the channel .
project manager : . that is really a good idea , . and it will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious .
industrial designer : more obvious .
project manager : so we make one for the volume , one for the channel .
industrial designer : if we
project manager : so we have got one , two , three . we can leave the teletext in if we want . that is m that is better .
marketing executive : so this is five buttons .
industrial designer : if we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat case . and make it smaller overall .
project manager : y .
industrial designer : so if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on - off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button
project manager : and then you can
industrial designer : you get a much smaller remote . and it sh
project manager : so we can decrease this one to four buttons .
industrial designer : ?
marketing executive : right now we have five .
user interface designer : but , you can make a f quite a big remote control for just the same price as a small one .
project manager : . that is no problem .
user interface designer : just you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . it it is a bit
project manager : it is it is more the moulds in which they are being made , . single curved is really easy to just fill in . and cases come right out of the machine . and single curved you have to have a different machine , than a flat one . this is a really easy one . , what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? freek , what do you think ?
marketing executive : i still think we should go for the single curve design . but then again , all these changes are not really with me .
industrial designer : richard is argument was very good .
marketing executive : but since we just have to .
project manager : we have to cut costs . i am ag
marketing executive : i would rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a remote .
project manager : ask for more money . i am agreeing with the usability .
marketing executive : or do some market research and see what the options are .
project manager : but th we can then keep the single curved one . just to express our l_c_d _ screen a bit more . so people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . it will be necessary to have good help function , as . this is scroll . it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . before we went on to the whole design .
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : the th
project manager : but i am glad we could make a bit . it is pretty different , if you saw the last one than this one .
marketing executive : it is pretty different . but this is not really like for the group we were making our remote .
user interface designer : no .
marketing executive : this will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell .
project manager : .
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : if older people like familiar forms and familiar . this is not familiar for them .
project manager : no ,
marketing executive : so we are gonna have to do a lotta convincing them .
project manager : the most
user interface designer : but they know the scroll - buttons from old radios . they cal also buttons like that for changing channels .
project manager : we can let l
user interface designer : so maybe it is
project manager : we can stick it out , a bit . like a old buttons . maybe that is recognisable for them as . that is a good one . i am afraid we have to move on . and it is b less frightening , . if they see this design they think , there are only five buttons , and but we will see .
marketing executive : that is true . might might be confusing too .
project manager : . that is definitely right .
user interface designer :  .
marketing executive : they would be like , what ? only five buttons ?
user interface designer : but very special ,
project manager : i would buy it .
marketing executive : but you are not sixty .
project manager : i would buy it if i was six . what it costs under twelve and a half euros ? , yes they are . but we can go on with the project evaluation . we still have fifteen minutes left , so we are on schedule . , the project process .
marketing executive : so , i like set up all these criteria . and evaluation of the thingy .
project manager : evaluation criteria . that was the point i forgot . i should there we are . evaluation criteria . we have got five minutes for those criteria .
marketing executive : five more minutes ?
project manager : no we have got fifteen minutes yes .
marketing executive : so i did some literature study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . translated it into criteria , which would be these . , is the remote fancy ? the shape , look and feel . what new functions are there ? , easy to use ? , learnability is a very important factor here . , is it functional ? are there not too many functions among the functions ? and are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? the target group . is the remote really for the group we are making it for ? and recognability . if our company is if it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? and so we are supposed to evaluate it right now . i have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting were not here .
project manager : that is because my pen failed to upload his data . i tried to
marketing executive : interesting .
project manager : but it is giving errors by downloading the software .
marketing executive : so is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ?
project manager : it is fancy .
industrial designer : six .
project manager : .
user interface designer : six .
marketing executive : we all go for six ? , is the design innovative ?
project manager : very .
user interface designer : . sh
marketing executive : so , with our l_c_d _ screen , docking station , scroll - buttons .
project manager : subtitles , buttons .
marketing executive : seven ?
project manager : so we have got twenty cents for our docking station , ?
marketing executive : should be do - able . is the design easy to use ?
user interface designer : .
project manager : that is a bit dodgy .
marketing executive : would be for us . but
user interface designer : for old people i
project manager : i would say four . four or five between . between four or five .
user interface designer : w
industrial designer : four or five .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : i would go for four , too .
project manager : is it functional ?
marketing executive : is the design functional ? , do we have all functions that we want to include ?
user interface designer : n
marketing executive : we do . do we have too many functions ? it is pretty slim .
project manager : think it is seven .
marketing executive : seven . and do we take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? like it getting lost and r_s_i _ influences ?
user interface designer : m
industrial designer : we have not thought of that one .
project manager : it was .
marketing executive : think we do .
project manager : i had them worked out . they are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost .
marketing executive : are the production costs within the preset limits ? does the design fit the group of focus ?
user interface designer : th .
industrial designer : that is a three .
project manager : with our new radio button , it is better .
marketing executive : it does not .
user interface designer : we have to test it s but
marketing executive : i .
industrial designer : i still it is too m too fancy . too too flashy .
project manager : it
marketing executive : a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control .
user interface designer : true .
project manager : i would give it a four .
marketing executive : i am not . i would go for two .
user interface designer : i go for three .
project manager : then we have to do the three . it is the
marketing executive : is the company recognisable ?
project manager : yes it is .
marketing executive : we have the logo there .
project manager : and they wanna put fashion in their products . in the slogan of the company . and we have the removable front cases . so , it is very recognisable .
marketing executive : so that will be this . i was also supposed to calculate the score , but thought we would have another private thingy after this .
project manager : we have got a calculate it .
industrial designer : twendag sieven an twendag .
marketing executive : is this like after this , are we done ? or
project manager : n we have gonna we are going to evaluate it .
marketing executive : we are gonna go to our other room again . these are seven factors times seven is forty something .
project manager : forty nine .
marketing executive : nine ? minus three , minus four . so that would be minus eight . forty one out of forty nine .
project manager : forty one . that is around eighty percent .
marketing executive : i will just type that in on the bottom here .
project manager : that is eighty four percent . that is a pretty score .
marketing executive : . so that will be the evaluation .
project manager : that brings us to the project evaluation . project process . did we move through the right phases , you think ? along the process ?
user interface designer : but it
marketing executive : think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . in the design phase .
project manager : so lack of information about prices .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : .
project manager : satisfaction . was there room for creativity ?
marketing executive : not too much .
project manager : it is because of the finance sheet .
industrial designer : there w there was enough room , but the finance
marketing executive : true .
project manager : the room was .
marketing executive : and i would have liked to go for the younger users also . and just to be able to access internet and get something of your own .
project manager : restrictions . internet access . was it clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions ? did it work out ? working together ? also , you two of you with the last phase ?
industrial designer : yes , was . the tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it is very easy .
project manager : tasks . were the means sufficient for the tasks we had to do ? or were they too much ?
industrial designer : the smart - board , the d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but the digital the digital pen is very .
project manager : smart - board . if it wants to download its data .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : failed download . smart - board was irritating . so you rather wanted to have a flip - over ?
industrial designer : a flip - over or a more precise digit
user interface designer : a flipper is easier ,
project manager : faster as , .
user interface designer : but if you want to share of when you make a picture like this on the presentation , it is easier to share it with other people . you can sh save it and put it on the internet , or in shared f folder or sh shared directory .
marketing executive : i tried to open the file on my laptop ,
user interface designer : no ?
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : but not possible .
project manager : you need a smart board application . but you can
user interface designer : t can you export it like a .
project manager : . should be possible . you can export it as image .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : must must be
marketing executive : should have done that then .
project manager : the sharing of the information was ?
marketing executive : pen is here .
project manager : network . , pen is here on the table .
user interface designer : you can
project manager : . it is possible .
user interface designer : it is possible .
project manager : have we found new ideas for having this meetings ? or
user interface designer : maybe when we n just give the numbers of o one of out of s sev it is easier to do the th things that are like that on a computer . , so just l like at u university
project manager : so . so everybody puts his own score . and then it mediates the score , and you can get one that is better . so that is how do we call ? evaluation criteria . , any more ideas ? or questions about the project ? or about the product ? because then that we get to our last sheet . are the costs within the budget ?
marketing executive : they are .
industrial designer : considering we are not going to make a docking station .
project manager : do we docking station . that is a good point . but maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ? and you can compensate that as .
industrial designer : perhaps .
project manager : so that should not be the biggest problem , because it is very cheap to make as .
industrial designer :  .
project manager : do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? or what was it ?
marketing executive : fifty grand .
project manager : fifteen fifteen million . if we gonna export this product . it is innovative . especially in america . people are pretty decadent .
marketing executive : still if we are n gonna make a scroll - button anyway it would be more for the younger people than for the older people .
project manager : you can do more .
marketing executive : so maybe we should just re - focus .
project manager : just put it on the market for everybody . you can you can change markets where by changing the front covers .
marketing executive : or specifically for younger people .
project manager : that is one thing you can change it with . so you can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy covers on the market . just as a test . see how it works . that is a good advantage .
marketing executive : then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . even if it were their covers .
project manager : then we can have our little celebration , right now .
marketing executive : party party .
project manager : we still have to fit in one more questionnaire .
user interface designer : where is the champagne ?
project manager : i . i did not get a message from the from ending of the
user interface designer : i believe y
project manager : i have one now .
marketing executive : you did .
project manager : five more minutes ? then we still have some questions . if somebody has some questions they can ask them now . or we can put these in the project folder as . maybe that is export as picture , . this is another network , i . does somebody see the project folder ?
user interface designer : maybe they will save it .
project manager : i will just put it in my documents
marketing executive : it probably will .
project manager : and i am going to make our final presentation now .
marketing executive : you are supposed to make a final
project manager : and then i will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . summary of the project .
marketing executive : are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ?
user interface designer : maybe we have to fill another questionnaire .
project manager : . questionnaire . you all get a questionnaire in your room . and then i will meet you in about ten minutes , . hopefully my pen will download its software .
marketing executive : that would be .",,"the marketing expert arrived late because he was stuck in traffic . the user interface designer and industrial designer presented the prototype of the remote they were to create and discussed its look and feel , usability , and functional design . they discussed adding teletext and subtitles to the remote . after the prototype presentation , the group discussed their initial ideas about the interface design and the number of buttons they wanted to add . then the project manager discussed the project finances and whether the project fit within the twelve and a half euro budget. the group evaluated the project process and found that they were satisfied with the overall score of the project . it was determined that they did not have enough room for the features to include in the remote to include all of the company logo and had already discussed in the previous meetings , but did not want to include the company colors and the logo . there was a lack of a discussion about whether the remote would have a lcd screen . all participants were instructed to fill out a final questionnaire and the team members will fill out the final questionnaire .",X,,X,,,X,,,6.0,T5-Baseline
46,"project manager : so hello .
marketing executive : good afternoon . i am a little late .
project manager : no problem .
marketing executive : got stuck in the traffic .
project manager : that is possible on this time of day . starts at three o'clock . our fourth and last meeting . this our last meeting . in this meeting we will discuss our final design . and we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . and then we are going to close the project today as . after this you will be free to go and spend all your money . and this design , detailed design meeting we will discuss the look - and - feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . , in order to do that we have this agenda . we will have the prototype presentation first . then we will set up some evaluation cri criteria . then we will look at the finance . we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . so we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half euro per remote . but we will see that later . then we will do the project evaluation , and the closing after that . we have got forty minutes . so we will be finished at half past three . but first we will do the this is prototype presentation . so , if some if somebody wants step forward .
industrial designer : this is what me and richard came up with . the default spot for the on - off button . the mute button just below that . then there is the volume and channel selectors . simple plus - minus button . we thought of a help button . if you hold it and you press another button , the help goes to the l_c_d _ screen . then there is the zero to one to zero buttons . a button for teletext . a button for the subtitles . and the company logo . so it is rather simple prototype . and we will have to see from testing how the users take it .
marketing executive : is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ?
user interface designer : so .
industrial designer : just pop in at any time .
marketing executive : when you are in teletext there usually are buttons where you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page .
user interface designer : that is just the normal as th as the normal remote controls you put it you came in page one hundred . now you can use the normal one to zero buttons .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : and you but you can also use the button th for changing the channel . s so the shifting button . for shif shifting up in on t teletext , and shifting down . so
marketing executive : .
project manager : . but in a few meetings earlier we tried to keep it simple . just a few buttons and large buttons .
user interface designer : ?
project manager : but these are altogether quite a few buttons . so i am wondering if we neely really need all of those buttons .
industrial designer : if you look at most controls , they have got more buttons than this . and the on - off button , it is a necessity . you ca not drop that one . the volume and channel buttons , you need those . the mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume - down button twice . so we could cancel that one . the help button really is necessary because there is no other way to know when someone wants to a button does .
user interface designer : or you can build in when you press one button
project manager : long time . if you put
user interface designer : but m we disc discuss that already . but we think old people that option . so they just put in put press the button and
project manager : .
industrial designer : you ca not leave out the number buttons i .
user interface designer : and
project manager : teletext and subtitles are necessary .
industrial designer : so it is rather basic already .
marketing executive : that is what i pointed out earlier . if you just make a control for just the t_v _ there is just not much to gain here .
project manager : . so we had somebody about th interfa something about the design of the buttons there ?
industrial designer : they are
project manager : just n normal plain buttons .
user interface designer : . ,
industrial designer : it is rather hard to draw on the white - board .
user interface designer : it
industrial designer : but they are supposed to be equal sized , round , with a little logo on it for the volume , the triangle and .
user interface designer : just to recognise it , so
industrial designer : just for recognition .
user interface designer : and now we do not need leds or y
project manager : no .
user interface designer : s some remote controls do it also , but because we use the little display we do not have to use it .
industrial designer : so and for the materials we have just chosen for rubber buttons . with a different colour than the case .
user interface designer : nay .
industrial designer : so they jump out . and that is about it .
project manager : that is . then because we only have thirty minutes left , i will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it is all possible what we wanna do . and tell you that we are going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half euros . if we see i if i have filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see something wrong . i counted two batteries . but maybe we can also use one . i if it is possible .
marketing executive : since it rechargeable .
project manager : it is rechargeable .
user interface designer : we can u just
project manager : that is two euros off . we need the advanced chip . so there is not much to save there . here we have the single curves . we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one euro . , i , but the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . we have to keep that .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : then we have the case material supplements . it is plastic . it is the cheapest one we need . so that is not much to save either . but then the biggest costs are the buttons . so maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our costs low . because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half euros at the end . , so if we let is fir first count the buttons we have now .
user interface designer : sixteen , i believe so .
project manager : because i sixteen . nah , that will be even more then . eighteen euros .
user interface designer : seventeen . with the help button .
project manager : seventeen . , including the help ?
marketing executive : damn .
project manager : . we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a number long . that saves us one euro already . then we have got fifteen ?
marketing executive : would not
project manager : fifteen buttons .
marketing executive : no . that would not be an option .
project manager : and this is
marketing executive : d i assume you would count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ?
project manager : no those are one , .
user interface designer : where did
marketing executive : think actually there are two buttons ,
user interface designer : it is just one button .
marketing executive : are not they ?
user interface designer : but , . there were two for one big button . but they are more expensive than the small ones . so
project manager : but th it is not stated in this files .
user interface designer : it is just a .
project manager : so maybe we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing
marketing executive : i was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button .
project manager : that is possibility as .
marketing executive : that would cut the cost .
project manager : and it is good for the design as . so you can make let is see . if you make this looks a bit like a cross .
user interface designer : but i if it is cheaper .
project manager : s channel .
user interface designer : so ,
project manager : w
user interface designer : we have still got four buttons , but just so
project manager : th they count the materials .
user interface designer : you got not a butt button itself , but on the
project manager : on the chip there .
user interface designer : on the chip you have got still four buttons .
project manager : but because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button .
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : but , this really is four buttons anyhow .
project manager : but no but . maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it is impossible to get the twelve and a half euros . also the l_c _ display , it is too expensive for the display we use .
marketing executive : yes .
industrial designer : that is a big cost .
project manager : they try t
industrial designer : if we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip .
project manager : but what is the big advantage of our remote then ?
marketing executive : only the docking station , i .
industrial designer : which is not the docking station is not even in this c s schematic . it is not even taken into the price .
project manager : that is extra .
marketing executive : maybe we should to a different supplier .
project manager : that is an option . polish supplier . do not you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as .
industrial designer : we we could save money on it . but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ?
marketing executive : that is what i am wondering .
industrial designer : my mother ca not even send an s_m_s _ message .
project manager : . that is a point .
user interface designer : are we gonna buy a remote control when you can use it ? we m we must stay below the below twelve fifty or ca not go
marketing executive : since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it is feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . especially since we have those features .
project manager : but we have to stick to the twelve and a half euros . we do not have any more budget to develop it .
user interface designer : is it impossible to
industrial designer : the margin will get too small .
user interface designer : but it is possible to make one for twelve fifty .
project manager : it is . if you leave out the l_c _ display . and if you use less buttons . say or you can take the single chip .
user interface designer : i do not .
marketing executive : it would be a pretty rigid one .
user interface designer : s but , you ca not use
industrial designer : ten .
project manager : there it is . but then w good looking .
user interface designer : wi with n , with attractive o options . you can stay below twelve fifty .
project manager : it is difficult as ,
marketing executive : or b becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control .
industrial designer : no remote .
project manager : or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . then w
user interface designer : scroll - wheel is one .
industrial designer : that is
project manager : because then we save ten buttons .
user interface designer : no ,
project manager : then we have five and one . if we have this one and we have got the advanced w , we are getting close .
industrial designer : we are getting closer .
marketing executive : but how does scroll - wheel work here ?
project manager : then you will or maybe you can scroll . if you scroll you will see the numbers on the l_c_d _ display . until you have got the right number , then you push it .
marketing executive : that would bring up the price of the scroll - wheel also . integrated scroll - wheel push - button .
project manager : alright . it is got ta scroll and push . but then you can push some other button as .
marketing executive : but .
industrial designer : you could just not scroll for a half a second .
project manager : . so if you scroll to a number and then you a half second , then it g turns to that channel .
industrial designer : so you wo not need a button .
marketing executive : that would be like the end of our usability .
project manager : but it would definitely crop cost , a lot .
user interface designer : d
marketing executive : but
project manager : and we need the battery . and the regular chip is not possible ? it has to be advanced ?
industrial designer : if you want to use an l_c_d _ screen you need an advanced chip , yes .
project manager : it has to be advanced . and we can save a euro by a flat design . that is an option we can
user interface designer : ja ja .
project manager : then we are almost there .
industrial designer : if you v could just leave out one more button .
project manager : if we
user interface designer : or we have to skip the subtitle button .
project manager : but that is that is a big advantage , if we are
user interface designer : it is a big advantage . but , it is
project manager : can we use ca not we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : so .
project manager : if you push it three times ?
marketing executive : think it is the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight , and teletext disappears . but the subtitles stay there .
user interface designer : but if you push the teletext button twice
industrial designer : what if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? eight hundred eighty eight .
marketing executive : that is the case on most
user interface designer : it is one m one b , a few buttons .
project manager : that is not really that
marketing executive : that could be just like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : but then again that would be d j just not an option for older people ,
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : who do not even a scroll - wheel is . holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . with only five buttons on it . and a scroll - wheel .
project manager : if you make a good advertisement on television and in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . if you just make it real simple . because it saves a lot of money . and we can keep our l_c_d _ screen , which can provide extra information . how to use the scroll wheel . how to use the other bu buttons as subtitles .
marketing executive : true .
project manager : and it is good for the innovative design as . if you would erase these . and we put looks a bit odd maybe .
marketing executive : that is a pretty big scroll wheel .
project manager : that is something like that . we have got the scroll - wheel . one , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . and these are two buttons then .
industrial designer : we could make two buttons out of that . and just if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll - wheel . so that would save two buttons . if you do the same for the channel .
project manager : . that is really a good idea , . and it will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious .
industrial designer : more obvious .
project manager : so we make one for the volume , one for the channel .
industrial designer : if we
project manager : so we have got one , two , three . we can leave the teletext in if we want . that is m that is better .
marketing executive : so this is five buttons .
industrial designer : if we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat case . and make it smaller overall .
project manager : y .
industrial designer : so if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on - off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button
project manager : and then you can
industrial designer : you get a much smaller remote . and it sh
project manager : so we can decrease this one to four buttons .
industrial designer : ?
marketing executive : right now we have five .
user interface designer : but , you can make a f quite a big remote control for just the same price as a small one .
project manager : . that is no problem .
user interface designer : just you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . it it is a bit
project manager : it is it is more the moulds in which they are being made , . single curved is really easy to just fill in . and cases come right out of the machine . and single curved you have to have a different machine , than a flat one . this is a really easy one . , what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? freek , what do you think ?
marketing executive : i still think we should go for the single curve design . but then again , all these changes are not really with me .
industrial designer : richard is argument was very good .
marketing executive : but since we just have to .
project manager : we have to cut costs . i am ag
marketing executive : i would rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a remote .
project manager : ask for more money . i am agreeing with the usability .
marketing executive : or do some market research and see what the options are .
project manager : but th we can then keep the single curved one . just to express our l_c_d _ screen a bit more . so people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . it will be necessary to have good help function , as . this is scroll . it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . before we went on to the whole design .
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : the th
project manager : but i am glad we could make a bit . it is pretty different , if you saw the last one than this one .
marketing executive : it is pretty different . but this is not really like for the group we were making our remote .
user interface designer : no .
marketing executive : this will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell .
project manager : .
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : if older people like familiar forms and familiar . this is not familiar for them .
project manager : no ,
marketing executive : so we are gonna have to do a lotta convincing them .
project manager : the most
user interface designer : but they know the scroll - buttons from old radios . they cal also buttons like that for changing channels .
project manager : we can let l
user interface designer : so maybe it is
project manager : we can stick it out , a bit . like a old buttons . maybe that is recognisable for them as . that is a good one . i am afraid we have to move on . and it is b less frightening , . if they see this design they think , there are only five buttons , and but we will see .
marketing executive : that is true . might might be confusing too .
project manager : . that is definitely right .
user interface designer :  .
marketing executive : they would be like , what ? only five buttons ?
user interface designer : but very special ,
project manager : i would buy it .
marketing executive : but you are not sixty .
project manager : i would buy it if i was six . what it costs under twelve and a half euros ? , yes they are . but we can go on with the project evaluation . we still have fifteen minutes left , so we are on schedule . , the project process .
marketing executive : so , i like set up all these criteria . and evaluation of the thingy .
project manager : evaluation criteria . that was the point i forgot . i should there we are . evaluation criteria . we have got five minutes for those criteria .
marketing executive : five more minutes ?
project manager : no we have got fifteen minutes yes .
marketing executive : so i did some literature study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . translated it into criteria , which would be these . , is the remote fancy ? the shape , look and feel . what new functions are there ? , easy to use ? , learnability is a very important factor here . , is it functional ? are there not too many functions among the functions ? and are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? the target group . is the remote really for the group we are making it for ? and recognability . if our company is if it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? and so we are supposed to evaluate it right now . i have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting were not here .
project manager : that is because my pen failed to upload his data . i tried to
marketing executive : interesting .
project manager : but it is giving errors by downloading the software .
marketing executive : so is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ?
project manager : it is fancy .
industrial designer : six .
project manager : .
user interface designer : six .
marketing executive : we all go for six ? , is the design innovative ?
project manager : very .
user interface designer : . sh
marketing executive : so , with our l_c_d _ screen , docking station , scroll - buttons .
project manager : subtitles , buttons .
marketing executive : seven ?
project manager : so we have got twenty cents for our docking station , ?
marketing executive : should be do - able . is the design easy to use ?
user interface designer : .
project manager : that is a bit dodgy .
marketing executive : would be for us . but
user interface designer : for old people i
project manager : i would say four . four or five between . between four or five .
user interface designer : w
industrial designer : four or five .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : i would go for four , too .
project manager : is it functional ?
marketing executive : is the design functional ? , do we have all functions that we want to include ?
user interface designer : n
marketing executive : we do . do we have too many functions ? it is pretty slim .
project manager : think it is seven .
marketing executive : seven . and do we take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? like it getting lost and r_s_i _ influences ?
user interface designer : m
industrial designer : we have not thought of that one .
project manager : it was .
marketing executive : think we do .
project manager : i had them worked out . they are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost .
marketing executive : are the production costs within the preset limits ? does the design fit the group of focus ?
user interface designer : th .
industrial designer : that is a three .
project manager : with our new radio button , it is better .
marketing executive : it does not .
user interface designer : we have to test it s but
marketing executive : i .
industrial designer : i still it is too m too fancy . too too flashy .
project manager : it
marketing executive : a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control .
user interface designer : true .
project manager : i would give it a four .
marketing executive : i am not . i would go for two .
user interface designer : i go for three .
project manager : then we have to do the three . it is the
marketing executive : is the company recognisable ?
project manager : yes it is .
marketing executive : we have the logo there .
project manager : and they wanna put fashion in their products . in the slogan of the company . and we have the removable front cases . so , it is very recognisable .
marketing executive : so that will be this . i was also supposed to calculate the score , but thought we would have another private thingy after this .
project manager : we have got a calculate it .
industrial designer : twendag sieven an twendag .
marketing executive : is this like after this , are we done ? or
project manager : n we have gonna we are going to evaluate it .
marketing executive : we are gonna go to our other room again . these are seven factors times seven is forty something .
project manager : forty nine .
marketing executive : nine ? minus three , minus four . so that would be minus eight . forty one out of forty nine .
project manager : forty one . that is around eighty percent .
marketing executive : i will just type that in on the bottom here .
project manager : that is eighty four percent . that is a pretty score .
marketing executive : . so that will be the evaluation .
project manager : that brings us to the project evaluation . project process . did we move through the right phases , you think ? along the process ?
user interface designer : but it
marketing executive : think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . in the design phase .
project manager : so lack of information about prices .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : .
project manager : satisfaction . was there room for creativity ?
marketing executive : not too much .
project manager : it is because of the finance sheet .
industrial designer : there w there was enough room , but the finance
marketing executive : true .
project manager : the room was .
marketing executive : and i would have liked to go for the younger users also . and just to be able to access internet and get something of your own .
project manager : restrictions . internet access . was it clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions ? did it work out ? working together ? also , you two of you with the last phase ?
industrial designer : yes , was . the tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it is very easy .
project manager : tasks . were the means sufficient for the tasks we had to do ? or were they too much ?
industrial designer : the smart - board , the d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but the digital the digital pen is very .
project manager : smart - board . if it wants to download its data .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : failed download . smart - board was irritating . so you rather wanted to have a flip - over ?
industrial designer : a flip - over or a more precise digit
user interface designer : a flipper is easier ,
project manager : faster as , .
user interface designer : but if you want to share of when you make a picture like this on the presentation , it is easier to share it with other people . you can sh save it and put it on the internet , or in shared f folder or sh shared directory .
marketing executive : i tried to open the file on my laptop ,
user interface designer : no ?
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : but not possible .
project manager : you need a smart board application . but you can
user interface designer : t can you export it like a .
project manager : . should be possible . you can export it as image .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : must must be
marketing executive : should have done that then .
project manager : the sharing of the information was ?
marketing executive : pen is here .
project manager : network . , pen is here on the table .
user interface designer : you can
project manager : . it is possible .
user interface designer : it is possible .
project manager : have we found new ideas for having this meetings ? or
user interface designer : maybe when we n just give the numbers of o one of out of s sev it is easier to do the th things that are like that on a computer . , so just l like at u university
project manager : so . so everybody puts his own score . and then it mediates the score , and you can get one that is better . so that is how do we call ? evaluation criteria . , any more ideas ? or questions about the project ? or about the product ? because then that we get to our last sheet . are the costs within the budget ?
marketing executive : they are .
industrial designer : considering we are not going to make a docking station .
project manager : do we docking station . that is a good point . but maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ? and you can compensate that as .
industrial designer : perhaps .
project manager : so that should not be the biggest problem , because it is very cheap to make as .
industrial designer :  .
project manager : do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? or what was it ?
marketing executive : fifty grand .
project manager : fifteen fifteen million . if we gonna export this product . it is innovative . especially in america . people are pretty decadent .
marketing executive : still if we are n gonna make a scroll - button anyway it would be more for the younger people than for the older people .
project manager : you can do more .
marketing executive : so maybe we should just re - focus .
project manager : just put it on the market for everybody . you can you can change markets where by changing the front covers .
marketing executive : or specifically for younger people .
project manager : that is one thing you can change it with . so you can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy covers on the market . just as a test . see how it works . that is a good advantage .
marketing executive : then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . even if it were their covers .
project manager : then we can have our little celebration , right now .
marketing executive : party party .
project manager : we still have to fit in one more questionnaire .
user interface designer : where is the champagne ?
project manager : i . i did not get a message from the from ending of the
user interface designer : i believe y
project manager : i have one now .
marketing executive : you did .
project manager : five more minutes ? then we still have some questions . if somebody has some questions they can ask them now . or we can put these in the project folder as . maybe that is export as picture , . this is another network , i . does somebody see the project folder ?
user interface designer : maybe they will save it .
project manager : i will just put it in my documents
marketing executive : it probably will .
project manager : and i am going to make our final presentation now .
marketing executive : you are supposed to make a final
project manager : and then i will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . summary of the project .
marketing executive : are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ?
user interface designer : maybe we have to fill another questionnaire .
project manager : . questionnaire . you all get a questionnaire in your room . and then i will meet you in about ten minutes , . hopefully my pen will download its software .
marketing executive : that would be .",,"the project manager opened the meeting . the industrial designer presented the prototype design , which featured just a few buttons and a company logo . the user interface designer presented an alternative design for the remote which featured a larger number of buttons . the marketing expert conducted a product evaluation of the prototype . the team found that their prototype was fairly simple and that they could retain all the functions they had originally decided upon without exceeding the project budget . the project then looked at the project finances and had to decide which features to retain or lose in order to stay within the budget . in maintaining the target cost , the team had to lose a number of features which they originally wanted , such as a teletext button and a feature to locate the remote when misplaced . the group evaluated the project process and felt that they worked well together and were pleased with the equipment they had at their disposal . they have to fill out a final questionnaire . the remote will use a simple chip . the case will be double-curved . the buttons will be made of plastic with rubber grips on the sides and rubber buttons on the top of the remote . the production costs cannot exceed 12.50 euro . na .",X,,,,X,X,,,3.0,BART-Baseline
47,"project manager : so hello .
marketing executive : good afternoon . i am a little late .
project manager : no problem .
marketing executive : got stuck in the traffic .
project manager : that is possible on this time of day . starts at three o'clock . our fourth and last meeting . this our last meeting . in this meeting we will discuss our final design . and we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . and then we are going to close the project today as . after this you will be free to go and spend all your money . and this design , detailed design meeting we will discuss the look - and - feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . , in order to do that we have this agenda . we will have the prototype presentation first . then we will set up some evaluation cri criteria . then we will look at the finance . we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . so we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half euro per remote . but we will see that later . then we will do the project evaluation , and the closing after that . we have got forty minutes . so we will be finished at half past three . but first we will do the this is prototype presentation . so , if some if somebody wants step forward .
industrial designer : this is what me and richard came up with . the default spot for the on - off button . the mute button just below that . then there is the volume and channel selectors . simple plus - minus button . we thought of a help button . if you hold it and you press another button , the help goes to the l_c_d _ screen . then there is the zero to one to zero buttons . a button for teletext . a button for the subtitles . and the company logo . so it is rather simple prototype . and we will have to see from testing how the users take it .
marketing executive : is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ?
user interface designer : so .
industrial designer : just pop in at any time .
marketing executive : when you are in teletext there usually are buttons where you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page .
user interface designer : that is just the normal as th as the normal remote controls you put it you came in page one hundred . now you can use the normal one to zero buttons .
marketing executive :  .
user interface designer : and you but you can also use the button th for changing the channel . s so the shifting button . for shif shifting up in on t teletext , and shifting down . so
marketing executive : .
project manager : . but in a few meetings earlier we tried to keep it simple . just a few buttons and large buttons .
user interface designer : ?
project manager : but these are altogether quite a few buttons . so i am wondering if we neely really need all of those buttons .
industrial designer : if you look at most controls , they have got more buttons than this . and the on - off button , it is a necessity . you ca not drop that one . the volume and channel buttons , you need those . the mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume - down button twice . so we could cancel that one . the help button really is necessary because there is no other way to know when someone wants to a button does .
user interface designer : or you can build in when you press one button
project manager : long time . if you put
user interface designer : but m we disc discuss that already . but we think old people that option . so they just put in put press the button and
project manager : .
industrial designer : you ca not leave out the number buttons i .
user interface designer : and
project manager : teletext and subtitles are necessary .
industrial designer : so it is rather basic already .
marketing executive : that is what i pointed out earlier . if you just make a control for just the t_v _ there is just not much to gain here .
project manager : . so we had somebody about th interfa something about the design of the buttons there ?
industrial designer : they are
project manager : just n normal plain buttons .
user interface designer : . ,
industrial designer : it is rather hard to draw on the white - board .
user interface designer : it
industrial designer : but they are supposed to be equal sized , round , with a little logo on it for the volume , the triangle and .
user interface designer : just to recognise it , so
industrial designer : just for recognition .
user interface designer : and now we do not need leds or y
project manager : no .
user interface designer : s some remote controls do it also , but because we use the little display we do not have to use it .
industrial designer : so and for the materials we have just chosen for rubber buttons . with a different colour than the case .
user interface designer : nay .
industrial designer : so they jump out . and that is about it .
project manager : that is . then because we only have thirty minutes left , i will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it is all possible what we wanna do . and tell you that we are going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half euros . if we see i if i have filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see something wrong . i counted two batteries . but maybe we can also use one . i if it is possible .
marketing executive : since it rechargeable .
project manager : it is rechargeable .
user interface designer : we can u just
project manager : that is two euros off . we need the advanced chip . so there is not much to save there . here we have the single curves . we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one euro . , i , but the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . we have to keep that .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : then we have the case material supplements . it is plastic . it is the cheapest one we need . so that is not much to save either . but then the biggest costs are the buttons . so maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our costs low . because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half euros at the end . , so if we let is fir first count the buttons we have now .
user interface designer : sixteen , i believe so .
project manager : because i sixteen . nah , that will be even more then . eighteen euros .
user interface designer : seventeen . with the help button .
project manager : seventeen . , including the help ?
marketing executive : damn .
project manager : . we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a number long . that saves us one euro already . then we have got fifteen ?
marketing executive : would not
project manager : fifteen buttons .
marketing executive : no . that would not be an option .
project manager : and this is
marketing executive : d i assume you would count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ?
project manager : no those are one , .
user interface designer : where did
marketing executive : think actually there are two buttons ,
user interface designer : it is just one button .
marketing executive : are not they ?
user interface designer : but , . there were two for one big button . but they are more expensive than the small ones . so
project manager : but th it is not stated in this files .
user interface designer : it is just a .
project manager : so maybe we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing
marketing executive : i was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button .
project manager : that is possibility as .
marketing executive : that would cut the cost .
project manager : and it is good for the design as . so you can make let is see . if you make this looks a bit like a cross .
user interface designer : but i if it is cheaper .
project manager : s channel .
user interface designer : so ,
project manager : w
user interface designer : we have still got four buttons , but just so
project manager : th they count the materials .
user interface designer : you got not a butt button itself , but on the
project manager : on the chip there .
user interface designer : on the chip you have got still four buttons .
project manager : but because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button .
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : but , this really is four buttons anyhow .
project manager : but no but . maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it is impossible to get the twelve and a half euros . also the l_c _ display , it is too expensive for the display we use .
marketing executive : yes .
industrial designer : that is a big cost .
project manager : they try t
industrial designer : if we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip .
project manager : but what is the big advantage of our remote then ?
marketing executive : only the docking station , i .
industrial designer : which is not the docking station is not even in this c s schematic . it is not even taken into the price .
project manager : that is extra .
marketing executive : maybe we should to a different supplier .
project manager : that is an option . polish supplier . do not you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as .
industrial designer : we we could save money on it . but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ?
marketing executive : that is what i am wondering .
industrial designer : my mother ca not even send an s_m_s _ message .
project manager : . that is a point .
user interface designer : are we gonna buy a remote control when you can use it ? we m we must stay below the below twelve fifty or ca not go
marketing executive : since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it is feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . especially since we have those features .
project manager : but we have to stick to the twelve and a half euros . we do not have any more budget to develop it .
user interface designer : is it impossible to
industrial designer : the margin will get too small .
user interface designer : but it is possible to make one for twelve fifty .
project manager : it is . if you leave out the l_c _ display . and if you use less buttons . say or you can take the single chip .
user interface designer : i do not .
marketing executive : it would be a pretty rigid one .
user interface designer : s but , you ca not use
industrial designer : ten .
project manager : there it is . but then w good looking .
user interface designer : wi with n , with attractive o options . you can stay below twelve fifty .
project manager : it is difficult as ,
marketing executive : or b becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control .
industrial designer : no remote .
project manager : or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . then w
user interface designer : scroll - wheel is one .
industrial designer : that is
project manager : because then we save ten buttons .
user interface designer : no ,
project manager : then we have five and one . if we have this one and we have got the advanced w , we are getting close .
industrial designer : we are getting closer .
marketing executive : but how does scroll - wheel work here ?
project manager : then you will or maybe you can scroll . if you scroll you will see the numbers on the l_c_d _ display . until you have got the right number , then you push it .
marketing executive : that would bring up the price of the scroll - wheel also . integrated scroll - wheel push - button .
project manager : alright . it is got ta scroll and push . but then you can push some other button as .
marketing executive : but .
industrial designer : you could just not scroll for a half a second .
project manager : . so if you scroll to a number and then you a half second , then it g turns to that channel .
industrial designer : so you wo not need a button .
marketing executive : that would be like the end of our usability .
project manager : but it would definitely crop cost , a lot .
user interface designer : d
marketing executive : but
project manager : and we need the battery . and the regular chip is not possible ? it has to be advanced ?
industrial designer : if you want to use an l_c_d _ screen you need an advanced chip , yes .
project manager : it has to be advanced . and we can save a euro by a flat design . that is an option we can
user interface designer : ja ja .
project manager : then we are almost there .
industrial designer : if you v could just leave out one more button .
project manager : if we
user interface designer : or we have to skip the subtitle button .
project manager : but that is that is a big advantage , if we are
user interface designer : it is a big advantage . but , it is
project manager : can we use ca not we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : so .
project manager : if you push it three times ?
marketing executive : think it is the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight , and teletext disappears . but the subtitles stay there .
user interface designer : but if you push the teletext button twice
industrial designer : what if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? eight hundred eighty eight .
marketing executive : that is the case on most
user interface designer : it is one m one b , a few buttons .
project manager : that is not really that
marketing executive : that could be just like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : but then again that would be d j just not an option for older people ,
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : who do not even a scroll - wheel is . holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . with only five buttons on it . and a scroll - wheel .
project manager : if you make a good advertisement on television and in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . if you just make it real simple . because it saves a lot of money . and we can keep our l_c_d _ screen , which can provide extra information . how to use the scroll wheel . how to use the other bu buttons as subtitles .
marketing executive : true .
project manager : and it is good for the innovative design as . if you would erase these . and we put looks a bit odd maybe .
marketing executive : that is a pretty big scroll wheel .
project manager : that is something like that . we have got the scroll - wheel . one , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . and these are two buttons then .
industrial designer : we could make two buttons out of that . and just if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll - wheel . so that would save two buttons . if you do the same for the channel .
project manager : . that is really a good idea , . and it will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious .
industrial designer : more obvious .
project manager : so we make one for the volume , one for the channel .
industrial designer : if we
project manager : so we have got one , two , three . we can leave the teletext in if we want . that is m that is better .
marketing executive : so this is five buttons .
industrial designer : if we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat case . and make it smaller overall .
project manager : y .
industrial designer : so if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on - off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button
project manager : and then you can
industrial designer : you get a much smaller remote . and it sh
project manager : so we can decrease this one to four buttons .
industrial designer : ?
marketing executive : right now we have five .
user interface designer : but , you can make a f quite a big remote control for just the same price as a small one .
project manager : . that is no problem .
user interface designer : just you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . it it is a bit
project manager : it is it is more the moulds in which they are being made , . single curved is really easy to just fill in . and cases come right out of the machine . and single curved you have to have a different machine , than a flat one . this is a really easy one . , what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? freek , what do you think ?
marketing executive : i still think we should go for the single curve design . but then again , all these changes are not really with me .
industrial designer : richard is argument was very good .
marketing executive : but since we just have to .
project manager : we have to cut costs . i am ag
marketing executive : i would rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a remote .
project manager : ask for more money . i am agreeing with the usability .
marketing executive : or do some market research and see what the options are .
project manager : but th we can then keep the single curved one . just to express our l_c_d _ screen a bit more . so people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . it will be necessary to have good help function , as . this is scroll . it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . before we went on to the whole design .
marketing executive : yes .
user interface designer : the th
project manager : but i am glad we could make a bit . it is pretty different , if you saw the last one than this one .
marketing executive : it is pretty different . but this is not really like for the group we were making our remote .
user interface designer : no .
marketing executive : this will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell .
project manager : .
user interface designer : but
marketing executive : if older people like familiar forms and familiar . this is not familiar for them .
project manager : no ,
marketing executive : so we are gonna have to do a lotta convincing them .
project manager : the most
user interface designer : but they know the scroll - buttons from old radios . they cal also buttons like that for changing channels .
project manager : we can let l
user interface designer : so maybe it is
project manager : we can stick it out , a bit . like a old buttons . maybe that is recognisable for them as . that is a good one . i am afraid we have to move on . and it is b less frightening , . if they see this design they think , there are only five buttons , and but we will see .
marketing executive : that is true . might might be confusing too .
project manager : . that is definitely right .
user interface designer :  .
marketing executive : they would be like , what ? only five buttons ?
user interface designer : but very special ,
project manager : i would buy it .
marketing executive : but you are not sixty .
project manager : i would buy it if i was six . what it costs under twelve and a half euros ? , yes they are . but we can go on with the project evaluation . we still have fifteen minutes left , so we are on schedule . , the project process .
marketing executive : so , i like set up all these criteria . and evaluation of the thingy .
project manager : evaluation criteria . that was the point i forgot . i should there we are . evaluation criteria . we have got five minutes for those criteria .
marketing executive : five more minutes ?
project manager : no we have got fifteen minutes yes .
marketing executive : so i did some literature study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . translated it into criteria , which would be these . , is the remote fancy ? the shape , look and feel . what new functions are there ? , easy to use ? , learnability is a very important factor here . , is it functional ? are there not too many functions among the functions ? and are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? the target group . is the remote really for the group we are making it for ? and recognability . if our company is if it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? and so we are supposed to evaluate it right now . i have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting were not here .
project manager : that is because my pen failed to upload his data . i tried to
marketing executive : interesting .
project manager : but it is giving errors by downloading the software .
marketing executive : so is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ?
project manager : it is fancy .
industrial designer : six .
project manager : .
user interface designer : six .
marketing executive : we all go for six ? , is the design innovative ?
project manager : very .
user interface designer : . sh
marketing executive : so , with our l_c_d _ screen , docking station , scroll - buttons .
project manager : subtitles , buttons .
marketing executive : seven ?
project manager : so we have got twenty cents for our docking station , ?
marketing executive : should be do - able . is the design easy to use ?
user interface designer : .
project manager : that is a bit dodgy .
marketing executive : would be for us . but
user interface designer : for old people i
project manager : i would say four . four or five between . between four or five .
user interface designer : w
industrial designer : four or five .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : i would go for four , too .
project manager : is it functional ?
marketing executive : is the design functional ? , do we have all functions that we want to include ?
user interface designer : n
marketing executive : we do . do we have too many functions ? it is pretty slim .
project manager : think it is seven .
marketing executive : seven . and do we take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? like it getting lost and r_s_i _ influences ?
user interface designer : m
industrial designer : we have not thought of that one .
project manager : it was .
marketing executive : think we do .
project manager : i had them worked out . they are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost .
marketing executive : are the production costs within the preset limits ? does the design fit the group of focus ?
user interface designer : th .
industrial designer : that is a three .
project manager : with our new radio button , it is better .
marketing executive : it does not .
user interface designer : we have to test it s but
marketing executive : i .
industrial designer : i still it is too m too fancy . too too flashy .
project manager : it
marketing executive : a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control .
user interface designer : true .
project manager : i would give it a four .
marketing executive : i am not . i would go for two .
user interface designer : i go for three .
project manager : then we have to do the three . it is the
marketing executive : is the company recognisable ?
project manager : yes it is .
marketing executive : we have the logo there .
project manager : and they wanna put fashion in their products . in the slogan of the company . and we have the removable front cases . so , it is very recognisable .
marketing executive : so that will be this . i was also supposed to calculate the score , but thought we would have another private thingy after this .
project manager : we have got a calculate it .
industrial designer : twendag sieven an twendag .
marketing executive : is this like after this , are we done ? or
project manager : n we have gonna we are going to evaluate it .
marketing executive : we are gonna go to our other room again . these are seven factors times seven is forty something .
project manager : forty nine .
marketing executive : nine ? minus three , minus four . so that would be minus eight . forty one out of forty nine .
project manager : forty one . that is around eighty percent .
marketing executive : i will just type that in on the bottom here .
project manager : that is eighty four percent . that is a pretty score .
marketing executive : . so that will be the evaluation .
project manager : that brings us to the project evaluation . project process . did we move through the right phases , you think ? along the process ?
user interface designer : but it
marketing executive : think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . in the design phase .
project manager : so lack of information about prices .
industrial designer : .
marketing executive : .
project manager : satisfaction . was there room for creativity ?
marketing executive : not too much .
project manager : it is because of the finance sheet .
industrial designer : there w there was enough room , but the finance
marketing executive : true .
project manager : the room was .
marketing executive : and i would have liked to go for the younger users also . and just to be able to access internet and get something of your own .
project manager : restrictions . internet access . was it clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions ? did it work out ? working together ? also , you two of you with the last phase ?
industrial designer : yes , was . the tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it is very easy .
project manager : tasks . were the means sufficient for the tasks we had to do ? or were they too much ?
industrial designer : the smart - board , the d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but the digital the digital pen is very .
project manager : smart - board . if it wants to download its data .
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : failed download . smart - board was irritating . so you rather wanted to have a flip - over ?
industrial designer : a flip - over or a more precise digit
user interface designer : a flipper is easier ,
project manager : faster as , .
user interface designer : but if you want to share of when you make a picture like this on the presentation , it is easier to share it with other people . you can sh save it and put it on the internet , or in shared f folder or sh shared directory .
marketing executive : i tried to open the file on my laptop ,
user interface designer : no ?
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : but not possible .
project manager : you need a smart board application . but you can
user interface designer : t can you export it like a .
project manager : . should be possible . you can export it as image .
marketing executive : no .
project manager : must must be
marketing executive : should have done that then .
project manager : the sharing of the information was ?
marketing executive : pen is here .
project manager : network . , pen is here on the table .
user interface designer : you can
project manager : . it is possible .
user interface designer : it is possible .
project manager : have we found new ideas for having this meetings ? or
user interface designer : maybe when we n just give the numbers of o one of out of s sev it is easier to do the th things that are like that on a computer . , so just l like at u university
project manager : so . so everybody puts his own score . and then it mediates the score , and you can get one that is better . so that is how do we call ? evaluation criteria . , any more ideas ? or questions about the project ? or about the product ? because then that we get to our last sheet . are the costs within the budget ?
marketing executive : they are .
industrial designer : considering we are not going to make a docking station .
project manager : do we docking station . that is a good point . but maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ? and you can compensate that as .
industrial designer : perhaps .
project manager : so that should not be the biggest problem , because it is very cheap to make as .
industrial designer :  .
project manager : do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? or what was it ?
marketing executive : fifty grand .
project manager : fifteen fifteen million . if we gonna export this product . it is innovative . especially in america . people are pretty decadent .
marketing executive : still if we are n gonna make a scroll - button anyway it would be more for the younger people than for the older people .
project manager : you can do more .
marketing executive : so maybe we should just re - focus .
project manager : just put it on the market for everybody . you can you can change markets where by changing the front covers .
marketing executive : or specifically for younger people .
project manager : that is one thing you can change it with . so you can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy covers on the market . just as a test . see how it works . that is a good advantage .
marketing executive : then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . even if it were their covers .
project manager : then we can have our little celebration , right now .
marketing executive : party party .
project manager : we still have to fit in one more questionnaire .
user interface designer : where is the champagne ?
project manager : i . i did not get a message from the from ending of the
user interface designer : i believe y
project manager : i have one now .
marketing executive : you did .
project manager : five more minutes ? then we still have some questions . if somebody has some questions they can ask them now . or we can put these in the project folder as . maybe that is export as picture , . this is another network , i . does somebody see the project folder ?
user interface designer : maybe they will save it .
project manager : i will just put it in my documents
marketing executive : it probably will .
project manager : and i am going to make our final presentation now .
marketing executive : you are supposed to make a final
project manager : and then i will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . summary of the project .
marketing executive : are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ?
user interface designer : maybe we have to fill another questionnaire .
project manager : . questionnaire . you all get a questionnaire in your room . and then i will meet you in about ten minutes , . hopefully my pen will download its software .
marketing executive : that would be .",,"the project manager opened the meeting and then the user interface designer and industrial designer presented the prototype , which featured a simple design with only a few buttons . the marketing expert gave the product evaluation , which showed that the functionality of the prototype was satisfied by the group . the group then looked at the project budget and found that everything they wanted to include was within the budget . they also had difficulties with the over budget amount of features . they were satisfied with the prototype design and felt that they had room to be creative , but only after they changed many of the initial specifications . the team then conducted an evaluation of the project process . they found that they worked well together , had excellent teamwork , and were pleased with the product . they will fill out a final questionnaire . the remote will use a simple chip . the case will be made of plastic with rubber buttons on the side and rubber buttons below it . the teletext and channel buttons will be accessed through the channel-changing buttons . there will also be a power button and mute button . the prototype has been evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). the criteria used were simplicity of design , technological innovation , ease of use , whether people would be willing to spend 12.50 euro for it , whether it would be easy to find when lost , and whether it meets the group's budget . the final score was 2.6. the group had problems with their computers and much of the meeting-room equipment .",X,,,X,,,,,7.0,BART-Cons
48,"user interface designer : hi .
industrial designer : hi .
project manager : hello .
user interface designer : good morning .
industrial designer : morning .
marketing executive : good morning .
project manager : before i start with the meeting i have a few things to tell you about the setting we are in , because we are being watched by big brother . so
marketing executive : by big brother ?
project manager : . this these are cameras , so are these . this thing that looks like a pie ,
marketing executive :  .
project manager : are actually all microphones . you must be careful with all this . and as see you have placed your laptops exactly on the place where it must be . and that has to do with the camera settings , so we do not have our laptops in front of the cameras .
marketing executive : of our faces .
project manager : and so they can see our faces . welcome at the kick - off meeting . my name is danny wolfs . this is the agenda for today . first a little opening . i will introduce myself , and it is very good to introduce yourself . then a little bit of acquaintance , acquaintance to ourselves . so we get to know each other . that will be done with a tool training from the he these two smart boards . then the project plan . what we are going to do , and how we are going to do it . and discussion about that and a little closing at the end . , my name is danny wolfs . i am the project manager . what is your name ?
user interface designer : i am juergen toffs . i am the user interface designer .
project manager : user interface , .
industrial designer : hi , my name is . i am the industrial designer .
project manager : industrial , yes .
marketing executive : i am tim . my function is the marketing expert .
project manager : first a little about the project aim . the aim is to make a new remote control . maybe you have read the website . it is a very , very ambitious company . they they wanna do something else . i w there must be a new remote control . first of all it must be original , and trendy . that is two things really close to each other . but at the same time user - friendly . and they have that is very important for them . there are three stages . there is a functional design . what are we going to do ? what are we going to make f functions in the remote ? and why are we going to do it ? then the conceptual design . how are going to do it ? and that is really global . because at the detailed design , how , part two , we go to dig in really about how the te the technical of if it is possible technical - wise . each stage is broken up in two stages , individual work and a meeting . so it is very straightforward . the tool training . we have two smart boards . this one is for the presentations , the powerpoint presentations or the word presentation of whatever you had . and this is only for drawing . we must let it stand on this programme . this is called a smart board
marketing executive : speaks for itself .
project manager : thing it speaks for itself . and as you may have heard , the documents in the shared folder can be showed on this screen . not in y the my documents . so if you wanna show something , put it in the shared folder . this is very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . i do not gonna explain it all , because how it works . we must not forget everything we draw on here , all must be saved . we we may not delete anything . so if you have drawn something , save it . never delete it . that is a very important thing . little kinda exercise to know each other . at the white board on the left . every every one of us must draw our favourite animal , and tell us why we had chosen that animal . important is that we use different colours , and different pen widths .
marketing executive : i have a question .
project manager : yes ?
marketing executive : this exercise , did the company board tell you to do it , or did you just make it up yourself ?
project manager : no no . it is it is i must do it .
marketing executive : it is part of the introduction ,
project manager : . we really each other , and it is kinda new . so getting used to each other , we can have a little fun then , before we dig in really to the hard . would you start with drawing your favourite animal ?
marketing executive : . i really how it works . but maybe you can show us first ?
project manager : drawing goes with this thing . do not touch your hand on this little thingy here . that is important . so hold it like this .
marketing executive : you g you get electrocuted or
project manager : kinda . so , you must p push a little good . because and a few seconds . it is not fully real - time , so watch it .
user interface designer : ach .
project manager : i am gonna paint in the red .
user interface designer : ooph .
project manager : that is the background colour . , that is the one . my favourite animal ?
marketing executive : it is like pictionary ?
project manager : you can what it is .
marketing executive : the the one who says it first gets a raise .
project manager : may paint next .
marketing executive : it is a pork ?
project manager : no , it is not an orc . you do not see it at the ears ?
marketing executive : i have it at home .
project manager : you have an orc at home ?
user interface designer : very artistic .
project manager : it is a cat .
marketing executive : what is it called ?
project manager : simba . we have a cat at home and he is called simba . he looks like the lion from the lion king .
marketing executive : miniature size ?
project manager : so we found it kinda to name it after a lion . he is happy with us , so he is smiling .
user interface designer : he does have body .
project manager : no , only the face . because we have twen twenty five minutes . so we
marketing executive : we have to speed up . remember you use different colours , and different pen widths .
project manager : who wants to go next ?
marketing executive : i .
project manager : ? choose a colour , choose a pen width and draw a
user interface designer : you do not have to change the colour and the pen width during the drawing .
marketing executive : save it .
user interface designer : or
marketing executive : you have to save it .
project manager : save it , .
marketing executive : i have done it .
user interface designer : you have to draw push hard on the pen or
marketing executive : not really .
project manager : firm touch .
marketing executive : that one .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : ? which one is it ? i have speed up . , that is fine .
industrial designer : why was your cat red ?
project manager : because my cat is red at home .
industrial designer : .
project manager : and i have red hair , so must be red .
user interface designer : it is a very bloody cat .
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : it is a frog .
industrial designer : no , it is a turtle .
user interface designer : it is an apple .
marketing executive : it is not an apple .
industrial designer : must be a dog .
user interface designer : a dog ?
marketing executive : . something like this .
user interface designer : ? , it is a turtle .
project manager : it is a turtle .
marketing executive : i liked teenage mutant hero turtles .
project manager : you watched it a lot ?
user interface designer : it is inside its shell . you will be finished sooner .
marketing executive : no , it is
project manager : it is a scared turtle .

marketing executive : something like this . , very artistic .
project manager : jurgen , you want to go next ?
user interface designer : yes . wha
marketing executive : here you go .
user interface designer : how did it work ?
project manager : format ? and then you have the current colour ,
user interface designer : performance ?
project manager : you can change . so no red or green .
user interface designer : and a pen ?
project manager : and line width . tim had tim , what kinda line width did you have ?
marketing executive : the big lines were like nine .
project manager : it is a dog .
user interface designer : very good . thought i would pick the easiest one .
project manager : why a dog ? you have a dog at home ?
user interface designer : we had a dog , a few years ago .
project manager : had a dog ?
marketing executive : it is p
user interface designer : and and it , when it died we did not get a new one . but
marketing executive : it is pretty good
project manager : you have an artistic inner middle .
marketing executive : an artist .
user interface designer : a graphical user designer , so hey .
marketing executive : think you picked the wrong function .
user interface designer : no . can work together .
project manager : so you can see it is real really a easy programme to use . not difficult .
marketing executive : wha
user interface designer : it is .
marketing executive : that is enough ,
project manager : janus ?
marketing executive : i wonder .
project manager : after a cat , a turtle and a dog . he is gonna draw an elephant .
industrial designer : i figure i should do something like that , but i am gonna do something much more difficult .
project manager : uh - oh .
user interface designer : uh - oh . he is the artistic design .
marketing executive : i am gonna design a remote control animal .
user interface designer : remote control animal .
industrial designer : exactly .
user interface designer : with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there .
marketing executive : that that might be easier . but at the other hand , a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , and
project manager : no .
marketing executive : it is easier to draw .
project manager : better to draw with a with
marketing executive : . with a pen than with a mouse .
user interface designer : than on the , with i m like on here , drawing . and then displaying on screen , but
marketing executive : mouth . w with this paper it is too mu too expensive .
project manager : but what is he ?
user interface designer : too expensive , .
project manager : is it a rabbit ?
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : do you have a rabbit at home ?
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : it is a rabbit with broken legs ?
user interface designer : a green rabbit .
project manager : is it a white rabbit f it is the white rabbit from the matrix .
industrial designer : exactly .
project manager : then .
user interface designer : there , the g white green rabbit .
industrial designer : so .
user interface designer : he is a little bit stoned there .
industrial designer : i figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : uh .
project manager : finishing touch and then we are going further .
marketing executive : project manager ?
industrial designer : where does the pen go ? just
marketing executive : have you been counting the time ?
project manager : a little .
marketing executive : let is go on then .
project manager : the dog is the most artistic .
industrial designer : i figured the rabbit was actually the most impressive .
project manager : do not choose for youself . that is selfish . now we are gonna dig into the to the serious .
marketing executive : it is pretty abstract .
project manager : the selling price for the remote will be twenty five euro , and the production cost may not be more than twenty and a half euro . from my point of view , i do not think it is gonna be very high tech , high definition , ultra modern kinda remote , for twelve fift twelve and a half euro . the profit we must make with the new remote is fifty million euro . so that is a lot . we have to sell a lot of
user interface designer : how much is it ?
marketing executive : like how much ?
user interface designer : hundred million remotes ?
project manager : w when the selling price is twenty five , you got two million , two million remotes .
industrial designer : twenty million . two million , two million .
project manager : but our marketing range is , market range is international . so we have virtually the whole world we can sell our r remotes to . at least that countries which have a television . now it is time for us to going to discuss a little things . you can think about experience with a remote control yourself , at home . what you think might be a useful new feature . what what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . let is discuss a little . i am gonna join you at the table . what is the most important thing at a remote control ?
user interface designer : the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . and my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible .
project manager : so not a remote control who which can be used for television and a d_v_d _ and radio and or just only
marketing executive : . but i have some points . can i show them on the big screen ?
project manager : if you have them on
marketing executive : .
project manager : in case you want it this is a dead fly . between the , the
marketing executive : screen ?
project manager : be the screens .
user interface designer : is it possible to open pen drawings in this on this screen ?
project manager : only all the drawings go there , at the left
user interface designer : but which the ones we made on the
project manager : that pen drawings . no , when it is in word and you have saved it in the shared documents folder , you can show it there .
user interface designer : only in word ,
marketing executive : i have some points from marketing point of view . just the standard thing li things like intuitive , small , fairly cheap . it is pretty cheap , twenty five euros . brand independent . , it does not have to matter which brand your t_v _ or other thing is .
project manager : five minutes .
marketing executive : five minutes ? i will wrap it up quickly . i personally think it has to be multi - purpose . most of the remote c remote controls are just for one purpose . and by making it multi - purpose , it has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from current products .
project manager :  .
marketing executive : maybe some other technology than infrared . i rather find it very annoying , like when someone is standing in front of the t_v _ then you ca not switch it . think about sending it over radio waves or bluetooth . that might be a little bit expensive . and something like an l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer : for what purpose ?

project manager : uh - oh .
user interface designer : uh - oh . he is the artistic design .
marketing executive : i am gonna design a remote control animal .
user interface designer : remote control animal .
industrial designer : exactly .
user interface designer : with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there .
marketing executive : that that might be easier . but at the other hand , a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , and
project manager : no .
marketing executive : it is easier to draw .
project manager : better to draw with a with
marketing executive : . with a pen than with a mouse .
user interface designer : than on the , with i m like on here , drawing . and then displaying on screen , but
marketing executive : mouth . w with this paper it is too mu too expensive .
project manager : but what is he ?
user interface designer : too expensive , .
project manager : is it a rabbit ?
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : do you have a rabbit at home ?
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : it is a rabbit with broken legs ?
user interface designer : a green rabbit .
project manager : is it a white rabbit f it is the white rabbit from the matrix .
industrial designer : exactly .
project manager : then .
user interface designer : there , the g white green rabbit .
industrial designer : so .
user interface designer : he is a little bit stoned there .
industrial designer : i figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : uh .
project manager : finishing touch and then we are going further .
marketing executive : project manager ?
industrial designer : where does the pen go ? just
marketing executive : have you been counting the time ?
project manager : a little .
marketing executive : let is go on then .
project manager : the dog is the most artistic .
industrial designer : i figured the rabbit was actually the most impressive .
project manager : do not choose for youself . that is selfish . now we are gonna dig into the to the serious .
marketing executive : it is pretty abstract .
project manager : the selling price for the remote will be twenty five euro , and the production cost may not be more than twenty and a half euro . from my point of view , i do not think it is gonna be very high tech , high definition , ultra modern kinda remote , for twelve fift twelve and a half euro . the profit we must make with the new remote is fifty million euro . so that is a lot . we have to sell a lot of
user interface designer : how much is it ?
marketing executive : like how much ?
user interface designer : hundred million remotes ?
project manager : w when the selling price is twenty five , you got two million , two million remotes .
industrial designer : twenty million . two million , two million .
project manager : but our marketing range is , market range is international . so we have virtually the whole world we can sell our r remotes to . at least that countries which have a television . now it is time for us to going to discuss a little things . you can think about experience with a remote control yourself , at home . what you think might be a useful new feature . what what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . let is discuss a little . i am gonna join you at the table . what is the most important thing at a remote control ?
user interface designer : the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . and my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible .
project manager : so not a remote control who which can be used for television and a d_v_d _ and radio and or just only
marketing executive : . but i have some points . can i show them on the big screen ?
project manager : if you have them on
marketing executive : .
project manager : in case you want it this is a dead fly . between the , the
marketing executive : screen ?
project manager : be the screens .
user interface designer : is it possible to open pen drawings in this on this screen ?
project manager : only all the drawings go there , at the left
user interface designer : but which the ones we made on the
project manager : that pen drawings . no , when it is in word and you have saved it in the shared documents folder , you can show it there .
user interface designer : only in word ,
marketing executive : i have some points from marketing point of view . just the standard thing li things like intuitive , small , fairly cheap . it is pretty cheap , twenty five euros . brand independent . , it does not have to matter which brand your t_v _ or other thing is .
project manager : five minutes .
marketing executive : five minutes ? i will wrap it up quickly . i personally think it has to be multi - purpose . most of the remote c remote controls are just for one purpose . and by making it multi - purpose , it has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from current products .
project manager :  .
marketing executive : maybe some other technology than infrared . i rather find it very annoying , like when someone is standing in front of the t_v _ then you ca not switch it . think about sending it over radio waves or bluetooth . that might be a little bit expensive . and something like an l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer : for what purpose ?
marketing executive : like i said here maybe it is easy . it is as an added feature , that , when you are on a certain channel , you can see on the l_c_d _ screen what programmes are coming up or
project manager : so it be a multi - purpose very technically high

project manager : a little .
marketing executive : let is go on then .
project manager : the dog is the most artistic .
industrial designer : i figured the rabbit was actually the most impressive .
project manager : do not choose for youself . that is selfish . now we are gonna dig into the to the serious .
marketing executive : it is pretty abstract .
project manager : the selling price for the remote will be twenty five euro , and the production cost may not be more than twenty and a half euro . from my point of view , i do not think it is gonna be very high tech , high definition , ultra modern kinda remote , for twelve fift twelve and a half euro . the profit we must make with the new remote is fifty million euro . so that is a lot . we have to sell a lot of
user interface designer : how much is it ?
marketing executive : like how much ?
user interface designer : hundred million remotes ?
project manager : w when the selling price is twenty five , you got two million , two million remotes .
industrial designer : twenty million . two million , two million .
project manager : but our marketing range is , market range is international . so we have virtually the whole world we can sell our r remotes to . at least that countries which have a television . now it is time for us to going to discuss a little things . you can think about experience with a remote control yourself , at home . what you think might be a useful new feature . what what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . let is discuss a little . i am gonna join you at the table . what is the most important thing at a remote control ?
user interface designer : the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . and my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible .
project manager : so not a remote control who which can be used for television and a d_v_d _ and radio and or just only
marketing executive : . but i have some points . can i show them on the big screen ?
project manager : if you have them on
marketing executive : .
project manager : in case you want it this is a dead fly . between the , the
marketing executive : screen ?
project manager : be the screens .
user interface designer : is it possible to open pen drawings in this on this screen ?
project manager : only all the drawings go there , at the left
user interface designer : but which the ones we made on the
project manager : that pen drawings . no , when it is in word and you have saved it in the shared documents folder , you can show it there .
user interface designer : only in word ,
marketing executive : i have some points from marketing point of view . just the standard thing li things like intuitive , small , fairly cheap . it is pretty cheap , twenty five euros . brand independent . , it does not have to matter which brand your t_v _ or other thing is .
project manager : five minutes .
marketing executive : five minutes ? i will wrap it up quickly . i personally think it has to be multi - purpose . most of the remote c remote controls are just for one purpose . and by making it multi - purpose , it has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from current products .
project manager :  .
marketing executive : maybe some other technology than infrared . i rather find it very annoying , like when someone is standing in front of the t_v _ then you ca not switch it . think about sending it over radio waves or bluetooth . that might be a little bit expensive . and something like an l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer : for what purpose ?
marketing executive : like i said here maybe it is easy . it is as an added feature , that , when you are on a certain channel , you can see on the l_c_d _ screen what programmes are coming up or
project manager : so it be a multi - purpose very technically high
marketing executive : from my point of view , .
project manager : remote ? it must be really innovative , technical - wise ?
marketing executive : it has to be our company is very good in making new innovative things .

user interface designer : we
marketing executive : so i
project manager : so we must focus on things who are really add something to
marketing executive : to the current market . look , you got some cheap remote controls there . they just you got a dozen of 'em . but when you enter a new market with a remote control and wanna gain market share you have to do something special , .
project manager : but we have to keep an eye that it is at the beginning of such a project , it is very to talk about , this would be , that would be . but we must not lose sight of the user friendly
user interface designer : and and the price .

user interface designer : consensus on the , what we are gonna do .

project manager : uh - oh .
user interface designer : uh - oh . he is the artistic design .
marketing executive : i am gonna design a remote control animal .
user interface designer : remote control animal .
industrial designer : exactly .
user interface designer : with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there .
marketing executive : that that might be easier . but at the other hand , a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , and
project manager : no .
marketing executive : it is easier to draw .
project manager : better to draw with a with
marketing executive : . with a pen than with a mouse .
user interface designer : than on the , with i m like on here , drawing . and then displaying on screen , but
marketing executive : mouth . w with this paper it is too mu too expensive .
project manager : but what is he ?
user interface designer : too expensive , .
project manager : is it a rabbit ?
industrial designer : yes .
project manager : do you have a rabbit at home ?
industrial designer : no .
marketing executive : it is a rabbit with broken legs ?
user interface designer : a green rabbit .
project manager : is it a white rabbit f it is the white rabbit from the matrix .
industrial designer : exactly .
project manager : then .
user interface designer : there , the g white green rabbit .
industrial designer : so .
user interface designer : he is a little bit stoned there .
industrial designer : i figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit .
marketing executive : .
industrial designer : uh .
project manager : finishing touch and then we are going further .
marketing executive : project manager ?
industrial designer : where does the pen go ? just
marketing executive : have you been counting the time ?
project manager : a little .
marketing executive : let is go on then .
project manager : the dog is the most artistic .
industrial designer : i figured the rabbit was actually the most impressive .
project manager : do not choose for youself . that is selfish . now we are gonna dig into the to the serious .
marketing executive : it is pretty abstract .
project manager : the selling price for the remote will be twenty five euro , and the production cost may not be more than twenty and a half euro . from my point of view , i do not think it is gonna be very high tech , high definition , ultra modern kinda remote , for twelve fift twelve and a half euro . the profit we must make with the new remote is fifty million euro . so that is a lot . we have to sell a lot of
user interface designer : how much is it ?
marketing executive : like how much ?
user interface designer : hundred million remotes ?
project manager : w when the selling price is twenty five , you got two million , two million remotes .
industrial designer : twenty million . two million , two million .
project manager : but our marketing range is , market range is international . so we have virtually the whole world we can sell our r remotes to . at least that countries which have a television . now it is time for us to going to discuss a little things . you can think about experience with a remote control yourself , at home . what you think might be a useful new feature . what what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . let is discuss a little . i am gonna join you at the table . what is the most important thing at a remote control ?
user interface designer : the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . and my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible .
project manager : so not a remote control who which can be used for television and a d_v_d _ and radio and or just only
marketing executive : . but i have some points . can i show them on the big screen ?
project manager : if you have them on
marketing executive : .
project manager : in case you want it this is a dead fly . between the , the
marketing executive : screen ?
project manager : be the screens .
user interface designer : is it possible to open pen drawings in this on this screen ?
project manager : only all the drawings go there , at the left
user interface designer : but which the ones we made on the
project manager : that pen drawings . no , when it is in word and you have saved it in the shared documents folder , you can show it there .
user interface designer : only in word ,
marketing executive : i have some points from marketing point of view . just the standard thing li things like intuitive , small , fairly cheap . it is pretty cheap , twenty five euros . brand independent . , it does not have to matter which brand your t_v _ or other thing is .
project manager : five minutes .
marketing executive : five minutes ? i will wrap it up quickly . i personally think it has to be multi - purpose . most of the remote c remote controls are just for one purpose . and by making it multi - purpose , it has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from current products .
project manager :  .
marketing executive : maybe some other technology than infrared . i rather find it very annoying , like when someone is standing in front of the t_v _ then you ca not switch it . think about sending it over radio waves or bluetooth . that might be a little bit expensive . and something like an l_c_d _ screen .
user interface designer : for what purpose ?
marketing executive : like i said here maybe it is easy . it is as an added feature , that , when you are on a certain channel , you can see on the l_c_d _ screen what programmes are coming up or
project manager : so it be a multi - purpose very technically high
marketing executive : from my point of view , .
project manager : remote ? it must be really innovative , technical - wise ?
marketing executive : it has to be our company is very good in making new innovative things .
project manager : i agree with you .
user interface designer : we
marketing executive : so i
project manager : so we must focus on things who are really add something to
marketing executive : to the current market . look , you got some cheap remote controls there . they just you got a dozen of 'em . but when you enter a new market with a remote control and wanna gain market share you have to do something special , .
project manager : but we have to keep an eye that it is at the beginning of such a project , it is very to talk about , this would be , that would be . but we must not lose sight of the user friendly
user interface designer : and and the price .
marketing executive : but it is but but this is just from marketing aspect .
project manager : .
marketing executive : i anything about user interface or design .
project manager : and that is because we have him .
industrial designer : and and him .
user interface designer : and him .
project manager : next meeting will start in thirty minutes . you will have individual actions where i presume will be some feedback , via the m the mail . the industrial designer has to look at the working design . the user interface designer has to look at the technical functions . that is the thing we discussed .
user interface designer : one thing , we must first agree on what we are going to m going to make . do we are we going to use it for multiple systems ? we should have some agreement on that before we
project manager : wha
marketing executive : i do not think we have to be , we have to agree on that .
industrial designer : i figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually .
marketing executive : th that is a pha that is a phase further . ju just make some mock - ups , some general ideas . and and then we can plan we can plan further , .
project manager : but maybe , because you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , we must have a little or kinda how do you call it ?
user interface designer : consensus on the , what we are gonna do .
project manager : a little plan on what we are going to do . so you do not come up with the user requirements who do not fit the technical functions . some basic things we co we want to going to do . will come in handy .
marketing executive : you decide . you are the project manager .
project manager : w he says
user interface designer : if the technical functions have to be designed , i have got ta know for what machines they will be . or do we use it a text screen ? or will it be with bluetooth or
project manager : th that is really a step further . but if you say is it one way or multi - purpose , that is a
user interface designer :  .
marketing executive : tha that is a same step further .
project manager : why ?
industrial designer : actually it is . then looking at individual components , so that is actually a f step further .
marketing executive : like we all have a list of things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . and then in the next meeting we decide
industrial designer : we can take it from there .
marketing executive : w what it is gonna be .
industrial designer : i agree ,
marketing executive : a and then you s then you can delete
industrial designer : or edit .
marketing executive : the o the obsolete details .
project manager : each individually i individually must think on what is at his point of view is the most important . and then we are going to fit all the pieces together the next meeting . i must finish off now , so it is over . you will receive specific instructions by your personal coach . and i see you in thirty minutes .
industrial designer : cheers .
project manager : be careful .
marketing executive : damn .

marketing executive : speaks for itself .
project manager : thing it speaks for itself . and as you may have heard , the documents in the shared folder can be showed on this screen . not in y the my documents . so if you wanna show something , put it in the shared folder . this is very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . i do not gonna explain it all , because how it works . we must not forget everything we draw on here , all must be saved . we we may not delete anything . so if you have drawn something , save it . never delete it . that is a very important thing . little kinda exercise to know each other . at the white board on the left . every every one of us must draw our favourite animal , and tell us why we had chosen that animal . important is that we use different colours , and different pen widths .
marketing executive : i have a question .

industrial designer : hi .
project manager : hi .
industrial designer : i see my bunny is still standing . no one drawing it .
project manager : it is too beautiful .
user interface designer : true .
industrial designer : i figured that much .
marketing executive : too wicked .
project manager : a minute , my laptop is , there it is , so welcome back . at the functional design meeting the plan is that each one of you , so not me but only you will present the things you worked on the last half hour . i will take minutes and will put the minutes that i have at the end of the session in the shared folder . also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that now or afterwards . i had an email from the management board , i if you a al also received it , but there were four points which are very important . first one is they think that teletext becomes outdated and internet will be the main focus . second one is also important , because it is one of the discussion points of the previous session . the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it not gonna it is not gonna be a multi - purpose remote control , so that is one thing to keep in mind . second , and that is important for the marketing expert , the current customers are in the age group of forty years and older , but with this new remote they will would like to reach a group younger than forty . and to keep in mind , but not really for now is that they want the slogan and the logo to be recognised more in the remote . so , we have forty minutes , so not more than ten minutes per presentation each , and use all the facilities so that you have either smartboards , the word files , what you whatever you want . tim , can you start ?
marketing executive : welcome . i have some new findings on marketing expert level ,
user interface designer :  .
marketing executive : which i will show you . the method i used was giving orders to our usability lab to do a questionnaire . one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing department generated a report with a lot of results . , these were a couple of findings , first page of three . , we have three audiences of two audiences , i am . the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age . the second one is from sixty four forty six to sixty five . , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent sixty five . second audience is thirty five percent . and some interests from the age groups , it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy new technology , like an l_c_d _ screen on the remote control , speech recognition . i do not think that is really appropriate . , and when you see the audience , the age is going up , they do not really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . second findings out of the questionnaire are the opinion the opinions of the audience about current remote controls . first point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . so that is maybe something for the user interface designer . third findings . according to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , following buttons are most important . , i will tell something about the way this test was , done . , persons were asked what the buttons were they use most , how much an hour ,
project manager :  .
marketing executive : and in the second table the importance of those buttons . , when you multiply them , you get the these three points . switching channels , that is pretty normal , that is what you do with a remote control . the second , teletext , and the third , volume controls . , it is good that we the user want wants , at least the these three points have to be very clear .
project manager : but it is strange that the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be outdated by the internet . so that is strange .
marketing executive : . , but at the moment teletext is , th the best thing you can get on t_v _ , like getting information .
project manager : .
marketing executive : so , when you ask people , what do they use , they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control . that is ridiculous . that is a ne i it it is a new technology , but it is not incorporated right now . my personal preferences . , we should aim at the audience from sixteen to forty five . , first of all it is the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . second , you will get the most revenue from i from it . people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of t_v _ , more than people who are el elder . second point , we have to impro improve the most used functions , as i said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . third point that came out of the questionnaire , people used to get lost off the remote controller , so maybe it is an idea for us to design ex placeholder on side of the , of the t_v _
project manager : that is a idea .
marketing executive : where you can put the remote control in . , that is about it , .
industrial designer : when you mentioned improving functions , what do you mean by that what are you think about ?
marketing executive : not the r not the functions ,
industrial designer : the funtionability .
marketing executive : but it came out that a lot of buttons were not even used on a remote control . so you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds of buttons , but if you do not use them , it is
industrial designer : so focusing more on the used buttons .
marketing executive : they have to be on it j just to t to get it done if necessary , but the most used buttons have to be bigger or
industrial designer : could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function .
marketing executive : perhaps . just for the minor functions perhaps .
industrial designer : ma perhaps , just an idea .
marketing executive : just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn .
project manager : tim . janus , can you
industrial designer : i will go , . right , i will be explaining a bit about working design about the project . what i did was i dissected current remote controls and i viewed how they w looked , how they worked , what components are involved , and how they are connected together . and after that i put up a scheme about how these things are organised and i will show it to you in a few seconds . and i will explain a bit about how it works and how we could build one and why several possibilities that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . what i did was i checked remote controls and the remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . and the thing about that is the remote controls have to act as a t_v _ or a stereo , and those have a transmitter that is also focused on infrared , so if we want to build a remote control with bluetooth then the t_v _ should have bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus that is that would not mean a cheap remote control for us . so that is probably why most controls are still infrared . furthermore they all have a very simple structure , so that would probably mean lower costs and i that could mean for us a good thing we should be able to build a relatively cheap a cheap remote . as i mentioned ready , we have some bluetooth it may be possible , but i figured it would not be possible in within our budget , but that is not for me to decide , but that is maybe something for marketing to look into . f because my personal opinion is not to do bluetooth or radio waves , although
marketing executive : what do you think about incorporating bluetooth or a radio receiver in the place - holder next to the t_v _ , connected to the t_v _ ?
industrial designer : actually i have t
marketing executive : so it is in the wrong product .
industrial designer : . , i actually i figured that would be rather , but then you would still have the infrared function . so in theory you would actually just move the problem , but what i did think about was when you mentioned about the cup - holder , is why not introduce a speech function like where is the remote . if somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes beep , maybe something to look into , what the cost that something like that would be . but it may be something to explore . i will just explain a bit of the components . first you have the energy source . the energy source would be a battery , simple battery that you can find anywhere . i figured that would be best , when the battery stops functioning we could just use you could just go out and buy a new one . so we did not and we do not have to do all to be too complicated about that . the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but the infrared button works only via the chip and the subcomponent to the switch there is a switch between these . when the switch is pressed in a w on this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , a electric current goes through here , and in immediately , a l a bulb lights up displaying to the user that something has happened . that is that is so the h user wo not be thinking , did the button be pressed , w what happened . or i press button but nothing is happening on the t_v _ , so is something wrong . so that is just to explain the of to make it clearer to the user . w the signal goes via chip that is translated into electric sig electronic signals and then it is processed and then it is sent to the infrared bulb where it will be received on the receiving end . and those interpreted by the device , in this case the television . my personal preferences here , we have to keep it simple . not too many gadgets and functions , just like you said the most users n you have a lot of buttons and you u use you do not use them , so why should we invent w spend more time on those . we should stick by with infrared transmitting and no receiving . so no input from the television . we should not be spending time on teletext and st things like that , because when you want teletext on infrared you would have to build in a receiver too , and so in order to receive the signals from what is on t_v _ and such . i figure that would be spending too much money and time
marketing executive : maybe another problem , current t_v_s can even send infrared .
industrial designer : yes , but what should we s i f i agree with you , but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the remote control ? that would be extra components , extra designs , larger g remote control .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : these all that we have to take in account . so i my personal opinion is no receiver . we should look into the design and the functionability . like i said , use one button for m multiple functions , or just hide the few buttons o of switching it open , the usual . and do not overbuild , we should not make a big remote control for simple functions , but we should stick to the basics . so that was my personal opinion . and that was my presentation
project manager : janus .
user interface designer : yes ,
project manager : you do ?
user interface designer : go ahead .
project manager : the last presentation . you have plenty of time ,
user interface designer : last presentation .
project manager : tim and janus do not talk to ten minutes , so take your time . if you take your time too long i will eventually warn you .
user interface designer : i am going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and usability functions . what is my opinion about what is most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , so if you going to design a remote that looks good , that should not weigh over the if it is possible to make , but also the user friendliness , so tha that is some of the main points . and another one is the use of many functions will make it more difficult , so use as little functions as possible or at least do not display them all at once on the same remote . if you have fifty functions you do not want fifty buttons t to be shown at the same time , when you visit an internet site you do not want fifty links to see , but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy structure . and one of the ideas was maybe use touch screen , but s i in how far that is possible , since we are sticking to infrared and the remote can not receive anything , but we might consider that . i hope this is all clear to you . if you can use remote like this with all the functions , many functions , but , your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this . you have to be very careful what you push , and if you are looking for teletext you will be searching for half an hour from where is it ? where the hell he here i and , when you have to use something else . so just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use . if you want to use a play and back and stop , that is very important . this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but it is no longer applying . i prefer to use it only for t_v _ and n not to give too many options and if possible , the buttons should give a dr direct action , not first select
project manager : you just said you wanted to combine more functions in one , you want to keep it simple ,
user interface designer : and so that is where the difficulties lie .
industrial designer : but
project manager : but that if you want to do that , then you ca not escape the fact that there will be buttons which give s more options than one .
user interface designer : this so that is the thing you have to weigh against each other . do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or multi - purpose as we thought , or do we want to use many buttons . so weighing those factors .
marketing executive : it is maybe an option if you use an l_c_d _ or a touch screen , that in the middle are the main keys , like displayed on the
user interface designer : the does not .
marketing executive : this ? something like that . just in the middle the general functions , like play , channel switching , and then at the top or at the bottom , some menus like settings or that you can drop down .
user interface designer : but when all the questions i had do we want to use a menu display on the t_v _ ? or does have to f everything be in remotes ? if you use a memory display on the t_v _ , you can simply push a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press . so that is my recommendation , if you use many options in one buttle button , display the menu on the t_v _
marketing executive : nah .
user interface designer : and do not use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , is too complicated for most users .
marketing executive : so too , but and that is partly because a lot of t_v_s have different menus , and when you have a particular menu at your device , it could be that do not correspond to the menu what is actually on t_v _ .
user interface designer : that will be a problem .
industrial designer : you d you have to keep in mind that several t_v_s do not even have a menu structure , or they have a very simple menu structure , so you have to keep in mind that not all d not our remote wo not be able to work on all televisions .
user interface designer : yes .
industrial designer : and that would be a considerable problem .
user interface designer : if we have to stick with current technologies and , the restrictions of what is is on the market today , you should keep it s at this . use big clear buttons . so maybe we will loose a few option options , but i this is more important . especially the important buttons , if you want to switch channel , change your volume , use teletext , it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind a little thing or a touch screen .
industrial designer : not embed but then with something like a touch screen could make more menu up pop up .
user interface designer : and , if you want to s put on stand - by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do . not first change menu options or switch something . , as you already told , give some feedback . if the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low . and , my conclusion is less is more , keep it simple . maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to keep it accessible on t because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the television , some you will never know and never use , and therefore it is important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions that are not so important you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they are not in the way for the most important functions .
marketing executive : . , the idea about touch screen is very good . , because recently i saw news item on t_v _ about new telephones for elder people . , they have like a touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hang - up , and that is a big ad advantage , because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures . it is very visual intended . what was i to say more ?
user interface designer : maybe that is an option . keep the primary buttons visible . make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues , put a logo on it and maybe use it in some aesthetic form . but th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen , or if that is will become too difficult just like televi some o older telephones use a l maybe it is possible to flip them open and just expand the number of options that are normally visible .
marketing executive : but if you pick the idea , the left idea then what is gonna be displayed on the touch screen ?
industrial designer : the extra functions .
user interface designer : the extra functions , you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one ,
marketing executive : but l like menu functions or
user interface designer : and then all the options will become available and you just c s t scroll through them .
industrial designer : would not it be better to make just one big touch screen , one small touch screen applet
marketing executive : so .
industrial designer : and i will just make let is say fifteen buttons on it , and we have three of those , actually just menus with sub - menus , with or sub - items , sub - functions .
user interface designer : then i would like to make a proposal . if you make one big touch screen ,
industrial designer : yes .
user interface designer : use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest .
industrial designer : like the ipod idea that we just saw . you just have a f a few selected buttons and a few menus , and with this idea you could actually make several you can also improve later on . that will be great .
project manager : so you think it is will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen .
industrial designer : i wou i would actually go for the
project manager : jirun ?
user interface designer : i agree , but it is very important that they always make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen . and so an elder designer picks up th the of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who is all in the systems functions , you will have to have the possibility to turn off the t_v _ or to switch the channel without using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions .
marketing executive : i had another idea about maybe parental control . , like building in some pin code which allows parents to switch to all channels , but children if children the pin code , they ca not switch to violent channels or
user interface designer : wh is that possible to use or no ?
industrial designer : that is possible , that actually depends on the television ,
marketing executive : th there is just
industrial designer : but i figure that would be
user interface designer : does it have to depend on the television ?
marketing executive : ju just a simple log - in , something like that .
industrial designer : y you s you see the fi thing is when you buy a remote , you set the channels , the channels are different on each te television , they are not set in a preset order , if you lock on a remote , let is say channel fifteen , channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television , so that would be actually the main concern .
project manager : .
user interface designer : that he means that maybe by some option make that remote control and the t_v _ match , and then after that you can use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children can not use this change the settings of the t_v _ , like colour and then volume and
marketing executive : th that , but maybe if you log in first as a parent , you address the channels and like , that is channel fifteen , that is vi violent channel ,
user interface designer : something like that .
marketing executive : m my ki my kids i do not want my kids to watch that , then you set the priority to only parents ,
user interface designer : b but make it a separate option in the menu ,
industrial designer : that would b
marketing executive : but
industrial designer : that .
user interface designer : so that it is dif dis displayed from displayed here ,
marketing executive : but , that is just
user interface designer : parents
marketing executive : that is an a an added feature .
project manager : but let is not go too wide about the those things , that is that why we are here .
marketing executive : th those things are .
project manager : it is it is a idea , but that is we wel later in the stage . i have one little question about a total touch screen or a p
marketing executive : partial .
project manager : a partial , because elderly people may be not used to a touch screen , so they want the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , to be , kinda traditionals and the other functions , the more difficult functions to be maybe on the touch screen , but to keep this as normal as possible , to keep it accessible .
marketing executive : but if you display it on l_c_d _ screen with r really big numbers
user interface designer : you can de display it on the old style .
marketing executive : that is just as e just as easy .
industrial designer : . i do
user interface designer : you can display actual buttons on the touch screens .
project manager : . , that is true .
industrial designer : i do agree , because , it is just not the same when you touch a touch screen
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : or when you touch a button , but we have to look at what is our target audience .
marketing executive : it is different .
industrial designer : w we are aiming for younger people
project manager : that is true , .
industrial designer : and they chose
marketing executive : age b below forty .
project manager : that is a good point .
industrial designer : so that is probably a
marketing executive : and th those young people , . y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy ,
project manager : they like the fancy , .
marketing executive : so a touch screen , like microsoft al already developed something like that for multi - media applications . i th we can do that too .
project manager : . , as you can see the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are done .
marketing executive : done .
project manager : i have added the this four things from the management board just to keep in mind . each time i had a summary on what you told and what you personal think . so that can be read out . a f a few things i noticed were moment . th the main points in this meeting is how it is going to look with we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to have more options and have them hidden , so they do not you do not have a big thing full of buttons or and the point that you wanna use one controller for hypothetically each television , so you must the functions , know , like the menus or the parental control must be all by the done by the remote control and not by the television . that is the point what we discussed .
marketing executive : some of them . the menus are not identical for all th for all t_v_s , so you have to display it on one t_v _ .
user interface designer : you can use when you how do you call it , s synchronized , the remote and the t_v _ ,
marketing executive : but that is not possible .
user interface designer : then there is always , there are always possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume
marketing executive :  , .
user interface designer : and maybe we can look out if there is options that the remote in its memory can see what kinda t_v _ it is , it is a philips , this and that , and then give the options that are capable the capable from the t
project manager : but you have an
marketing executive : add th that is an opportunity .
project manager : but you have an international market range , so you have a big range of
user interface designer : there are universal d remotes and they all have a functionality for all the t_v_s , so this would not be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these .
industrial designer : but they
project manager : and it is not too complex to do it .
industrial designer : they all have to be programmed to fit your t_v _
marketing executive : no .
industrial designer : and that is bit of a tricky job . i actually use one of those when they are they are kinda troublesome , but whe when you start building something like this you have to build a receiver into the t into the remotes , because in order for the remote to process something from the t_v _ , like to synchronise and you have to send and receive ,
user interface designer :  . mo
industrial designer : and that is
marketing executive : no no .
user interface designer : no , you can just say the c
marketing executive : he he me he means just one other thing .
project manager : just build it in .
marketing executive : with the current remote controls , the universal ones , you have to press a code for t_v _ .
user interface designer : in codes , y you get a b a book with codes . you look up , i have a philips h _ fifty five and it says press code four five
industrial designer : ,
user interface designer : and you press code four five on the in the remote and it displays all your menu options .
industrial designer : that would be possible , .
marketing executive : now we just connect the t_v _ type to a set of options , in just in the memory ,
user interface designer : memory in the remote .
industrial designer : profiles .
marketing executive : so that if you , like profile , so that if you touch in like one four one zero t_v _ the memory pops up the options .
industrial designer : . , that would be possible .
marketing executive : i th do not think that is that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables .
industrial designer : no , that would not be , a few variables .
user interface designer : if you look at the manuals from universal remotes , there are maybe three four hundreds t_v_s at maximum . if you have all of them , all the old and new t_v_s summed up , it is possible .
industrial designer : it is . it is definitely po
marketing executive : but , on the other hand , if you have a remote and buy a new t_v _ that is not incorporated in the remote
project manager : we have five minutes to go .
user interface designer : then you have to buy a new one , it is very good for marketing
marketing executive : new remote ?
user interface designer : maybe , or an update , software update .
marketing executive : a firmware upgrade ,
user interface designer : firmware update , you say .
industrial designer : firmware upgrade .
marketing executive : but from where ? maybe w
industrial designer : that is maybe the cup holder .
marketing executive : no m may no , maybe we can incorporate some u_s_b _ or a firewire connection , so that you can connect it to the p_c _ and download the newest firmware from the internet .
industrial designer : not everybody has a p_c _ at home . the most people have ,
user interface designer : at
industrial designer : but not everybody
user interface designer : you can go back to the shop and they
marketing executive : like a s service centre .
user interface designer : ser o
industrial designer : maybe something like service cen
user interface designer : and they can download it for you .
industrial designer : or you could s actually look at the place - holder you talked about earlier , and you could probably make a connection to an telephone line or a internet connection .
user interface designer : already digital information is sent t to the standards , t_v _ connections , you can see what is programme is on the new channels , so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard t_v _
industrial designer : then it is be back to the building a receiving if it is actually worth it to build it in ,
user interface designer : receiving .
industrial designer : we could actually look at into it , but , it would be bringing more costs with it
user interface designer : difficult .
marketing executive : it is most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates at the service centre or at the shop .
user interface designer : s some it is good idea , .
industrial designer : that would be probably best , . like when you buy a t_v _ you just ask i will
marketing executive : it is it is not a lot of work , just one docking station where you put it in , press start , bling , updated .
industrial designer : that would be best , .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : you do not buy a t_v _ every week , new teev so .
user interface designer : let is save this in the meanwhile
industrial designer : no no . exactly , so
user interface designer : m for which one are we going ?
marketing executive : let is vote .
user interface designer : that one or
industrial designer : my vote goes out to the right .
user interface designer : your vote and your
marketing executive : my vote too . and your vote ?
user interface designer : i was doubting about which one to take , but you have convinced me that if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal remote all elderly people will to do .
marketing executive : and also like a clapping li like device that pops open .
user interface designer : opens up is too difficult
industrial designer : flips open .
user interface designer : or
marketing executive : too difficult , maybe it is easier to break it .
project manager : n .
user interface designer : break it , i do not get
marketing executive : th that i
project manager : it is very sensitive .
user interface designer : so .
marketing executive : like my telephone , it is sensitive too .
project manager : it is almost at the end . so we have now a lunch break , finally , after the lunch break it is back to individual work , once again thirty minutes . i will put my minutes i have updated them so s they are updated in the shared folder too .
marketing executive : thirty minutes ?
project manager : thirty minutes , the
marketing executive : how minutes ?
project manager : failure . the specifi specific instructions for the next meeting you will all will receive at the email . i do not think say much about it , so for your email and hopefully you get it done in the thirty minutes , and i w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes .
marketing executive : one question , how late do we have to get back be back here ?
project manager : thirty minutes .
user interface designer : a quarter to one maybe ?
marketing executive : thirty minutes lunch break ?
project manager : thirty minutes lunch break , .
marketing executive : forty five .
project manager : then would it be one o'clock .
marketing executive : .
project manager : or we ask our personal coach . , that was a very good session , we
user interface designer : is it possible to store this on the share documents or what
marketing executive : me too .
project manager : ye
marketing executive : save as .
project manager : because all things are stored in smart board dot x_d_k _
marketing executive : v
project manager : and that is in
marketing executive : but but you can open a from your pr from your laptop .
user interface designer : save it as an image on the res
marketing executive : maybe .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : export . maybe not export function .
marketing executive : export . export h_t_m_l _ .
user interface designer : no , and use an image if possible .
marketing executive : image ?
user interface designer : j _ peg .
industrial designer : g _ , j _ peg .
user interface designer : j _ peg . , it is better
marketing executive : paper size a _ four . in this directory .
industrial designer : n .
user interface designer : it is not connected to the
project manager : you all have the questionnaire again about the after work .
user interface designer : to our p_c_s .
marketing executive : it is connected .
user interface designer : it is connected ?
project manager : deskt .
industrial designer : to room . i will just saved in my documents . in my own messenger .
project manager : project documents , .
user interface designer : it gives the na .
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : the questionnaire , fill in we fill out d after lunch or
project manager : it is simply filling no , it is also filling out i would do it after lunch .
industrial designer : aye , cheers .
project manager : i am hungry , so do it after lunch . you are welcome .
user interface designer : we can leave the p_c _ on , and return to the
project manager : i bring it to my personal room .
user interface designer : bring to i got ta bring it home .
marketing executive : to my exave executive
project manager : my executive big room with the panting .
user interface designer : a big office .
marketing executive : aye .",,"the project manager opened the meeting and had the marketing expert and user interface designer present new findings from a usability study . the marketing expert also discussed current findings from a survey which indicated that users want a fancier , less complicated remote control . the user interface designer presented two existing remote controls on the market , which the team later evaluated , and discussed what features in terms of appearance and functionality the remote the team is creating should include . the industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and presented options for components and materials which would keep costs low . the team then discussed the option to include speech recognition in their design . the project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to abide by . the industrial designer will work on the components concept . the user interface designer will work on the user interface concept . the marketing expert will work on trend watching the team will not work with teletext . the remote will only control televisions . the corporate image must be recognizable in the design of the remote . the remote will have buttons for the following functions: on and off , channel up and down , volume up and down , and entering channel numbers . the corporate logo must be recognizable in the design of the remote . the remote will have buttons for the following functions:",X,,X,X,,X,,,6.0,Pegasus-Cons

project manager : a minute , my laptop is , there it is , so welcome back . at the functional design meeting the plan is that each one of you , so not me but only you will present the things you worked on the last half hour . i will take minutes and will put the minutes that i have at the end of the session in the shared folder . also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that now or afterwards . i had an email from the management board , i if you a al also received it , but there were four points which are very important . first one is they think that teletext becomes outdated and internet will be the main focus . second one is also important , because it is one of the discussion points of the previous session . the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it not gonna it is not gonna be a multi - purpose remote control , so that is one thing to keep in mind . second , and that is important for the marketing expert , the current customers are in the age group of forty years and older , but with this new remote they will would like to reach a group younger than forty . and to keep in mind , but not really for now is that they want the slogan and the logo to be recognised more in the remote . so , we have forty minutes , so not more than ten minutes per presentation each , and use all the facilities so that you have either smartboards , the word files , what you whatever you want . tim , can you start ?
marketing executive : welcome . i have some new findings on marketing expert level ,
user interface designer :  .
marketing executive : which i will show you . the method i used was giving orders to our usability lab to do a questionnaire . one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing department generated a report with a lot of results . , these were a couple of findings , first page of three . , we have three audiences of two audiences , i am . the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age . the second one is from sixty four forty six to sixty five . , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent sixty five . second audience is thirty five percent . and some interests from the age groups , it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy new technology , like an l_c_d _ screen on the remote control , speech recognition . i do not think that is really appropriate . , and when you see the audience , the age is going up , they do not really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . second findings out of the questionnaire are the opinion the opinions of the audience about current remote controls . first point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . so that is maybe something for the user interface designer . third findings . according to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , following buttons are most important . , i will tell something about the way this test was , done . , persons were asked what the buttons were they use most , how much an hour ,
project manager :  .
marketing executive : and in the second table the importance of those buttons . , when you multiply them , you get the these three points . switching channels , that is pretty normal , that is what you do with a remote control . the second , teletext , and the third , volume controls . , it is good that we the user want wants , at least the these three points have to be very clear .
project manager : but it is strange that the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be outdated by the internet . so that is strange .
marketing executive : . , but at the moment teletext is , th the best thing you can get on t_v _ , like getting information .
project manager : .
marketing executive : so , when you ask people , what do they use , they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control . that is ridiculous . that is a ne i it it is a new technology , but it is not incorporated right now . my personal preferences . , we should aim at the audience from sixteen to forty five . , first of all it is the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . second , you will get the most revenue from i from it . people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of t_v _ , more than people who are el elder . second point , we have to impro improve the most used functions , as i said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . third point that came out of the questionnaire , people used to get lost off the remote controller , so maybe it is an idea for us to design ex placeholder on side of the , of the t_v _
project manager : that is a idea .
marketing executive : where you can put the remote control in . , that is about it , .
industrial designer : when you mentioned improving functions , what do you mean by that what are you think about ?
marketing executive : not the r not the functions ,
industrial designer : the funtionability .
marketing executive : but it came out that a lot of buttons were not even used on a remote control . so you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds of buttons , but if you do not use them , it is
industrial designer : so focusing more on the used buttons .
marketing executive : they have to be on it j just to t to get it done if necessary , but the most used buttons have to be bigger or
industrial designer : could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function .
marketing executive : perhaps . just for the minor functions perhaps .
industrial designer : ma perhaps , just an idea .
marketing executive : just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn .
project manager : tim . janus , can you
industrial designer : i will go , . right , i will be explaining a bit about working design about the project . what i did was i dissected current remote controls and i viewed how they w looked , how they worked , what components are involved , and how they are connected together . and after that i put up a scheme about how these things are organised and i will show it to you in a few seconds . and i will explain a bit about how it works and how we could build one and why several possibilities that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . what i did was i checked remote controls and the remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . and the thing about that is the remote controls have to act as a t_v _ or a stereo , and those have a transmitter that is also focused on infrared , so if we want to build a remote control with bluetooth then the t_v _ should have bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus that is that would not mean a cheap remote control for us . so that is probably why most controls are still infrared . furthermore they all have a very simple structure , so that would probably mean lower costs and i that could mean for us a good thing we should be able to build a relatively cheap a cheap remote . as i mentioned ready , we have some bluetooth it may be possible , but i figured it would not be possible in within our budget , but that is not for me to decide , but that is maybe something for marketing to look into . f because my personal opinion is not to do bluetooth or radio waves , although
marketing executive : what do you think about incorporating bluetooth or a radio receiver in the place - holder next to the t_v _ , connected to the t_v _ ?
industrial designer : actually i have t
marketing executive : so it is in the wrong product .
industrial designer : . , i actually i figured that would be rather , but then you would still have the infrared function . so in theory you would actually just move the problem , but what i did think about was when you mentioned about the cup - holder , is why not introduce a speech function like where is the remote . if somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes beep , maybe something to look into , what the cost that something like that would be . but it may be something to explore . i will just explain a bit of the components . first you have the energy source . the energy source would be a battery , simple battery that you can find anywhere . i figured that would be best , when the battery stops functioning we could just use you could just go out and buy a new one . so we did not and we do not have to do all to be too complicated about that . the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but the infrared button works only via the chip and the subcomponent to the switch there is a switch between these . when the switch is pressed in a w on this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , a electric current goes through here , and in immediately , a l a bulb lights up displaying to the user that something has happened . that is that is so the h user wo not be thinking , did the button be pressed , w what happened . or i press button but nothing is happening on the t_v _ , so is something wrong . so that is just to explain the of to make it clearer to the user . w the signal goes via chip that is translated into electric sig electronic signals and then it is processed and then it is sent to the infrared bulb where it will be received on the receiving end . and those interpreted by the device , in this case the television . my personal preferences here , we have to keep it simple . not too many gadgets and functions , just like you said the most users n you have a lot of buttons and you u use you do not use them , so why should we invent w spend more time on those . we should stick by with infrared transmitting and no receiving . so no input from the television . we should not be spending time on teletext and st things like that , because when you want teletext on infrared you would have to build in a receiver too , and so in order to receive the signals from what is on t_v _ and such . i figure that would be spending too much money and time
marketing executive : maybe another problem , current t_v_s can even send infrared .
industrial designer : yes , but what should we s i f i agree with you , but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the remote control ? that would be extra components , extra designs , larger g remote control .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : these all that we have to take in account . so i my personal opinion is no receiver . we should look into the design and the functionability . like i said , use one button for m multiple functions , or just hide the few buttons o of switching it open , the usual . and do not overbuild , we should not make a big remote control for simple functions , but we should stick to the basics . so that was my personal opinion . and that was my presentation
project manager : janus .
user interface designer : yes ,
project manager : you do ?
user interface designer : go ahead .
project manager : the last presentation . you have plenty of time ,
user interface designer : last presentation .
project manager : tim and janus do not talk to ten minutes , so take your time . if you take your time too long i will eventually warn you .
user interface designer : i am going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and usability functions . what is my opinion about what is most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , so if you going to design a remote that looks good , that should not weigh over the if it is possible to make , but also the user friendliness , so tha that is some of the main points . and another one is the use of many functions will make it more difficult , so use as little functions as possible or at least do not display them all at once on the same remote . if you have fifty functions you do not want fifty buttons t to be shown at the same time , when you visit an internet site you do not want fifty links to see , but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy structure . and one of the ideas was maybe use touch screen , but s i in how far that is possible , since we are sticking to infrared and the remote can not receive anything , but we might consider that . i hope this is all clear to you . if you can use remote like this with all the functions , many functions , but , your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this . you have to be very careful what you push , and if you are looking for teletext you will be searching for half an hour from where is it ? where the hell he here i and , when you have to use something else . so just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use . if you want to use a play and back and stop , that is very important . this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but it is no longer applying . i prefer to use it only for t_v _ and n not to give too many options and if possible , the buttons should give a dr direct action , not first select
project manager : you just said you wanted to combine more functions in one , you want to keep it simple ,
user interface designer : and so that is where the difficulties lie .
industrial designer : but
project manager : but that if you want to do that , then you ca not escape the fact that there will be buttons which give s more options than one .
user interface designer : this so that is the thing you have to weigh against each other . do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or multi - purpose as we thought , or do we want to use many buttons . so weighing those factors .
marketing executive : it is maybe an option if you use an l_c_d _ or a touch screen , that in the middle are the main keys , like displayed on the
user interface designer : the does not .
marketing executive : this ? something like that . just in the middle the general functions , like play , channel switching , and then at the top or at the bottom , some menus like settings or that you can drop down .
user interface designer : but when all the questions i had do we want to use a menu display on the t_v _ ? or does have to f everything be in remotes ? if you use a memory display on the t_v _ , you can simply push a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press . so that is my recommendation , if you use many options in one buttle button , display the menu on the t_v _
marketing executive : nah .
user interface designer : and do not use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , is too complicated for most users .
marketing executive : so too , but and that is partly because a lot of t_v_s have different menus , and when you have a particular menu at your device , it could be that do not correspond to the menu what is actually on t_v _ .
user interface designer : that will be a problem .
industrial designer : you d you have to keep in mind that several t_v_s do not even have a menu structure , or they have a very simple menu structure , so you have to keep in mind that not all d not our remote wo not be able to work on all televisions .
user interface designer : yes .
industrial designer : and that would be a considerable problem .
user interface designer : if we have to stick with current technologies and , the restrictions of what is is on the market today , you should keep it s at this . use big clear buttons . so maybe we will loose a few option options , but i this is more important . especially the important buttons , if you want to switch channel , change your volume , use teletext , it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind a little thing or a touch screen .
industrial designer : not embed but then with something like a touch screen could make more menu up pop up .
user interface designer : and , if you want to s put on stand - by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do . not first change menu options or switch something . , as you already told , give some feedback . if the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low . and , my conclusion is less is more , keep it simple . maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to keep it accessible on t because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the television , some you will never know and never use , and therefore it is important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions that are not so important you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they are not in the way for the most important functions .
marketing executive : . , the idea about touch screen is very good . , because recently i saw news item on t_v _ about new telephones for elder people . , they have like a touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hang - up , and that is a big ad advantage , because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures . it is very visual intended . what was i to say more ?
user interface designer : maybe that is an option . keep the primary buttons visible . make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues , put a logo on it and maybe use it in some aesthetic form . but th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen , or if that is will become too difficult just like televi some o older telephones use a l maybe it is possible to flip them open and just expand the number of options that are normally visible .
marketing executive : but if you pick the idea , the left idea then what is gonna be displayed on the touch screen ?
industrial designer : the extra functions .
user interface designer : the extra functions , you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one ,
marketing executive : but l like menu functions or
user interface designer : and then all the options will become available and you just c s t scroll through them .
industrial designer : would not it be better to make just one big touch screen , one small touch screen applet
marketing executive : so .
industrial designer : and i will just make let is say fifteen buttons on it , and we have three of those , actually just menus with sub - menus , with or sub - items , sub - functions .
user interface designer : then i would like to make a proposal . if you make one big touch screen ,
industrial designer : yes .
user interface designer : use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest .
industrial designer : like the ipod idea that we just saw . you just have a f a few selected buttons and a few menus , and with this idea you could actually make several you can also improve later on . that will be great .
project manager : so you think it is will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen .
industrial designer : i wou i would actually go for the
project manager : jirun ?
user interface designer : i agree , but it is very important that they always make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen . and so an elder designer picks up th the of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who is all in the systems functions , you will have to have the possibility to turn off the t_v _ or to switch the channel without using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions .
marketing executive : i had another idea about maybe parental control . , like building in some pin code which allows parents to switch to all channels , but children if children the pin code , they ca not switch to violent channels or
user interface designer : wh is that possible to use or no ?
industrial designer : that is possible , that actually depends on the television ,
marketing executive : th there is just
industrial designer : but i figure that would be
user interface designer : does it have to depend on the television ?
marketing executive : ju just a simple log - in , something like that .
industrial designer : y you s you see the fi thing is when you buy a remote , you set the channels , the channels are different on each te television , they are not set in a preset order , if you lock on a remote , let is say channel fifteen , channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television , so that would be actually the main concern .
project manager : .
user interface designer : that he means that maybe by some option make that remote control and the t_v _ match , and then after that you can use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children can not use this change the settings of the t_v _ , like colour and then volume and
marketing executive : th that , but maybe if you log in first as a parent , you address the channels and like , that is channel fifteen , that is vi violent channel ,
user interface designer : something like that .
marketing executive : m my ki my kids i do not want my kids to watch that , then you set the priority to only parents ,
user interface designer : b but make it a separate option in the menu ,
industrial designer : that would b
marketing executive : but
industrial designer : that .
user interface designer : so that it is dif dis displayed from displayed here ,
marketing executive : but , that is just
user interface designer : parents
marketing executive : that is an a an added feature .
project manager : but let is not go too wide about the those things , that is that why we are here .
marketing executive : th those things are .
project manager : it is it is a idea , but that is we wel later in the stage . i have one little question about a total touch screen or a p
marketing executive : partial .
project manager : a partial , because elderly people may be not used to a touch screen , so they want the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , to be , kinda traditionals and the other functions , the more difficult functions to be maybe on the touch screen , but to keep this as normal as possible , to keep it accessible .
marketing executive : but if you display it on l_c_d _ screen with r really big numbers
user interface designer : you can de display it on the old style .
marketing executive : that is just as e just as easy .
industrial designer : . i do
user interface designer : you can display actual buttons on the touch screens .
project manager : . , that is true .
industrial designer : i do agree , because , it is just not the same when you touch a touch screen
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : or when you touch a button , but we have to look at what is our target audience .
marketing executive : it is different .
industrial designer : w we are aiming for younger people
project manager : that is true , .
industrial designer : and they chose
marketing executive : age b below forty .
project manager : that is a good point .
industrial designer : so that is probably a
marketing executive : and th those young people , . y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy ,
project manager : they like the fancy , .
marketing executive : so a touch screen , like microsoft al already developed something like that for multi - media applications . i th we can do that too .
project manager : . , as you can see the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are done .
marketing executive : done .
project manager : i have added the this four things from the management board just to keep in mind . each time i had a summary on what you told and what you personal think . so that can be read out . a f a few things i noticed were moment . th the main points in this meeting is how it is going to look with we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to have more options and have them hidden , so they do not you do not have a big thing full of buttons or and the point that you wanna use one controller for hypothetically each television , so you must the functions , know , like the menus or the parental control must be all by the done by the remote control and not by the television . that is the point what we discussed .
marketing executive : some of them . the menus are not identical for all th for all t_v_s , so you have to display it on one t_v _ .
user interface designer : you can use when you how do you call it , s synchronized , the remote and the t_v _ ,
marketing executive : but that is not possible .
user interface designer : then there is always , there are always possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume
marketing executive :  , .
user interface designer : and maybe we can look out if there is options that the remote in its memory can see what kinda t_v _ it is , it is a philips , this and that , and then give the options that are capable the capable from the t
project manager : but you have an
marketing executive : add th that is an opportunity .
project manager : but you have an international market range , so you have a big range of
user interface designer : there are universal d remotes and they all have a functionality for all the t_v_s , so this would not be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these .
industrial designer : but they
project manager : and it is not too complex to do it .
industrial designer : they all have to be programmed to fit your t_v _
marketing executive : no .
industrial designer : and that is bit of a tricky job . i actually use one of those when they are they are kinda troublesome , but whe when you start building something like this you have to build a receiver into the t into the remotes , because in order for the remote to process something from the t_v _ , like to synchronise and you have to send and receive ,
user interface designer :  . mo
industrial designer : and that is
marketing executive : no no .
user interface designer : no , you can just say the c
marketing executive : he he me he means just one other thing .
project manager : just build it in .
marketing executive : with the current remote controls , the universal ones , you have to press a code for t_v _ .
user interface designer : in codes , y you get a b a book with codes . you look up , i have a philips h _ fifty five and it says press code four five
industrial designer : ,
user interface designer : and you press code four five on the in the remote and it displays all your menu options .
industrial designer : that would be possible , .
marketing executive : now we just connect the t_v _ type to a set of options , in just in the memory ,
user interface designer : memory in the remote .
industrial designer : profiles .
marketing executive : so that if you , like profile , so that if you touch in like one four one zero t_v _ the memory pops up the options .
industrial designer : . , that would be possible .
marketing executive : i th do not think that is that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables .
industrial designer : no , that would not be , a few variables .
user interface designer : if you look at the manuals from universal remotes , there are maybe three four hundreds t_v_s at maximum . if you have all of them , all the old and new t_v_s summed up , it is possible .
industrial designer : it is . it is definitely po
marketing executive : but , on the other hand , if you have a remote and buy a new t_v _ that is not incorporated in the remote
project manager : we have five minutes to go .
user interface designer : then you have to buy a new one , it is very good for marketing
marketing executive : new remote ?
user interface designer : maybe , or an update , software update .
marketing executive : a firmware upgrade ,
user interface designer : firmware update , you say .
industrial designer : firmware upgrade .
marketing executive : but from where ? maybe w
industrial designer : that is maybe the cup holder .
marketing executive : no m may no , maybe we can incorporate some u_s_b _ or a firewire connection , so that you can connect it to the p_c _ and download the newest firmware from the internet .
industrial designer : not everybody has a p_c _ at home . the most people have ,
user interface designer : at
industrial designer : but not everybody
user interface designer : you can go back to the shop and they
marketing executive : like a s service centre .
user interface designer : ser o
industrial designer : maybe something like service cen
user interface designer : and they can download it for you .
industrial designer : or you could s actually look at the place - holder you talked about earlier , and you could probably make a connection to an telephone line or a internet connection .
user interface designer : already digital information is sent t to the standards , t_v _ connections , you can see what is programme is on the new channels , so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard t_v _
industrial designer : then it is be back to the building a receiving if it is actually worth it to build it in ,
user interface designer : receiving .
industrial designer : we could actually look at into it , but , it would be bringing more costs with it
user interface designer : difficult .
marketing executive : it is most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates at the service centre or at the shop .
user interface designer : s some it is good idea , .
industrial designer : that would be probably best , . like when you buy a t_v _ you just ask i will
marketing executive : it is it is not a lot of work , just one docking station where you put it in , press start , bling , updated .
industrial designer : that would be best , .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : you do not buy a t_v _ every week , new teev so .
user interface designer : let is save this in the meanwhile
industrial designer : no no . exactly , so
user interface designer : m for which one are we going ?
marketing executive : let is vote .
user interface designer : that one or
industrial designer : my vote goes out to the right .
user interface designer : your vote and your
marketing executive : my vote too . and your vote ?
user interface designer : i was doubting about which one to take , but you have convinced me that if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal remote all elderly people will to do .
marketing executive : and also like a clapping li like device that pops open .
user interface designer : opens up is too difficult
industrial designer : flips open .
user interface designer : or
marketing executive : too difficult , maybe it is easier to break it .
project manager : n .
user interface designer : break it , i do not get
marketing executive : th that i
project manager : it is very sensitive .
user interface designer : so .
marketing executive : like my telephone , it is sensitive too .
project manager : it is almost at the end . so we have now a lunch break , finally , after the lunch break it is back to individual work , once again thirty minutes . i will put my minutes i have updated them so s they are updated in the shared folder too .
marketing executive : thirty minutes ?
project manager : thirty minutes , the
marketing executive : how minutes ?
project manager : failure . the specifi specific instructions for the next meeting you will all will receive at the email . i do not think say much about it , so for your email and hopefully you get it done in the thirty minutes , and i w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes .
marketing executive : one question , how late do we have to get back be back here ?
project manager : thirty minutes .
user interface designer : a quarter to one maybe ?
marketing executive : thirty minutes lunch break ?
project manager : thirty minutes lunch break , .
marketing executive : forty five .
project manager : then would it be one o'clock .
marketing executive : .
project manager : or we ask our personal coach . , that was a very good session , we
user interface designer : is it possible to store this on the share documents or what
marketing executive : me too .
project manager : ye
marketing executive : save as .
project manager : because all things are stored in smart board dot x_d_k _
marketing executive : v
project manager : and that is in
marketing executive : but but you can open a from your pr from your laptop .
user interface designer : save it as an image on the res
marketing executive : maybe .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : export . maybe not export function .
marketing executive : export . export h_t_m_l _ .
user interface designer : no , and use an image if possible .
marketing executive : image ?
user interface designer : j _ peg .
industrial designer : g _ , j _ peg .
user interface designer : j _ peg . , it is better
marketing executive : paper size a _ four . in this directory .
industrial designer : n .
user interface designer : it is not connected to the
project manager : you all have the questionnaire again about the after work .
user interface designer : to our p_c_s .
marketing executive : it is connected .
user interface designer : it is connected ?
project manager : deskt .
industrial designer : to room . i will just saved in my documents . in my own messenger .
project manager : project documents , .
user interface designer : it gives the na .
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : the questionnaire , fill in we fill out d after lunch or
project manager : it is simply filling no , it is also filling out i would do it after lunch .
industrial designer : aye , cheers .
project manager : i am hungry , so do it after lunch . you are welcome .
user interface designer : we can leave the p_c _ on , and return to the
project manager : i bring it to my personal room .
user interface designer : bring to i got ta bring it home .
marketing executive : to my exave executive
project manager : my executive big room with the panting .
user interface designer : a big office .
marketing executive : aye .",,"the project manager opened the meeting and introduced the agenda . the marketing expert presented some new findings on user preferences and tendencies with remote controls . the research indicated that younger users want fancier and more ergonomic remotes , and that users want the company logo to be recognised more often in the remote . the study also indicated that users think teletext is outdated and should be phased out . the user interface designer presented some questions that should be considered in making the design . the industrial designer briefed the team on the new requirements and led them in a discussion in which the team discussed their target group and made decisions on the energy source and buttons to use in the design of their remote . each team member will complete a questionnaire and a summary . the team will not work with teletext . the remote will only control televisions . the corporate image must be recognizable in the product . the remotes will have buttons for power , channel selection , volume control , numerals , and a few lesser used functions such as an lcd screen . according to the research , the target age group is ages 16 to 40 . teletext will no longer be used .the remote will focus on television only . the company motto should be recognizable on the remote and on the television itself . the younger users of the internet will have a preference for simpler designs and products that have fewer buttons . making the remote a rounded , ergonomic shape and using flashing lights to help locate it when lost . whether to include teletext as a feature",X,X,,,,X,,,5.0,BART-Cons

project manager : a minute , my laptop is , there it is , so welcome back . at the functional design meeting the plan is that each one of you , so not me but only you will present the things you worked on the last half hour . i will take minutes and will put the minutes that i have at the end of the session in the shared folder . also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that now or afterwards . i had an email from the management board , i if you a al also received it , but there were four points which are very important . first one is they think that teletext becomes outdated and internet will be the main focus . second one is also important , because it is one of the discussion points of the previous session . the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it not gonna it is not gonna be a multi - purpose remote control , so that is one thing to keep in mind . second , and that is important for the marketing expert , the current customers are in the age group of forty years and older , but with this new remote they will would like to reach a group younger than forty . and to keep in mind , but not really for now is that they want the slogan and the logo to be recognised more in the remote . so , we have forty minutes , so not more than ten minutes per presentation each , and use all the facilities so that you have either smartboards , the word files , what you whatever you want . tim , can you start ?
marketing executive : welcome . i have some new findings on marketing expert level ,
user interface designer :  .
marketing executive : which i will show you . the method i used was giving orders to our usability lab to do a questionnaire . one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing department generated a report with a lot of results . , these were a couple of findings , first page of three . , we have three audiences of two audiences , i am . the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age . the second one is from sixty four forty six to sixty five . , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent sixty five . second audience is thirty five percent . and some interests from the age groups , it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy new technology , like an l_c_d _ screen on the remote control , speech recognition . i do not think that is really appropriate . , and when you see the audience , the age is going up , they do not really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . second findings out of the questionnaire are the opinion the opinions of the audience about current remote controls . first point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . so that is maybe something for the user interface designer . third findings . according to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , following buttons are most important . , i will tell something about the way this test was , done . , persons were asked what the buttons were they use most , how much an hour ,
project manager :  .
marketing executive : and in the second table the importance of those buttons . , when you multiply them , you get the these three points . switching channels , that is pretty normal , that is what you do with a remote control . the second , teletext , and the third , volume controls . , it is good that we the user want wants , at least the these three points have to be very clear .
project manager : but it is strange that the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be outdated by the internet . so that is strange .
marketing executive : . , but at the moment teletext is , th the best thing you can get on t_v _ , like getting information .
project manager : .
marketing executive : so , when you ask people , what do they use , they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control . that is ridiculous . that is a ne i it it is a new technology , but it is not incorporated right now . my personal preferences . , we should aim at the audience from sixteen to forty five . , first of all it is the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . second , you will get the most revenue from i from it . people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of t_v _ , more than people who are el elder . second point , we have to impro improve the most used functions , as i said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . third point that came out of the questionnaire , people used to get lost off the remote controller , so maybe it is an idea for us to design ex placeholder on side of the , of the t_v _
project manager : that is a idea .
marketing executive : where you can put the remote control in . , that is about it , .
industrial designer : when you mentioned improving functions , what do you mean by that what are you think about ?
marketing executive : not the r not the functions ,
industrial designer : the funtionability .
marketing executive : but it came out that a lot of buttons were not even used on a remote control . so you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds of buttons , but if you do not use them , it is
industrial designer : so focusing more on the used buttons .
marketing executive : they have to be on it j just to t to get it done if necessary , but the most used buttons have to be bigger or
industrial designer : could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function .
marketing executive : perhaps . just for the minor functions perhaps .
industrial designer : ma perhaps , just an idea .
marketing executive : just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn .
project manager : tim . janus , can you
industrial designer : i will go , . right , i will be explaining a bit about working design about the project . what i did was i dissected current remote controls and i viewed how they w looked , how they worked , what components are involved , and how they are connected together . and after that i put up a scheme about how these things are organised and i will show it to you in a few seconds . and i will explain a bit about how it works and how we could build one and why several possibilities that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . what i did was i checked remote controls and the remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . and the thing about that is the remote controls have to act as a t_v _ or a stereo , and those have a transmitter that is also focused on infrared , so if we want to build a remote control with bluetooth then the t_v _ should have bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus that is that would not mean a cheap remote control for us . so that is probably why most controls are still infrared . furthermore they all have a very simple structure , so that would probably mean lower costs and i that could mean for us a good thing we should be able to build a relatively cheap a cheap remote . as i mentioned ready , we have some bluetooth it may be possible , but i figured it would not be possible in within our budget , but that is not for me to decide , but that is maybe something for marketing to look into . f because my personal opinion is not to do bluetooth or radio waves , although
marketing executive : what do you think about incorporating bluetooth or a radio receiver in the place - holder next to the t_v _ , connected to the t_v _ ?
industrial designer : actually i have t
marketing executive : so it is in the wrong product .
industrial designer : . , i actually i figured that would be rather , but then you would still have the infrared function . so in theory you would actually just move the problem , but what i did think about was when you mentioned about the cup - holder , is why not introduce a speech function like where is the remote . if somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes beep , maybe something to look into , what the cost that something like that would be . but it may be something to explore . i will just explain a bit of the components . first you have the energy source . the energy source would be a battery , simple battery that you can find anywhere . i figured that would be best , when the battery stops functioning we could just use you could just go out and buy a new one . so we did not and we do not have to do all to be too complicated about that . the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but the infrared button works only via the chip and the subcomponent to the switch there is a switch between these . when the switch is pressed in a w on this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , a electric current goes through here , and in immediately , a l a bulb lights up displaying to the user that something has happened . that is that is so the h user wo not be thinking , did the button be pressed , w what happened . or i press button but nothing is happening on the t_v _ , so is something wrong . so that is just to explain the of to make it clearer to the user . w the signal goes via chip that is translated into electric sig electronic signals and then it is processed and then it is sent to the infrared bulb where it will be received on the receiving end . and those interpreted by the device , in this case the television . my personal preferences here , we have to keep it simple . not too many gadgets and functions , just like you said the most users n you have a lot of buttons and you u use you do not use them , so why should we invent w spend more time on those . we should stick by with infrared transmitting and no receiving . so no input from the television . we should not be spending time on teletext and st things like that , because when you want teletext on infrared you would have to build in a receiver too , and so in order to receive the signals from what is on t_v _ and such . i figure that would be spending too much money and time
marketing executive : maybe another problem , current t_v_s can even send infrared .
industrial designer : yes , but what should we s i f i agree with you , but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the remote control ? that would be extra components , extra designs , larger g remote control .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : these all that we have to take in account . so i my personal opinion is no receiver . we should look into the design and the functionability . like i said , use one button for m multiple functions , or just hide the few buttons o of switching it open , the usual . and do not overbuild , we should not make a big remote control for simple functions , but we should stick to the basics . so that was my personal opinion . and that was my presentation
project manager : janus .
user interface designer : yes ,
project manager : you do ?
user interface designer : go ahead .
project manager : the last presentation . you have plenty of time ,
user interface designer : last presentation .
project manager : tim and janus do not talk to ten minutes , so take your time . if you take your time too long i will eventually warn you .
user interface designer : i am going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and usability functions . what is my opinion about what is most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , so if you going to design a remote that looks good , that should not weigh over the if it is possible to make , but also the user friendliness , so tha that is some of the main points . and another one is the use of many functions will make it more difficult , so use as little functions as possible or at least do not display them all at once on the same remote . if you have fifty functions you do not want fifty buttons t to be shown at the same time , when you visit an internet site you do not want fifty links to see , but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy structure . and one of the ideas was maybe use touch screen , but s i in how far that is possible , since we are sticking to infrared and the remote can not receive anything , but we might consider that . i hope this is all clear to you . if you can use remote like this with all the functions , many functions , but , your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this . you have to be very careful what you push , and if you are looking for teletext you will be searching for half an hour from where is it ? where the hell he here i and , when you have to use something else . so just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use . if you want to use a play and back and stop , that is very important . this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but it is no longer applying . i prefer to use it only for t_v _ and n not to give too many options and if possible , the buttons should give a dr direct action , not first select
project manager : you just said you wanted to combine more functions in one , you want to keep it simple ,
user interface designer : and so that is where the difficulties lie .
industrial designer : but
project manager : but that if you want to do that , then you ca not escape the fact that there will be buttons which give s more options than one .
user interface designer : this so that is the thing you have to weigh against each other . do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or multi - purpose as we thought , or do we want to use many buttons . so weighing those factors .
marketing executive : it is maybe an option if you use an l_c_d _ or a touch screen , that in the middle are the main keys , like displayed on the
user interface designer : the does not .
marketing executive : this ? something like that . just in the middle the general functions , like play , channel switching , and then at the top or at the bottom , some menus like settings or that you can drop down .
user interface designer : but when all the questions i had do we want to use a menu display on the t_v _ ? or does have to f everything be in remotes ? if you use a memory display on the t_v _ , you can simply push a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press . so that is my recommendation , if you use many options in one buttle button , display the menu on the t_v _
marketing executive : nah .
user interface designer : and do not use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , is too complicated for most users .
marketing executive : so too , but and that is partly because a lot of t_v_s have different menus , and when you have a particular menu at your device , it could be that do not correspond to the menu what is actually on t_v _ .
user interface designer : that will be a problem .
industrial designer : you d you have to keep in mind that several t_v_s do not even have a menu structure , or they have a very simple menu structure , so you have to keep in mind that not all d not our remote wo not be able to work on all televisions .
user interface designer : yes .
industrial designer : and that would be a considerable problem .
user interface designer : if we have to stick with current technologies and , the restrictions of what is is on the market today , you should keep it s at this . use big clear buttons . so maybe we will loose a few option options , but i this is more important . especially the important buttons , if you want to switch channel , change your volume , use teletext , it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind a little thing or a touch screen .
industrial designer : not embed but then with something like a touch screen could make more menu up pop up .
user interface designer : and , if you want to s put on stand - by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do . not first change menu options or switch something . , as you already told , give some feedback . if the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low . and , my conclusion is less is more , keep it simple . maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to keep it accessible on t because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the television , some you will never know and never use , and therefore it is important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions that are not so important you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they are not in the way for the most important functions .
marketing executive : . , the idea about touch screen is very good . , because recently i saw news item on t_v _ about new telephones for elder people . , they have like a touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hang - up , and that is a big ad advantage , because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures . it is very visual intended . what was i to say more ?
user interface designer : maybe that is an option . keep the primary buttons visible . make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues , put a logo on it and maybe use it in some aesthetic form . but th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen , or if that is will become too difficult just like televi some o older telephones use a l maybe it is possible to flip them open and just expand the number of options that are normally visible .
marketing executive : but if you pick the idea , the left idea then what is gonna be displayed on the touch screen ?
industrial designer : the extra functions .
user interface designer : the extra functions , you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one ,
marketing executive : but l like menu functions or
user interface designer : and then all the options will become available and you just c s t scroll through them .
industrial designer : would not it be better to make just one big touch screen , one small touch screen applet
marketing executive : so .
industrial designer : and i will just make let is say fifteen buttons on it , and we have three of those , actually just menus with sub - menus , with or sub - items , sub - functions .
user interface designer : then i would like to make a proposal . if you make one big touch screen ,
industrial designer : yes .
user interface designer : use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest .
industrial designer : like the ipod idea that we just saw . you just have a f a few selected buttons and a few menus , and with this idea you could actually make several you can also improve later on . that will be great .
project manager : so you think it is will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen .
industrial designer : i wou i would actually go for the
project manager : jirun ?
user interface designer : i agree , but it is very important that they always make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen . and so an elder designer picks up th the of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who is all in the systems functions , you will have to have the possibility to turn off the t_v _ or to switch the channel without using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions .
marketing executive : i had another idea about maybe parental control . , like building in some pin code which allows parents to switch to all channels , but children if children the pin code , they ca not switch to violent channels or
user interface designer : wh is that possible to use or no ?
industrial designer : that is possible , that actually depends on the television ,
marketing executive : th there is just
industrial designer : but i figure that would be
user interface designer : does it have to depend on the television ?
marketing executive : ju just a simple log - in , something like that .
industrial designer : y you s you see the fi thing is when you buy a remote , you set the channels , the channels are different on each te television , they are not set in a preset order , if you lock on a remote , let is say channel fifteen , channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television , so that would be actually the main concern .
project manager : .
user interface designer : that he means that maybe by some option make that remote control and the t_v _ match , and then after that you can use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children can not use this change the settings of the t_v _ , like colour and then volume and
marketing executive : th that , but maybe if you log in first as a parent , you address the channels and like , that is channel fifteen , that is vi violent channel ,
user interface designer : something like that .
marketing executive : m my ki my kids i do not want my kids to watch that , then you set the priority to only parents ,
user interface designer : b but make it a separate option in the menu ,
industrial designer : that would b
marketing executive : but
industrial designer : that .
user interface designer : so that it is dif dis displayed from displayed here ,
marketing executive : but , that is just
user interface designer : parents
marketing executive : that is an a an added feature .
project manager : but let is not go too wide about the those things , that is that why we are here .
marketing executive : th those things are .
project manager : it is it is a idea , but that is we wel later in the stage . i have one little question about a total touch screen or a p
marketing executive : partial .
project manager : a partial , because elderly people may be not used to a touch screen , so they want the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , to be , kinda traditionals and the other functions , the more difficult functions to be maybe on the touch screen , but to keep this as normal as possible , to keep it accessible .
marketing executive : but if you display it on l_c_d _ screen with r really big numbers
user interface designer : you can de display it on the old style .
marketing executive : that is just as e just as easy .
industrial designer : . i do
user interface designer : you can display actual buttons on the touch screens .
project manager : . , that is true .
industrial designer : i do agree , because , it is just not the same when you touch a touch screen
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : or when you touch a button , but we have to look at what is our target audience .
marketing executive : it is different .
industrial designer : w we are aiming for younger people
project manager : that is true , .
industrial designer : and they chose
marketing executive : age b below forty .
project manager : that is a good point .
industrial designer : so that is probably a
marketing executive : and th those young people , . y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy ,
project manager : they like the fancy , .
marketing executive : so a touch screen , like microsoft al already developed something like that for multi - media applications . i th we can do that too .
project manager : . , as you can see the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are done .
marketing executive : done .
project manager : i have added the this four things from the management board just to keep in mind . each time i had a summary on what you told and what you personal think . so that can be read out . a f a few things i noticed were moment . th the main points in this meeting is how it is going to look with we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to have more options and have them hidden , so they do not you do not have a big thing full of buttons or and the point that you wanna use one controller for hypothetically each television , so you must the functions , know , like the menus or the parental control must be all by the done by the remote control and not by the television . that is the point what we discussed .
marketing executive : some of them . the menus are not identical for all th for all t_v_s , so you have to display it on one t_v _ .
user interface designer : you can use when you how do you call it , s synchronized , the remote and the t_v _ ,
marketing executive : but that is not possible .
user interface designer : then there is always , there are always possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume
marketing executive :  , .
user interface designer : and maybe we can look out if there is options that the remote in its memory can see what kinda t_v _ it is , it is a philips , this and that , and then give the options that are capable the capable from the t
project manager : but you have an
marketing executive : add th that is an opportunity .
project manager : but you have an international market range , so you have a big range of
user interface designer : there are universal d remotes and they all have a functionality for all the t_v_s , so this would not be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these .
industrial designer : but they
project manager : and it is not too complex to do it .
industrial designer : they all have to be programmed to fit your t_v _
marketing executive : no .
industrial designer : and that is bit of a tricky job . i actually use one of those when they are they are kinda troublesome , but whe when you start building something like this you have to build a receiver into the t into the remotes , because in order for the remote to process something from the t_v _ , like to synchronise and you have to send and receive ,
user interface designer :  . mo
industrial designer : and that is
marketing executive : no no .
user interface designer : no , you can just say the c
marketing executive : he he me he means just one other thing .
project manager : just build it in .
marketing executive : with the current remote controls , the universal ones , you have to press a code for t_v _ .
user interface designer : in codes , y you get a b a book with codes . you look up , i have a philips h _ fifty five and it says press code four five
industrial designer : ,
user interface designer : and you press code four five on the in the remote and it displays all your menu options .
industrial designer : that would be possible , .
marketing executive : now we just connect the t_v _ type to a set of options , in just in the memory ,
user interface designer : memory in the remote .
industrial designer : profiles .
marketing executive : so that if you , like profile , so that if you touch in like one four one zero t_v _ the memory pops up the options .
industrial designer : . , that would be possible .
marketing executive : i th do not think that is that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables .
industrial designer : no , that would not be , a few variables .
user interface designer : if you look at the manuals from universal remotes , there are maybe three four hundreds t_v_s at maximum . if you have all of them , all the old and new t_v_s summed up , it is possible .
industrial designer : it is . it is definitely po
marketing executive : but , on the other hand , if you have a remote and buy a new t_v _ that is not incorporated in the remote
project manager : we have five minutes to go .
user interface designer : then you have to buy a new one , it is very good for marketing
marketing executive : new remote ?
user interface designer : maybe , or an update , software update .
marketing executive : a firmware upgrade ,
user interface designer : firmware update , you say .
industrial designer : firmware upgrade .
marketing executive : but from where ? maybe w
industrial designer : that is maybe the cup holder .
marketing executive : no m may no , maybe we can incorporate some u_s_b _ or a firewire connection , so that you can connect it to the p_c _ and download the newest firmware from the internet .
industrial designer : not everybody has a p_c _ at home . the most people have ,
user interface designer : at
industrial designer : but not everybody
user interface designer : you can go back to the shop and they
marketing executive : like a s service centre .
user interface designer : ser o
industrial designer : maybe something like service cen
user interface designer : and they can download it for you .
industrial designer : or you could s actually look at the place - holder you talked about earlier , and you could probably make a connection to an telephone line or a internet connection .
user interface designer : already digital information is sent t to the standards , t_v _ connections , you can see what is programme is on the new channels , so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard t_v _
industrial designer : then it is be back to the building a receiving if it is actually worth it to build it in ,
user interface designer : receiving .
industrial designer : we could actually look at into it , but , it would be bringing more costs with it
user interface designer : difficult .
marketing executive : it is most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates at the service centre or at the shop .
user interface designer : s some it is good idea , .
industrial designer : that would be probably best , . like when you buy a t_v _ you just ask i will
marketing executive : it is it is not a lot of work , just one docking station where you put it in , press start , bling , updated .
industrial designer : that would be best , .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : you do not buy a t_v _ every week , new teev so .
user interface designer : let is save this in the meanwhile
industrial designer : no no . exactly , so
user interface designer : m for which one are we going ?
marketing executive : let is vote .
user interface designer : that one or
industrial designer : my vote goes out to the right .
user interface designer : your vote and your
marketing executive : my vote too . and your vote ?
user interface designer : i was doubting about which one to take , but you have convinced me that if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal remote all elderly people will to do .
marketing executive : and also like a clapping li like device that pops open .
user interface designer : opens up is too difficult
industrial designer : flips open .
user interface designer : or
marketing executive : too difficult , maybe it is easier to break it .
project manager : n .
user interface designer : break it , i do not get
marketing executive : th that i
project manager : it is very sensitive .
user interface designer : so .
marketing executive : like my telephone , it is sensitive too .
project manager : it is almost at the end . so we have now a lunch break , finally , after the lunch break it is back to individual work , once again thirty minutes . i will put my minutes i have updated them so s they are updated in the shared folder too .
marketing executive : thirty minutes ?
project manager : thirty minutes , the
marketing executive : how minutes ?
project manager : failure . the specifi specific instructions for the next meeting you will all will receive at the email . i do not think say much about it , so for your email and hopefully you get it done in the thirty minutes , and i w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes .
marketing executive : one question , how late do we have to get back be back here ?
project manager : thirty minutes .
user interface designer : a quarter to one maybe ?
marketing executive : thirty minutes lunch break ?
project manager : thirty minutes lunch break , .
marketing executive : forty five .
project manager : then would it be one o'clock .
marketing executive : .
project manager : or we ask our personal coach . , that was a very good session , we
user interface designer : is it possible to store this on the share documents or what
marketing executive : me too .
project manager : ye
marketing executive : save as .
project manager : because all things are stored in smart board dot x_d_k _
marketing executive : v
project manager : and that is in
marketing executive : but but you can open a from your pr from your laptop .
user interface designer : save it as an image on the res
marketing executive : maybe .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : export . maybe not export function .
marketing executive : export . export h_t_m_l _ .
user interface designer : no , and use an image if possible .
marketing executive : image ?
user interface designer : j _ peg .
industrial designer : g _ , j _ peg .
user interface designer : j _ peg . , it is better
marketing executive : paper size a _ four . in this directory .
industrial designer : n .
user interface designer : it is not connected to the
project manager : you all have the questionnaire again about the after work .
user interface designer : to our p_c_s .
marketing executive : it is connected .
user interface designer : it is connected ?
project manager : deskt .
industrial designer : to room . i will just saved in my documents . in my own messenger .
project manager : project documents , .
user interface designer : it gives the na .
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : the questionnaire , fill in we fill out d after lunch or
project manager : it is simply filling no , it is also filling out i would do it after lunch .
industrial designer : aye , cheers .
project manager : i am hungry , so do it after lunch . you are welcome .
user interface designer : we can leave the p_c _ on , and return to the
project manager : i bring it to my personal room .
user interface designer : bring to i got ta bring it home .
marketing executive : to my exave executive
project manager : my executive big room with the panting .
user interface designer : a big office .
marketing executive : aye .",,"the marketing expert presented the results of a usability study done by the marketing department . the study showed that users want a remote that only controls television , and that users would rather have an lcd screen , speech recognition , or a fancy looking remote . according to the study , users want buttons that are easy to use , such as switching channels , teletext , volume controls , as well as a large number of other functions . he also suggested that the remote should not include programmable functions such as programming , which were discussed in the group's work on the technical functions of the remote , including a scroll wheel for the , with a bunna spongy appearance , but not necessary to include a locator function in the design . they also discussed the possibility of using a tv rather than a stylusbutton for the television instead of the current one for the other functions and . after the group discussed the project manager's report , the group decided to use the remote only for televisions .",X,,,,,X,,X,3.0,T5-Baseline

project manager : a minute , my laptop is , there it is , so welcome back . at the functional design meeting the plan is that each one of you , so not me but only you will present the things you worked on the last half hour . i will take minutes and will put the minutes that i have at the end of the session in the shared folder . also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that now or afterwards . i had an email from the management board , i if you a al also received it , but there were four points which are very important . first one is they think that teletext becomes outdated and internet will be the main focus . second one is also important , because it is one of the discussion points of the previous session . the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it not gonna it is not gonna be a multi - purpose remote control , so that is one thing to keep in mind . second , and that is important for the marketing expert , the current customers are in the age group of forty years and older , but with this new remote they will would like to reach a group younger than forty . and to keep in mind , but not really for now is that they want the slogan and the logo to be recognised more in the remote . so , we have forty minutes , so not more than ten minutes per presentation each , and use all the facilities so that you have either smartboards , the word files , what you whatever you want . tim , can you start ?
marketing executive : welcome . i have some new findings on marketing expert level ,
user interface designer :  .
marketing executive : which i will show you . the method i used was giving orders to our usability lab to do a questionnaire . one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing department generated a report with a lot of results . , these were a couple of findings , first page of three . , we have three audiences of two audiences , i am . the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age . the second one is from sixty four forty six to sixty five . , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent sixty five . second audience is thirty five percent . and some interests from the age groups , it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy new technology , like an l_c_d _ screen on the remote control , speech recognition . i do not think that is really appropriate . , and when you see the audience , the age is going up , they do not really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . second findings out of the questionnaire are the opinion the opinions of the audience about current remote controls . first point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . so that is maybe something for the user interface designer . third findings . according to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , following buttons are most important . , i will tell something about the way this test was , done . , persons were asked what the buttons were they use most , how much an hour ,
project manager :  .
marketing executive : and in the second table the importance of those buttons . , when you multiply them , you get the these three points . switching channels , that is pretty normal , that is what you do with a remote control . the second , teletext , and the third , volume controls . , it is good that we the user want wants , at least the these three points have to be very clear .
project manager : but it is strange that the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be outdated by the internet . so that is strange .
marketing executive : . , but at the moment teletext is , th the best thing you can get on t_v _ , like getting information .
project manager : .
marketing executive : so , when you ask people , what do they use , they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control . that is ridiculous . that is a ne i it it is a new technology , but it is not incorporated right now . my personal preferences . , we should aim at the audience from sixteen to forty five . , first of all it is the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . second , you will get the most revenue from i from it . people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of t_v _ , more than people who are el elder . second point , we have to impro improve the most used functions , as i said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . third point that came out of the questionnaire , people used to get lost off the remote controller , so maybe it is an idea for us to design ex placeholder on side of the , of the t_v _
project manager : that is a idea .
marketing executive : where you can put the remote control in . , that is about it , .
industrial designer : when you mentioned improving functions , what do you mean by that what are you think about ?
marketing executive : not the r not the functions ,
industrial designer : the funtionability .
marketing executive : but it came out that a lot of buttons were not even used on a remote control . so you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds of buttons , but if you do not use them , it is
industrial designer : so focusing more on the used buttons .
marketing executive : they have to be on it j just to t to get it done if necessary , but the most used buttons have to be bigger or
industrial designer : could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function .
marketing executive : perhaps . just for the minor functions perhaps .
industrial designer : ma perhaps , just an idea .
marketing executive : just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn .
project manager : tim . janus , can you
industrial designer : i will go , . right , i will be explaining a bit about working design about the project . what i did was i dissected current remote controls and i viewed how they w looked , how they worked , what components are involved , and how they are connected together . and after that i put up a scheme about how these things are organised and i will show it to you in a few seconds . and i will explain a bit about how it works and how we could build one and why several possibilities that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . what i did was i checked remote controls and the remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . and the thing about that is the remote controls have to act as a t_v _ or a stereo , and those have a transmitter that is also focused on infrared , so if we want to build a remote control with bluetooth then the t_v _ should have bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus that is that would not mean a cheap remote control for us . so that is probably why most controls are still infrared . furthermore they all have a very simple structure , so that would probably mean lower costs and i that could mean for us a good thing we should be able to build a relatively cheap a cheap remote . as i mentioned ready , we have some bluetooth it may be possible , but i figured it would not be possible in within our budget , but that is not for me to decide , but that is maybe something for marketing to look into . f because my personal opinion is not to do bluetooth or radio waves , although
marketing executive : what do you think about incorporating bluetooth or a radio receiver in the place - holder next to the t_v _ , connected to the t_v _ ?
industrial designer : actually i have t
marketing executive : so it is in the wrong product .
industrial designer : . , i actually i figured that would be rather , but then you would still have the infrared function . so in theory you would actually just move the problem , but what i did think about was when you mentioned about the cup - holder , is why not introduce a speech function like where is the remote . if somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes beep , maybe something to look into , what the cost that something like that would be . but it may be something to explore . i will just explain a bit of the components . first you have the energy source . the energy source would be a battery , simple battery that you can find anywhere . i figured that would be best , when the battery stops functioning we could just use you could just go out and buy a new one . so we did not and we do not have to do all to be too complicated about that . the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but the infrared button works only via the chip and the subcomponent to the switch there is a switch between these . when the switch is pressed in a w on this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , a electric current goes through here , and in immediately , a l a bulb lights up displaying to the user that something has happened . that is that is so the h user wo not be thinking , did the button be pressed , w what happened . or i press button but nothing is happening on the t_v _ , so is something wrong . so that is just to explain the of to make it clearer to the user . w the signal goes via chip that is translated into electric sig electronic signals and then it is processed and then it is sent to the infrared bulb where it will be received on the receiving end . and those interpreted by the device , in this case the television . my personal preferences here , we have to keep it simple . not too many gadgets and functions , just like you said the most users n you have a lot of buttons and you u use you do not use them , so why should we invent w spend more time on those . we should stick by with infrared transmitting and no receiving . so no input from the television . we should not be spending time on teletext and st things like that , because when you want teletext on infrared you would have to build in a receiver too , and so in order to receive the signals from what is on t_v _ and such . i figure that would be spending too much money and time
marketing executive : maybe another problem , current t_v_s can even send infrared .
industrial designer : yes , but what should we s i f i agree with you , but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the remote control ? that would be extra components , extra designs , larger g remote control .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : these all that we have to take in account . so i my personal opinion is no receiver . we should look into the design and the functionability . like i said , use one button for m multiple functions , or just hide the few buttons o of switching it open , the usual . and do not overbuild , we should not make a big remote control for simple functions , but we should stick to the basics . so that was my personal opinion . and that was my presentation
project manager : janus .
user interface designer : yes ,
project manager : you do ?
user interface designer : go ahead .
project manager : the last presentation . you have plenty of time ,
user interface designer : last presentation .
project manager : tim and janus do not talk to ten minutes , so take your time . if you take your time too long i will eventually warn you .
user interface designer : i am going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and usability functions . what is my opinion about what is most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , so if you going to design a remote that looks good , that should not weigh over the if it is possible to make , but also the user friendliness , so tha that is some of the main points . and another one is the use of many functions will make it more difficult , so use as little functions as possible or at least do not display them all at once on the same remote . if you have fifty functions you do not want fifty buttons t to be shown at the same time , when you visit an internet site you do not want fifty links to see , but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy structure . and one of the ideas was maybe use touch screen , but s i in how far that is possible , since we are sticking to infrared and the remote can not receive anything , but we might consider that . i hope this is all clear to you . if you can use remote like this with all the functions , many functions , but , your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this . you have to be very careful what you push , and if you are looking for teletext you will be searching for half an hour from where is it ? where the hell he here i and , when you have to use something else . so just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use . if you want to use a play and back and stop , that is very important . this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but it is no longer applying . i prefer to use it only for t_v _ and n not to give too many options and if possible , the buttons should give a dr direct action , not first select
project manager : you just said you wanted to combine more functions in one , you want to keep it simple ,
user interface designer : and so that is where the difficulties lie .
industrial designer : but
project manager : but that if you want to do that , then you ca not escape the fact that there will be buttons which give s more options than one .
user interface designer : this so that is the thing you have to weigh against each other . do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or multi - purpose as we thought , or do we want to use many buttons . so weighing those factors .
marketing executive : it is maybe an option if you use an l_c_d _ or a touch screen , that in the middle are the main keys , like displayed on the
user interface designer : the does not .
marketing executive : this ? something like that . just in the middle the general functions , like play , channel switching , and then at the top or at the bottom , some menus like settings or that you can drop down .
user interface designer : but when all the questions i had do we want to use a menu display on the t_v _ ? or does have to f everything be in remotes ? if you use a memory display on the t_v _ , you can simply push a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press . so that is my recommendation , if you use many options in one buttle button , display the menu on the t_v _
marketing executive : nah .
user interface designer : and do not use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , is too complicated for most users .
marketing executive : so too , but and that is partly because a lot of t_v_s have different menus , and when you have a particular menu at your device , it could be that do not correspond to the menu what is actually on t_v _ .
user interface designer : that will be a problem .
industrial designer : you d you have to keep in mind that several t_v_s do not even have a menu structure , or they have a very simple menu structure , so you have to keep in mind that not all d not our remote wo not be able to work on all televisions .
user interface designer : yes .
industrial designer : and that would be a considerable problem .
user interface designer : if we have to stick with current technologies and , the restrictions of what is is on the market today , you should keep it s at this . use big clear buttons . so maybe we will loose a few option options , but i this is more important . especially the important buttons , if you want to switch channel , change your volume , use teletext , it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind a little thing or a touch screen .
industrial designer : not embed but then with something like a touch screen could make more menu up pop up .
user interface designer : and , if you want to s put on stand - by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do . not first change menu options or switch something . , as you already told , give some feedback . if the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low . and , my conclusion is less is more , keep it simple . maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to keep it accessible on t because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the television , some you will never know and never use , and therefore it is important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions that are not so important you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they are not in the way for the most important functions .
marketing executive : . , the idea about touch screen is very good . , because recently i saw news item on t_v _ about new telephones for elder people . , they have like a touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hang - up , and that is a big ad advantage , because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures . it is very visual intended . what was i to say more ?
user interface designer : maybe that is an option . keep the primary buttons visible . make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues , put a logo on it and maybe use it in some aesthetic form . but th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen , or if that is will become too difficult just like televi some o older telephones use a l maybe it is possible to flip them open and just expand the number of options that are normally visible .
marketing executive : but if you pick the idea , the left idea then what is gonna be displayed on the touch screen ?
industrial designer : the extra functions .
user interface designer : the extra functions , you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one ,
marketing executive : but l like menu functions or
user interface designer : and then all the options will become available and you just c s t scroll through them .
industrial designer : would not it be better to make just one big touch screen , one small touch screen applet
marketing executive : so .
industrial designer : and i will just make let is say fifteen buttons on it , and we have three of those , actually just menus with sub - menus , with or sub - items , sub - functions .
user interface designer : then i would like to make a proposal . if you make one big touch screen ,
industrial designer : yes .
user interface designer : use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest .
industrial designer : like the ipod idea that we just saw . you just have a f a few selected buttons and a few menus , and with this idea you could actually make several you can also improve later on . that will be great .
project manager : so you think it is will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen .
industrial designer : i wou i would actually go for the
project manager : jirun ?
user interface designer : i agree , but it is very important that they always make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen . and so an elder designer picks up th the of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who is all in the systems functions , you will have to have the possibility to turn off the t_v _ or to switch the channel without using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions .
marketing executive : i had another idea about maybe parental control . , like building in some pin code which allows parents to switch to all channels , but children if children the pin code , they ca not switch to violent channels or
user interface designer : wh is that possible to use or no ?
industrial designer : that is possible , that actually depends on the television ,
marketing executive : th there is just
industrial designer : but i figure that would be
user interface designer : does it have to depend on the television ?
marketing executive : ju just a simple log - in , something like that .
industrial designer : y you s you see the fi thing is when you buy a remote , you set the channels , the channels are different on each te television , they are not set in a preset order , if you lock on a remote , let is say channel fifteen , channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television , so that would be actually the main concern .
project manager : .
user interface designer : that he means that maybe by some option make that remote control and the t_v _ match , and then after that you can use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children can not use this change the settings of the t_v _ , like colour and then volume and
marketing executive : th that , but maybe if you log in first as a parent , you address the channels and like , that is channel fifteen , that is vi violent channel ,
user interface designer : something like that .
marketing executive : m my ki my kids i do not want my kids to watch that , then you set the priority to only parents ,
user interface designer : b but make it a separate option in the menu ,
industrial designer : that would b
marketing executive : but
industrial designer : that .
user interface designer : so that it is dif dis displayed from displayed here ,
marketing executive : but , that is just
user interface designer : parents
marketing executive : that is an a an added feature .
project manager : but let is not go too wide about the those things , that is that why we are here .
marketing executive : th those things are .
project manager : it is it is a idea , but that is we wel later in the stage . i have one little question about a total touch screen or a p
marketing executive : partial .
project manager : a partial , because elderly people may be not used to a touch screen , so they want the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , to be , kinda traditionals and the other functions , the more difficult functions to be maybe on the touch screen , but to keep this as normal as possible , to keep it accessible .
marketing executive : but if you display it on l_c_d _ screen with r really big numbers
user interface designer : you can de display it on the old style .
marketing executive : that is just as e just as easy .
industrial designer : . i do
user interface designer : you can display actual buttons on the touch screens .
project manager : . , that is true .
industrial designer : i do agree , because , it is just not the same when you touch a touch screen
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : or when you touch a button , but we have to look at what is our target audience .
marketing executive : it is different .
industrial designer : w we are aiming for younger people
project manager : that is true , .
industrial designer : and they chose
marketing executive : age b below forty .
project manager : that is a good point .
industrial designer : so that is probably a
marketing executive : and th those young people , . y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy ,
project manager : they like the fancy , .
marketing executive : so a touch screen , like microsoft al already developed something like that for multi - media applications . i th we can do that too .
project manager : . , as you can see the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are done .
marketing executive : done .
project manager : i have added the this four things from the management board just to keep in mind . each time i had a summary on what you told and what you personal think . so that can be read out . a f a few things i noticed were moment . th the main points in this meeting is how it is going to look with we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to have more options and have them hidden , so they do not you do not have a big thing full of buttons or and the point that you wanna use one controller for hypothetically each television , so you must the functions , know , like the menus or the parental control must be all by the done by the remote control and not by the television . that is the point what we discussed .
marketing executive : some of them . the menus are not identical for all th for all t_v_s , so you have to display it on one t_v _ .
user interface designer : you can use when you how do you call it , s synchronized , the remote and the t_v _ ,
marketing executive : but that is not possible .
user interface designer : then there is always , there are always possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume
marketing executive :  , .
user interface designer : and maybe we can look out if there is options that the remote in its memory can see what kinda t_v _ it is , it is a philips , this and that , and then give the options that are capable the capable from the t
project manager : but you have an
marketing executive : add th that is an opportunity .
project manager : but you have an international market range , so you have a big range of
user interface designer : there are universal d remotes and they all have a functionality for all the t_v_s , so this would not be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these .
industrial designer : but they
project manager : and it is not too complex to do it .
industrial designer : they all have to be programmed to fit your t_v _
marketing executive : no .
industrial designer : and that is bit of a tricky job . i actually use one of those when they are they are kinda troublesome , but whe when you start building something like this you have to build a receiver into the t into the remotes , because in order for the remote to process something from the t_v _ , like to synchronise and you have to send and receive ,
user interface designer :  . mo
industrial designer : and that is
marketing executive : no no .
user interface designer : no , you can just say the c
marketing executive : he he me he means just one other thing .
project manager : just build it in .
marketing executive : with the current remote controls , the universal ones , you have to press a code for t_v _ .
user interface designer : in codes , y you get a b a book with codes . you look up , i have a philips h _ fifty five and it says press code four five
industrial designer : ,
user interface designer : and you press code four five on the in the remote and it displays all your menu options .
industrial designer : that would be possible , .
marketing executive : now we just connect the t_v _ type to a set of options , in just in the memory ,
user interface designer : memory in the remote .
industrial designer : profiles .
marketing executive : so that if you , like profile , so that if you touch in like one four one zero t_v _ the memory pops up the options .
industrial designer : . , that would be possible .
marketing executive : i th do not think that is that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables .
industrial designer : no , that would not be , a few variables .
user interface designer : if you look at the manuals from universal remotes , there are maybe three four hundreds t_v_s at maximum . if you have all of them , all the old and new t_v_s summed up , it is possible .
industrial designer : it is . it is definitely po
marketing executive : but , on the other hand , if you have a remote and buy a new t_v _ that is not incorporated in the remote
project manager : we have five minutes to go .
user interface designer : then you have to buy a new one , it is very good for marketing
marketing executive : new remote ?
user interface designer : maybe , or an update , software update .
marketing executive : a firmware upgrade ,
user interface designer : firmware update , you say .
industrial designer : firmware upgrade .
marketing executive : but from where ? maybe w
industrial designer : that is maybe the cup holder .
marketing executive : no m may no , maybe we can incorporate some u_s_b _ or a firewire connection , so that you can connect it to the p_c _ and download the newest firmware from the internet .
industrial designer : not everybody has a p_c _ at home . the most people have ,
user interface designer : at
industrial designer : but not everybody
user interface designer : you can go back to the shop and they
marketing executive : like a s service centre .
user interface designer : ser o
industrial designer : maybe something like service cen
user interface designer : and they can download it for you .
industrial designer : or you could s actually look at the place - holder you talked about earlier , and you could probably make a connection to an telephone line or a internet connection .
user interface designer : already digital information is sent t to the standards , t_v _ connections , you can see what is programme is on the new channels , so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard t_v _
industrial designer : then it is be back to the building a receiving if it is actually worth it to build it in ,
user interface designer : receiving .
industrial designer : we could actually look at into it , but , it would be bringing more costs with it
user interface designer : difficult .
marketing executive : it is most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates at the service centre or at the shop .
user interface designer : s some it is good idea , .
industrial designer : that would be probably best , . like when you buy a t_v _ you just ask i will
marketing executive : it is it is not a lot of work , just one docking station where you put it in , press start , bling , updated .
industrial designer : that would be best , .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : you do not buy a t_v _ every week , new teev so .
user interface designer : let is save this in the meanwhile
industrial designer : no no . exactly , so
user interface designer : m for which one are we going ?
marketing executive : let is vote .
user interface designer : that one or
industrial designer : my vote goes out to the right .
user interface designer : your vote and your
marketing executive : my vote too . and your vote ?
user interface designer : i was doubting about which one to take , but you have convinced me that if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal remote all elderly people will to do .
marketing executive : and also like a clapping li like device that pops open .
user interface designer : opens up is too difficult
industrial designer : flips open .
user interface designer : or
marketing executive : too difficult , maybe it is easier to break it .
project manager : n .
user interface designer : break it , i do not get
marketing executive : th that i
project manager : it is very sensitive .
user interface designer : so .
marketing executive : like my telephone , it is sensitive too .
project manager : it is almost at the end . so we have now a lunch break , finally , after the lunch break it is back to individual work , once again thirty minutes . i will put my minutes i have updated them so s they are updated in the shared folder too .
marketing executive : thirty minutes ?
project manager : thirty minutes , the
marketing executive : how minutes ?
project manager : failure . the specifi specific instructions for the next meeting you will all will receive at the email . i do not think say much about it , so for your email and hopefully you get it done in the thirty minutes , and i w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes .
marketing executive : one question , how late do we have to get back be back here ?
project manager : thirty minutes .
user interface designer : a quarter to one maybe ?
marketing executive : thirty minutes lunch break ?
project manager : thirty minutes lunch break , .
marketing executive : forty five .
project manager : then would it be one o'clock .
marketing executive : .
project manager : or we ask our personal coach . , that was a very good session , we
user interface designer : is it possible to store this on the share documents or what
marketing executive : me too .
project manager : ye
marketing executive : save as .
project manager : because all things are stored in smart board dot x_d_k _
marketing executive : v
project manager : and that is in
marketing executive : but but you can open a from your pr from your laptop .
user interface designer : save it as an image on the res
marketing executive : maybe .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : export . maybe not export function .
marketing executive : export . export h_t_m_l _ .
user interface designer : no , and use an image if possible .
marketing executive : image ?
user interface designer : j _ peg .
industrial designer : g _ , j _ peg .
user interface designer : j _ peg . , it is better
marketing executive : paper size a _ four . in this directory .
industrial designer : n .
user interface designer : it is not connected to the
project manager : you all have the questionnaire again about the after work .
user interface designer : to our p_c_s .
marketing executive : it is connected .
user interface designer : it is connected ?
project manager : deskt .
industrial designer : to room . i will just saved in my documents . in my own messenger .
project manager : project documents , .
user interface designer : it gives the na .
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : the questionnaire , fill in we fill out d after lunch or
project manager : it is simply filling no , it is also filling out i would do it after lunch .
industrial designer : aye , cheers .
project manager : i am hungry , so do it after lunch . you are welcome .
user interface designer : we can leave the p_c _ on , and return to the
project manager : i bring it to my personal room .
user interface designer : bring to i got ta bring it home .
marketing executive : to my exave executive
project manager : my executive big room with the panting .
user interface designer : a big office .
marketing executive : aye .",,"the marketing expert presented the results of a usability study done on 100 users . the study showed that users want a fancier-looking but uncomplicated remote control , and that younger users want speech recognition . he also found that users wanted buttons for switching channels , the option to use a screen to access a menu containing more information , as well as a faster response time from the remote when misplaced , or buttons for mute/reset , etc. the user interface designer presented examples of two existing products and discussed the importance of each user requirements for the company's design , which he thought the remote should feature the company logo and should be displayed on the home page of the company colours and slogan should be prominent on the front of the design (the remote should not feature speech recognition or lcd screen ). the project manager announced that the team would work on some technical functions and the corporate logo should be incorporated into the design of the remote . all participants will fill out a questionnaire and will work on their individual tasks for the rest of the team's technical functions for the remote will be replaced by an electronic co-powered by an internal battery . every single-programmable channel and number buttons . whether the remote would have a personal computer or if it was not a feature for teletext . how to categorize the company name and logo should appear in the remote's front and be buried in the corporate color of",X,,,,,,,,7.0,T5-Cons

project manager : a minute , my laptop is , there it is , so welcome back . at the functional design meeting the plan is that each one of you , so not me but only you will present the things you worked on the last half hour . i will take minutes and will put the minutes that i have at the end of the session in the shared folder . also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that now or afterwards . i had an email from the management board , i if you a al also received it , but there were four points which are very important . first one is they think that teletext becomes outdated and internet will be the main focus . second one is also important , because it is one of the discussion points of the previous session . the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it not gonna it is not gonna be a multi - purpose remote control , so that is one thing to keep in mind . second , and that is important for the marketing expert , the current customers are in the age group of forty years and older , but with this new remote they will would like to reach a group younger than forty . and to keep in mind , but not really for now is that they want the slogan and the logo to be recognised more in the remote . so , we have forty minutes , so not more than ten minutes per presentation each , and use all the facilities so that you have either smartboards , the word files , what you whatever you want . tim , can you start ?
marketing executive : welcome . i have some new findings on marketing expert level ,
user interface designer :  .
marketing executive : which i will show you . the method i used was giving orders to our usability lab to do a questionnaire . one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing department generated a report with a lot of results . , these were a couple of findings , first page of three . , we have three audiences of two audiences , i am . the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age . the second one is from sixty four forty six to sixty five . , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent sixty five . second audience is thirty five percent . and some interests from the age groups , it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy new technology , like an l_c_d _ screen on the remote control , speech recognition . i do not think that is really appropriate . , and when you see the audience , the age is going up , they do not really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . second findings out of the questionnaire are the opinion the opinions of the audience about current remote controls . first point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . so that is maybe something for the user interface designer . third findings . according to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , following buttons are most important . , i will tell something about the way this test was , done . , persons were asked what the buttons were they use most , how much an hour ,
project manager :  .
marketing executive : and in the second table the importance of those buttons . , when you multiply them , you get the these three points . switching channels , that is pretty normal , that is what you do with a remote control . the second , teletext , and the third , volume controls . , it is good that we the user want wants , at least the these three points have to be very clear .
project manager : but it is strange that the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be outdated by the internet . so that is strange .
marketing executive : . , but at the moment teletext is , th the best thing you can get on t_v _ , like getting information .
project manager : .
marketing executive : so , when you ask people , what do they use , they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control . that is ridiculous . that is a ne i it it is a new technology , but it is not incorporated right now . my personal preferences . , we should aim at the audience from sixteen to forty five . , first of all it is the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . second , you will get the most revenue from i from it . people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of t_v _ , more than people who are el elder . second point , we have to impro improve the most used functions , as i said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . third point that came out of the questionnaire , people used to get lost off the remote controller , so maybe it is an idea for us to design ex placeholder on side of the , of the t_v _
project manager : that is a idea .
marketing executive : where you can put the remote control in . , that is about it , .
industrial designer : when you mentioned improving functions , what do you mean by that what are you think about ?
marketing executive : not the r not the functions ,
industrial designer : the funtionability .
marketing executive : but it came out that a lot of buttons were not even used on a remote control . so you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds of buttons , but if you do not use them , it is
industrial designer : so focusing more on the used buttons .
marketing executive : they have to be on it j just to t to get it done if necessary , but the most used buttons have to be bigger or
industrial designer : could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function .
marketing executive : perhaps . just for the minor functions perhaps .
industrial designer : ma perhaps , just an idea .
marketing executive : just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn .
project manager : tim . janus , can you
industrial designer : i will go , . right , i will be explaining a bit about working design about the project . what i did was i dissected current remote controls and i viewed how they w looked , how they worked , what components are involved , and how they are connected together . and after that i put up a scheme about how these things are organised and i will show it to you in a few seconds . and i will explain a bit about how it works and how we could build one and why several possibilities that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . what i did was i checked remote controls and the remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . and the thing about that is the remote controls have to act as a t_v _ or a stereo , and those have a transmitter that is also focused on infrared , so if we want to build a remote control with bluetooth then the t_v _ should have bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus that is that would not mean a cheap remote control for us . so that is probably why most controls are still infrared . furthermore they all have a very simple structure , so that would probably mean lower costs and i that could mean for us a good thing we should be able to build a relatively cheap a cheap remote . as i mentioned ready , we have some bluetooth it may be possible , but i figured it would not be possible in within our budget , but that is not for me to decide , but that is maybe something for marketing to look into . f because my personal opinion is not to do bluetooth or radio waves , although
marketing executive : what do you think about incorporating bluetooth or a radio receiver in the place - holder next to the t_v _ , connected to the t_v _ ?
industrial designer : actually i have t
marketing executive : so it is in the wrong product .
industrial designer : . , i actually i figured that would be rather , but then you would still have the infrared function . so in theory you would actually just move the problem , but what i did think about was when you mentioned about the cup - holder , is why not introduce a speech function like where is the remote . if somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes beep , maybe something to look into , what the cost that something like that would be . but it may be something to explore . i will just explain a bit of the components . first you have the energy source . the energy source would be a battery , simple battery that you can find anywhere . i figured that would be best , when the battery stops functioning we could just use you could just go out and buy a new one . so we did not and we do not have to do all to be too complicated about that . the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but the infrared button works only via the chip and the subcomponent to the switch there is a switch between these . when the switch is pressed in a w on this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , a electric current goes through here , and in immediately , a l a bulb lights up displaying to the user that something has happened . that is that is so the h user wo not be thinking , did the button be pressed , w what happened . or i press button but nothing is happening on the t_v _ , so is something wrong . so that is just to explain the of to make it clearer to the user . w the signal goes via chip that is translated into electric sig electronic signals and then it is processed and then it is sent to the infrared bulb where it will be received on the receiving end . and those interpreted by the device , in this case the television . my personal preferences here , we have to keep it simple . not too many gadgets and functions , just like you said the most users n you have a lot of buttons and you u use you do not use them , so why should we invent w spend more time on those . we should stick by with infrared transmitting and no receiving . so no input from the television . we should not be spending time on teletext and st things like that , because when you want teletext on infrared you would have to build in a receiver too , and so in order to receive the signals from what is on t_v _ and such . i figure that would be spending too much money and time
marketing executive : maybe another problem , current t_v_s can even send infrared .
industrial designer : yes , but what should we s i f i agree with you , but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the remote control ? that would be extra components , extra designs , larger g remote control .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : these all that we have to take in account . so i my personal opinion is no receiver . we should look into the design and the functionability . like i said , use one button for m multiple functions , or just hide the few buttons o of switching it open , the usual . and do not overbuild , we should not make a big remote control for simple functions , but we should stick to the basics . so that was my personal opinion . and that was my presentation
project manager : janus .
user interface designer : yes ,
project manager : you do ?
user interface designer : go ahead .
project manager : the last presentation . you have plenty of time ,
user interface designer : last presentation .
project manager : tim and janus do not talk to ten minutes , so take your time . if you take your time too long i will eventually warn you .
user interface designer : i am going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and usability functions . what is my opinion about what is most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , so if you going to design a remote that looks good , that should not weigh over the if it is possible to make , but also the user friendliness , so tha that is some of the main points . and another one is the use of many functions will make it more difficult , so use as little functions as possible or at least do not display them all at once on the same remote . if you have fifty functions you do not want fifty buttons t to be shown at the same time , when you visit an internet site you do not want fifty links to see , but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy structure . and one of the ideas was maybe use touch screen , but s i in how far that is possible , since we are sticking to infrared and the remote can not receive anything , but we might consider that . i hope this is all clear to you . if you can use remote like this with all the functions , many functions , but , your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this . you have to be very careful what you push , and if you are looking for teletext you will be searching for half an hour from where is it ? where the hell he here i and , when you have to use something else . so just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use . if you want to use a play and back and stop , that is very important . this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but it is no longer applying . i prefer to use it only for t_v _ and n not to give too many options and if possible , the buttons should give a dr direct action , not first select
project manager : you just said you wanted to combine more functions in one , you want to keep it simple ,
user interface designer : and so that is where the difficulties lie .
industrial designer : but
project manager : but that if you want to do that , then you ca not escape the fact that there will be buttons which give s more options than one .
user interface designer : this so that is the thing you have to weigh against each other . do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or multi - purpose as we thought , or do we want to use many buttons . so weighing those factors .
marketing executive : it is maybe an option if you use an l_c_d _ or a touch screen , that in the middle are the main keys , like displayed on the
user interface designer : the does not .
marketing executive : this ? something like that . just in the middle the general functions , like play , channel switching , and then at the top or at the bottom , some menus like settings or that you can drop down .
user interface designer : but when all the questions i had do we want to use a menu display on the t_v _ ? or does have to f everything be in remotes ? if you use a memory display on the t_v _ , you can simply push a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press . so that is my recommendation , if you use many options in one buttle button , display the menu on the t_v _
marketing executive : nah .
user interface designer : and do not use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , is too complicated for most users .
marketing executive : so too , but and that is partly because a lot of t_v_s have different menus , and when you have a particular menu at your device , it could be that do not correspond to the menu what is actually on t_v _ .
user interface designer : that will be a problem .
industrial designer : you d you have to keep in mind that several t_v_s do not even have a menu structure , or they have a very simple menu structure , so you have to keep in mind that not all d not our remote wo not be able to work on all televisions .
user interface designer : yes .
industrial designer : and that would be a considerable problem .
user interface designer : if we have to stick with current technologies and , the restrictions of what is is on the market today , you should keep it s at this . use big clear buttons . so maybe we will loose a few option options , but i this is more important . especially the important buttons , if you want to switch channel , change your volume , use teletext , it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind a little thing or a touch screen .
industrial designer : not embed but then with something like a touch screen could make more menu up pop up .
user interface designer : and , if you want to s put on stand - by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do . not first change menu options or switch something . , as you already told , give some feedback . if the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low . and , my conclusion is less is more , keep it simple . maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to keep it accessible on t because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the television , some you will never know and never use , and therefore it is important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions that are not so important you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they are not in the way for the most important functions .
marketing executive : . , the idea about touch screen is very good . , because recently i saw news item on t_v _ about new telephones for elder people . , they have like a touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hang - up , and that is a big ad advantage , because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures . it is very visual intended . what was i to say more ?
user interface designer : maybe that is an option . keep the primary buttons visible . make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues , put a logo on it and maybe use it in some aesthetic form . but th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen , or if that is will become too difficult just like televi some o older telephones use a l maybe it is possible to flip them open and just expand the number of options that are normally visible .
marketing executive : but if you pick the idea , the left idea then what is gonna be displayed on the touch screen ?
industrial designer : the extra functions .
user interface designer : the extra functions , you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one ,
marketing executive : but l like menu functions or
user interface designer : and then all the options will become available and you just c s t scroll through them .
industrial designer : would not it be better to make just one big touch screen , one small touch screen applet
marketing executive : so .
industrial designer : and i will just make let is say fifteen buttons on it , and we have three of those , actually just menus with sub - menus , with or sub - items , sub - functions .
user interface designer : then i would like to make a proposal . if you make one big touch screen ,
industrial designer : yes .
user interface designer : use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest .
industrial designer : like the ipod idea that we just saw . you just have a f a few selected buttons and a few menus , and with this idea you could actually make several you can also improve later on . that will be great .
project manager : so you think it is will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen .
industrial designer : i wou i would actually go for the
project manager : jirun ?
user interface designer : i agree , but it is very important that they always make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen . and so an elder designer picks up th the of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who is all in the systems functions , you will have to have the possibility to turn off the t_v _ or to switch the channel without using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions .
marketing executive : i had another idea about maybe parental control . , like building in some pin code which allows parents to switch to all channels , but children if children the pin code , they ca not switch to violent channels or
user interface designer : wh is that possible to use or no ?
industrial designer : that is possible , that actually depends on the television ,
marketing executive : th there is just
industrial designer : but i figure that would be
user interface designer : does it have to depend on the television ?
marketing executive : ju just a simple log - in , something like that .
industrial designer : y you s you see the fi thing is when you buy a remote , you set the channels , the channels are different on each te television , they are not set in a preset order , if you lock on a remote , let is say channel fifteen , channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television , so that would be actually the main concern .
project manager : .
user interface designer : that he means that maybe by some option make that remote control and the t_v _ match , and then after that you can use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children can not use this change the settings of the t_v _ , like colour and then volume and
marketing executive : th that , but maybe if you log in first as a parent , you address the channels and like , that is channel fifteen , that is vi violent channel ,
user interface designer : something like that .
marketing executive : m my ki my kids i do not want my kids to watch that , then you set the priority to only parents ,
user interface designer : b but make it a separate option in the menu ,
industrial designer : that would b
marketing executive : but
industrial designer : that .
user interface designer : so that it is dif dis displayed from displayed here ,
marketing executive : but , that is just
user interface designer : parents
marketing executive : that is an a an added feature .
project manager : but let is not go too wide about the those things , that is that why we are here .
marketing executive : th those things are .
project manager : it is it is a idea , but that is we wel later in the stage . i have one little question about a total touch screen or a p
marketing executive : partial .
project manager : a partial , because elderly people may be not used to a touch screen , so they want the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , to be , kinda traditionals and the other functions , the more difficult functions to be maybe on the touch screen , but to keep this as normal as possible , to keep it accessible .
marketing executive : but if you display it on l_c_d _ screen with r really big numbers
user interface designer : you can de display it on the old style .
marketing executive : that is just as e just as easy .
industrial designer : . i do
user interface designer : you can display actual buttons on the touch screens .
project manager : . , that is true .
industrial designer : i do agree , because , it is just not the same when you touch a touch screen
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : or when you touch a button , but we have to look at what is our target audience .
marketing executive : it is different .
industrial designer : w we are aiming for younger people
project manager : that is true , .
industrial designer : and they chose
marketing executive : age b below forty .
project manager : that is a good point .
industrial designer : so that is probably a
marketing executive : and th those young people , . y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy ,
project manager : they like the fancy , .
marketing executive : so a touch screen , like microsoft al already developed something like that for multi - media applications . i th we can do that too .
project manager : . , as you can see the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are done .
marketing executive : done .
project manager : i have added the this four things from the management board just to keep in mind . each time i had a summary on what you told and what you personal think . so that can be read out . a f a few things i noticed were moment . th the main points in this meeting is how it is going to look with we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to have more options and have them hidden , so they do not you do not have a big thing full of buttons or and the point that you wanna use one controller for hypothetically each television , so you must the functions , know , like the menus or the parental control must be all by the done by the remote control and not by the television . that is the point what we discussed .
marketing executive : some of them . the menus are not identical for all th for all t_v_s , so you have to display it on one t_v _ .
user interface designer : you can use when you how do you call it , s synchronized , the remote and the t_v _ ,
marketing executive : but that is not possible .
user interface designer : then there is always , there are always possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume
marketing executive :  , .
user interface designer : and maybe we can look out if there is options that the remote in its memory can see what kinda t_v _ it is , it is a philips , this and that , and then give the options that are capable the capable from the t
project manager : but you have an
marketing executive : add th that is an opportunity .
project manager : but you have an international market range , so you have a big range of
user interface designer : there are universal d remotes and they all have a functionality for all the t_v_s , so this would not be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these .
industrial designer : but they
project manager : and it is not too complex to do it .
industrial designer : they all have to be programmed to fit your t_v _
marketing executive : no .
industrial designer : and that is bit of a tricky job . i actually use one of those when they are they are kinda troublesome , but whe when you start building something like this you have to build a receiver into the t into the remotes , because in order for the remote to process something from the t_v _ , like to synchronise and you have to send and receive ,
user interface designer :  . mo
industrial designer : and that is
marketing executive : no no .
user interface designer : no , you can just say the c
marketing executive : he he me he means just one other thing .
project manager : just build it in .
marketing executive : with the current remote controls , the universal ones , you have to press a code for t_v _ .
user interface designer : in codes , y you get a b a book with codes . you look up , i have a philips h _ fifty five and it says press code four five
industrial designer : ,
user interface designer : and you press code four five on the in the remote and it displays all your menu options .
industrial designer : that would be possible , .
marketing executive : now we just connect the t_v _ type to a set of options , in just in the memory ,
user interface designer : memory in the remote .
industrial designer : profiles .
marketing executive : so that if you , like profile , so that if you touch in like one four one zero t_v _ the memory pops up the options .
industrial designer : . , that would be possible .
marketing executive : i th do not think that is that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables .
industrial designer : no , that would not be , a few variables .
user interface designer : if you look at the manuals from universal remotes , there are maybe three four hundreds t_v_s at maximum . if you have all of them , all the old and new t_v_s summed up , it is possible .
industrial designer : it is . it is definitely po
marketing executive : but , on the other hand , if you have a remote and buy a new t_v _ that is not incorporated in the remote
project manager : we have five minutes to go .
user interface designer : then you have to buy a new one , it is very good for marketing
marketing executive : new remote ?
user interface designer : maybe , or an update , software update .
marketing executive : a firmware upgrade ,
user interface designer : firmware update , you say .
industrial designer : firmware upgrade .
marketing executive : but from where ? maybe w
industrial designer : that is maybe the cup holder .
marketing executive : no m may no , maybe we can incorporate some u_s_b _ or a firewire connection , so that you can connect it to the p_c _ and download the newest firmware from the internet .
industrial designer : not everybody has a p_c _ at home . the most people have ,
user interface designer : at
industrial designer : but not everybody
user interface designer : you can go back to the shop and they
marketing executive : like a s service centre .
user interface designer : ser o
industrial designer : maybe something like service cen
user interface designer : and they can download it for you .
industrial designer : or you could s actually look at the place - holder you talked about earlier , and you could probably make a connection to an telephone line or a internet connection .
user interface designer : already digital information is sent t to the standards , t_v _ connections , you can see what is programme is on the new channels , so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard t_v _
industrial designer : then it is be back to the building a receiving if it is actually worth it to build it in ,
user interface designer : receiving .
industrial designer : we could actually look at into it , but , it would be bringing more costs with it
user interface designer : difficult .
marketing executive : it is most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates at the service centre or at the shop .
user interface designer : s some it is good idea , .
industrial designer : that would be probably best , . like when you buy a t_v _ you just ask i will
marketing executive : it is it is not a lot of work , just one docking station where you put it in , press start , bling , updated .
industrial designer : that would be best , .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : you do not buy a t_v _ every week , new teev so .
user interface designer : let is save this in the meanwhile
industrial designer : no no . exactly , so
user interface designer : m for which one are we going ?
marketing executive : let is vote .
user interface designer : that one or
industrial designer : my vote goes out to the right .
user interface designer : your vote and your
marketing executive : my vote too . and your vote ?
user interface designer : i was doubting about which one to take , but you have convinced me that if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal remote all elderly people will to do .
marketing executive : and also like a clapping li like device that pops open .
user interface designer : opens up is too difficult
industrial designer : flips open .
user interface designer : or
marketing executive : too difficult , maybe it is easier to break it .
project manager : n .
user interface designer : break it , i do not get
marketing executive : th that i
project manager : it is very sensitive .
user interface designer : so .
marketing executive : like my telephone , it is sensitive too .
project manager : it is almost at the end . so we have now a lunch break , finally , after the lunch break it is back to individual work , once again thirty minutes . i will put my minutes i have updated them so s they are updated in the shared folder too .
marketing executive : thirty minutes ?
project manager : thirty minutes , the
marketing executive : how minutes ?
project manager : failure . the specifi specific instructions for the next meeting you will all will receive at the email . i do not think say much about it , so for your email and hopefully you get it done in the thirty minutes , and i w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes .
marketing executive : one question , how late do we have to get back be back here ?
project manager : thirty minutes .
user interface designer : a quarter to one maybe ?
marketing executive : thirty minutes lunch break ?
project manager : thirty minutes lunch break , .
marketing executive : forty five .
project manager : then would it be one o'clock .
marketing executive : .
project manager : or we ask our personal coach . , that was a very good session , we
user interface designer : is it possible to store this on the share documents or what
marketing executive : me too .
project manager : ye
marketing executive : save as .
project manager : because all things are stored in smart board dot x_d_k _
marketing executive : v
project manager : and that is in
marketing executive : but but you can open a from your pr from your laptop .
user interface designer : save it as an image on the res
marketing executive : maybe .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : export . maybe not export function .
marketing executive : export . export h_t_m_l _ .
user interface designer : no , and use an image if possible .
marketing executive : image ?
user interface designer : j _ peg .
industrial designer : g _ , j _ peg .
user interface designer : j _ peg . , it is better
marketing executive : paper size a _ four . in this directory .
industrial designer : n .
user interface designer : it is not connected to the
project manager : you all have the questionnaire again about the after work .
user interface designer : to our p_c_s .
marketing executive : it is connected .
user interface designer : it is connected ?
project manager : deskt .
industrial designer : to room . i will just saved in my documents . in my own messenger .
project manager : project documents , .
user interface designer : it gives the na .
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : the questionnaire , fill in we fill out d after lunch or
project manager : it is simply filling no , it is also filling out i would do it after lunch .
industrial designer : aye , cheers .
project manager : i am hungry , so do it after lunch . you are welcome .
user interface designer : we can leave the p_c _ on , and return to the
project manager : i bring it to my personal room .
user interface designer : bring to i got ta bring it home .
marketing executive : to my exave executive
project manager : my executive big room with the panting .
user interface designer : a big office .
marketing executive : aye .",,"the speech recognition and an lcd screen on a remote . the marketing expert briefed the team on the findings of a company usability study conducted by the University of Virginia study and discussed the use of remote controls , the group's target group , the decreasing interest among younger users , and the team's own internal procedures . the project manager will write up the minutes and put them in the shared folder . the team will not work with teletext . the remote will only control televisions . the corporate image must be recognizable in the design of the remote . rather than have a ""happy"" remote , the team wants a ""cool"" remote that is functional and stylish . the aim is to reach the next generation with a remote that has a good look and feel , is technologically innovative , is easy to use , and is spongy . having a two sided remote with basic functions on one side and advanced functions on the other .",X,,,,,X,,,3.0,BART-Baseline

project manager : a minute , my laptop is , there it is , so welcome back . at the functional design meeting the plan is that each one of you , so not me but only you will present the things you worked on the last half hour . i will take minutes and will put the minutes that i have at the end of the session in the shared folder . also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that now or afterwards . i had an email from the management board , i if you a al also received it , but there were four points which are very important . first one is they think that teletext becomes outdated and internet will be the main focus . second one is also important , because it is one of the discussion points of the previous session . the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it not gonna it is not gonna be a multi - purpose remote control , so that is one thing to keep in mind . second , and that is important for the marketing expert , the current customers are in the age group of forty years and older , but with this new remote they will would like to reach a group younger than forty . and to keep in mind , but not really for now is that they want the slogan and the logo to be recognised more in the remote . so , we have forty minutes , so not more than ten minutes per presentation each , and use all the facilities so that you have either smartboards , the word files , what you whatever you want . tim , can you start ?
marketing executive : welcome . i have some new findings on marketing expert level ,
user interface designer :  .
marketing executive : which i will show you . the method i used was giving orders to our usability lab to do a questionnaire . one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing department generated a report with a lot of results . , these were a couple of findings , first page of three . , we have three audiences of two audiences , i am . the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age . the second one is from sixty four forty six to sixty five . , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent sixty five . second audience is thirty five percent . and some interests from the age groups , it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy new technology , like an l_c_d _ screen on the remote control , speech recognition . i do not think that is really appropriate . , and when you see the audience , the age is going up , they do not really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . second findings out of the questionnaire are the opinion the opinions of the audience about current remote controls . first point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . so that is maybe something for the user interface designer . third findings . according to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , following buttons are most important . , i will tell something about the way this test was , done . , persons were asked what the buttons were they use most , how much an hour ,
project manager :  .
marketing executive : and in the second table the importance of those buttons . , when you multiply them , you get the these three points . switching channels , that is pretty normal , that is what you do with a remote control . the second , teletext , and the third , volume controls . , it is good that we the user want wants , at least the these three points have to be very clear .
project manager : but it is strange that the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be outdated by the internet . so that is strange .
marketing executive : . , but at the moment teletext is , th the best thing you can get on t_v _ , like getting information .
project manager : .
marketing executive : so , when you ask people , what do they use , they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control . that is ridiculous . that is a ne i it it is a new technology , but it is not incorporated right now . my personal preferences . , we should aim at the audience from sixteen to forty five . , first of all it is the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . second , you will get the most revenue from i from it . people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of t_v _ , more than people who are el elder . second point , we have to impro improve the most used functions , as i said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . third point that came out of the questionnaire , people used to get lost off the remote controller , so maybe it is an idea for us to design ex placeholder on side of the , of the t_v _
project manager : that is a idea .
marketing executive : where you can put the remote control in . , that is about it , .
industrial designer : when you mentioned improving functions , what do you mean by that what are you think about ?
marketing executive : not the r not the functions ,
industrial designer : the funtionability .
marketing executive : but it came out that a lot of buttons were not even used on a remote control . so you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds of buttons , but if you do not use them , it is
industrial designer : so focusing more on the used buttons .
marketing executive : they have to be on it j just to t to get it done if necessary , but the most used buttons have to be bigger or
industrial designer : could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function .
marketing executive : perhaps . just for the minor functions perhaps .
industrial designer : ma perhaps , just an idea .
marketing executive : just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn .
project manager : tim . janus , can you
industrial designer : i will go , . right , i will be explaining a bit about working design about the project . what i did was i dissected current remote controls and i viewed how they w looked , how they worked , what components are involved , and how they are connected together . and after that i put up a scheme about how these things are organised and i will show it to you in a few seconds . and i will explain a bit about how it works and how we could build one and why several possibilities that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . what i did was i checked remote controls and the remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . and the thing about that is the remote controls have to act as a t_v _ or a stereo , and those have a transmitter that is also focused on infrared , so if we want to build a remote control with bluetooth then the t_v _ should have bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus that is that would not mean a cheap remote control for us . so that is probably why most controls are still infrared . furthermore they all have a very simple structure , so that would probably mean lower costs and i that could mean for us a good thing we should be able to build a relatively cheap a cheap remote . as i mentioned ready , we have some bluetooth it may be possible , but i figured it would not be possible in within our budget , but that is not for me to decide , but that is maybe something for marketing to look into . f because my personal opinion is not to do bluetooth or radio waves , although
marketing executive : what do you think about incorporating bluetooth or a radio receiver in the place - holder next to the t_v _ , connected to the t_v _ ?
industrial designer : actually i have t
marketing executive : so it is in the wrong product .
industrial designer : . , i actually i figured that would be rather , but then you would still have the infrared function . so in theory you would actually just move the problem , but what i did think about was when you mentioned about the cup - holder , is why not introduce a speech function like where is the remote . if somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes beep , maybe something to look into , what the cost that something like that would be . but it may be something to explore . i will just explain a bit of the components . first you have the energy source . the energy source would be a battery , simple battery that you can find anywhere . i figured that would be best , when the battery stops functioning we could just use you could just go out and buy a new one . so we did not and we do not have to do all to be too complicated about that . the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but the infrared button works only via the chip and the subcomponent to the switch there is a switch between these . when the switch is pressed in a w on this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , a electric current goes through here , and in immediately , a l a bulb lights up displaying to the user that something has happened . that is that is so the h user wo not be thinking , did the button be pressed , w what happened . or i press button but nothing is happening on the t_v _ , so is something wrong . so that is just to explain the of to make it clearer to the user . w the signal goes via chip that is translated into electric sig electronic signals and then it is processed and then it is sent to the infrared bulb where it will be received on the receiving end . and those interpreted by the device , in this case the television . my personal preferences here , we have to keep it simple . not too many gadgets and functions , just like you said the most users n you have a lot of buttons and you u use you do not use them , so why should we invent w spend more time on those . we should stick by with infrared transmitting and no receiving . so no input from the television . we should not be spending time on teletext and st things like that , because when you want teletext on infrared you would have to build in a receiver too , and so in order to receive the signals from what is on t_v _ and such . i figure that would be spending too much money and time
marketing executive : maybe another problem , current t_v_s can even send infrared .
industrial designer : yes , but what should we s i f i agree with you , but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the remote control ? that would be extra components , extra designs , larger g remote control .
marketing executive :  .
industrial designer : these all that we have to take in account . so i my personal opinion is no receiver . we should look into the design and the functionability . like i said , use one button for m multiple functions , or just hide the few buttons o of switching it open , the usual . and do not overbuild , we should not make a big remote control for simple functions , but we should stick to the basics . so that was my personal opinion . and that was my presentation
project manager : janus .
user interface designer : yes ,
project manager : you do ?
user interface designer : go ahead .
project manager : the last presentation . you have plenty of time ,
user interface designer : last presentation .
project manager : tim and janus do not talk to ten minutes , so take your time . if you take your time too long i will eventually warn you .
user interface designer : i am going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and usability functions . what is my opinion about what is most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , so if you going to design a remote that looks good , that should not weigh over the if it is possible to make , but also the user friendliness , so tha that is some of the main points . and another one is the use of many functions will make it more difficult , so use as little functions as possible or at least do not display them all at once on the same remote . if you have fifty functions you do not want fifty buttons t to be shown at the same time , when you visit an internet site you do not want fifty links to see , but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy structure . and one of the ideas was maybe use touch screen , but s i in how far that is possible , since we are sticking to infrared and the remote can not receive anything , but we might consider that . i hope this is all clear to you . if you can use remote like this with all the functions , many functions , but , your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this . you have to be very careful what you push , and if you are looking for teletext you will be searching for half an hour from where is it ? where the hell he here i and , when you have to use something else . so just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use . if you want to use a play and back and stop , that is very important . this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but it is no longer applying . i prefer to use it only for t_v _ and n not to give too many options and if possible , the buttons should give a dr direct action , not first select
project manager : you just said you wanted to combine more functions in one , you want to keep it simple ,
user interface designer : and so that is where the difficulties lie .
industrial designer : but
project manager : but that if you want to do that , then you ca not escape the fact that there will be buttons which give s more options than one .
user interface designer : this so that is the thing you have to weigh against each other . do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or multi - purpose as we thought , or do we want to use many buttons . so weighing those factors .
marketing executive : it is maybe an option if you use an l_c_d _ or a touch screen , that in the middle are the main keys , like displayed on the
user interface designer : the does not .
marketing executive : this ? something like that . just in the middle the general functions , like play , channel switching , and then at the top or at the bottom , some menus like settings or that you can drop down .
user interface designer : but when all the questions i had do we want to use a menu display on the t_v _ ? or does have to f everything be in remotes ? if you use a memory display on the t_v _ , you can simply push a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press . so that is my recommendation , if you use many options in one buttle button , display the menu on the t_v _
marketing executive : nah .
user interface designer : and do not use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , is too complicated for most users .
marketing executive : so too , but and that is partly because a lot of t_v_s have different menus , and when you have a particular menu at your device , it could be that do not correspond to the menu what is actually on t_v _ .
user interface designer : that will be a problem .
industrial designer : you d you have to keep in mind that several t_v_s do not even have a menu structure , or they have a very simple menu structure , so you have to keep in mind that not all d not our remote wo not be able to work on all televisions .
user interface designer : yes .
industrial designer : and that would be a considerable problem .
user interface designer : if we have to stick with current technologies and , the restrictions of what is is on the market today , you should keep it s at this . use big clear buttons . so maybe we will loose a few option options , but i this is more important . especially the important buttons , if you want to switch channel , change your volume , use teletext , it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind a little thing or a touch screen .
industrial designer : not embed but then with something like a touch screen could make more menu up pop up .
user interface designer : and , if you want to s put on stand - by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do . not first change menu options or switch something . , as you already told , give some feedback . if the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low . and , my conclusion is less is more , keep it simple . maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to keep it accessible on t because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the television , some you will never know and never use , and therefore it is important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions that are not so important you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they are not in the way for the most important functions .
marketing executive : . , the idea about touch screen is very good . , because recently i saw news item on t_v _ about new telephones for elder people . , they have like a touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hang - up , and that is a big ad advantage , because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures . it is very visual intended . what was i to say more ?
user interface designer : maybe that is an option . keep the primary buttons visible . make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues , put a logo on it and maybe use it in some aesthetic form . but th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen , or if that is will become too difficult just like televi some o older telephones use a l maybe it is possible to flip them open and just expand the number of options that are normally visible .
marketing executive : but if you pick the idea , the left idea then what is gonna be displayed on the touch screen ?
industrial designer : the extra functions .
user interface designer : the extra functions , you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one ,
marketing executive : but l like menu functions or
user interface designer : and then all the options will become available and you just c s t scroll through them .
industrial designer : would not it be better to make just one big touch screen , one small touch screen applet
marketing executive : so .
industrial designer : and i will just make let is say fifteen buttons on it , and we have three of those , actually just menus with sub - menus , with or sub - items , sub - functions .
user interface designer : then i would like to make a proposal . if you make one big touch screen ,
industrial designer : yes .
user interface designer : use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest .
industrial designer : like the ipod idea that we just saw . you just have a f a few selected buttons and a few menus , and with this idea you could actually make several you can also improve later on . that will be great .
project manager : so you think it is will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen .
industrial designer : i wou i would actually go for the
project manager : jirun ?
user interface designer : i agree , but it is very important that they always make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen . and so an elder designer picks up th the of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who is all in the systems functions , you will have to have the possibility to turn off the t_v _ or to switch the channel without using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions .
marketing executive : i had another idea about maybe parental control . , like building in some pin code which allows parents to switch to all channels , but children if children the pin code , they ca not switch to violent channels or
user interface designer : wh is that possible to use or no ?
industrial designer : that is possible , that actually depends on the television ,
marketing executive : th there is just
industrial designer : but i figure that would be
user interface designer : does it have to depend on the television ?
marketing executive : ju just a simple log - in , something like that .
industrial designer : y you s you see the fi thing is when you buy a remote , you set the channels , the channels are different on each te television , they are not set in a preset order , if you lock on a remote , let is say channel fifteen , channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television , so that would be actually the main concern .
project manager : .
user interface designer : that he means that maybe by some option make that remote control and the t_v _ match , and then after that you can use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children can not use this change the settings of the t_v _ , like colour and then volume and
marketing executive : th that , but maybe if you log in first as a parent , you address the channels and like , that is channel fifteen , that is vi violent channel ,
user interface designer : something like that .
marketing executive : m my ki my kids i do not want my kids to watch that , then you set the priority to only parents ,
user interface designer : b but make it a separate option in the menu ,
industrial designer : that would b
marketing executive : but
industrial designer : that .
user interface designer : so that it is dif dis displayed from displayed here ,
marketing executive : but , that is just
user interface designer : parents
marketing executive : that is an a an added feature .
project manager : but let is not go too wide about the those things , that is that why we are here .
marketing executive : th those things are .
project manager : it is it is a idea , but that is we wel later in the stage . i have one little question about a total touch screen or a p
marketing executive : partial .
project manager : a partial , because elderly people may be not used to a touch screen , so they want the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , to be , kinda traditionals and the other functions , the more difficult functions to be maybe on the touch screen , but to keep this as normal as possible , to keep it accessible .
marketing executive : but if you display it on l_c_d _ screen with r really big numbers
user interface designer : you can de display it on the old style .
marketing executive : that is just as e just as easy .
industrial designer : . i do
user interface designer : you can display actual buttons on the touch screens .
project manager : . , that is true .
industrial designer : i do agree , because , it is just not the same when you touch a touch screen
user interface designer : .
industrial designer : or when you touch a button , but we have to look at what is our target audience .
marketing executive : it is different .
industrial designer : w we are aiming for younger people
project manager : that is true , .
industrial designer : and they chose
marketing executive : age b below forty .
project manager : that is a good point .
industrial designer : so that is probably a
marketing executive : and th those young people , . y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy ,
project manager : they like the fancy , .
marketing executive : so a touch screen , like microsoft al already developed something like that for multi - media applications . i th we can do that too .
project manager : . , as you can see the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are done .
marketing executive : done .
project manager : i have added the this four things from the management board just to keep in mind . each time i had a summary on what you told and what you personal think . so that can be read out . a f a few things i noticed were moment . th the main points in this meeting is how it is going to look with we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to have more options and have them hidden , so they do not you do not have a big thing full of buttons or and the point that you wanna use one controller for hypothetically each television , so you must the functions , know , like the menus or the parental control must be all by the done by the remote control and not by the television . that is the point what we discussed .
marketing executive : some of them . the menus are not identical for all th for all t_v_s , so you have to display it on one t_v _ .
user interface designer : you can use when you how do you call it , s synchronized , the remote and the t_v _ ,
marketing executive : but that is not possible .
user interface designer : then there is always , there are always possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume
marketing executive :  , .
user interface designer : and maybe we can look out if there is options that the remote in its memory can see what kinda t_v _ it is , it is a philips , this and that , and then give the options that are capable the capable from the t
project manager : but you have an
marketing executive : add th that is an opportunity .
project manager : but you have an international market range , so you have a big range of
user interface designer : there are universal d remotes and they all have a functionality for all the t_v_s , so this would not be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these .
industrial designer : but they
project manager : and it is not too complex to do it .
industrial designer : they all have to be programmed to fit your t_v _
marketing executive : no .
industrial designer : and that is bit of a tricky job . i actually use one of those when they are they are kinda troublesome , but whe when you start building something like this you have to build a receiver into the t into the remotes , because in order for the remote to process something from the t_v _ , like to synchronise and you have to send and receive ,
user interface designer :  . mo
industrial designer : and that is
marketing executive : no no .
user interface designer : no , you can just say the c
marketing executive : he he me he means just one other thing .
project manager : just build it in .
marketing executive : with the current remote controls , the universal ones , you have to press a code for t_v _ .
user interface designer : in codes , y you get a b a book with codes . you look up , i have a philips h _ fifty five and it says press code four five
industrial designer : ,
user interface designer : and you press code four five on the in the remote and it displays all your menu options .
industrial designer : that would be possible , .
marketing executive : now we just connect the t_v _ type to a set of options , in just in the memory ,
user interface designer : memory in the remote .
industrial designer : profiles .
marketing executive : so that if you , like profile , so that if you touch in like one four one zero t_v _ the memory pops up the options .
industrial designer : . , that would be possible .
marketing executive : i th do not think that is that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables .
industrial designer : no , that would not be , a few variables .
user interface designer : if you look at the manuals from universal remotes , there are maybe three four hundreds t_v_s at maximum . if you have all of them , all the old and new t_v_s summed up , it is possible .
industrial designer : it is . it is definitely po
marketing executive : but , on the other hand , if you have a remote and buy a new t_v _ that is not incorporated in the remote
project manager : we have five minutes to go .
user interface designer : then you have to buy a new one , it is very good for marketing
marketing executive : new remote ?
user interface designer : maybe , or an update , software update .
marketing executive : a firmware upgrade ,
user interface designer : firmware update , you say .
industrial designer : firmware upgrade .
marketing executive : but from where ? maybe w
industrial designer : that is maybe the cup holder .
marketing executive : no m may no , maybe we can incorporate some u_s_b _ or a firewire connection , so that you can connect it to the p_c _ and download the newest firmware from the internet .
industrial designer : not everybody has a p_c _ at home . the most people have ,
user interface designer : at
industrial designer : but not everybody
user interface designer : you can go back to the shop and they
marketing executive : like a s service centre .
user interface designer : ser o
industrial designer : maybe something like service cen
user interface designer : and they can download it for you .
industrial designer : or you could s actually look at the place - holder you talked about earlier , and you could probably make a connection to an telephone line or a internet connection .
user interface designer : already digital information is sent t to the standards , t_v _ connections , you can see what is programme is on the new channels , so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard t_v _
industrial designer : then it is be back to the building a receiving if it is actually worth it to build it in ,
user interface designer : receiving .
industrial designer : we could actually look at into it , but , it would be bringing more costs with it
user interface designer : difficult .
marketing executive : it is most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates at the service centre or at the shop .
user interface designer : s some it is good idea , .
industrial designer : that would be probably best , . like when you buy a t_v _ you just ask i will
marketing executive : it is it is not a lot of work , just one docking station where you put it in , press start , bling , updated .
industrial designer : that would be best , .
user interface designer : .
marketing executive : you do not buy a t_v _ every week , new teev so .
user interface designer : let is save this in the meanwhile
industrial designer : no no . exactly , so
user interface designer : m for which one are we going ?
marketing executive : let is vote .
user interface designer : that one or
industrial designer : my vote goes out to the right .
user interface designer : your vote and your
marketing executive : my vote too . and your vote ?
user interface designer : i was doubting about which one to take , but you have convinced me that if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal remote all elderly people will to do .
marketing executive : and also like a clapping li like device that pops open .
user interface designer : opens up is too difficult
industrial designer : flips open .
user interface designer : or
marketing executive : too difficult , maybe it is easier to break it .
project manager : n .
user interface designer : break it , i do not get
marketing executive : th that i
project manager : it is very sensitive .
user interface designer : so .
marketing executive : like my telephone , it is sensitive too .
project manager : it is almost at the end . so we have now a lunch break , finally , after the lunch break it is back to individual work , once again thirty minutes . i will put my minutes i have updated them so s they are updated in the shared folder too .
marketing executive : thirty minutes ?
project manager : thirty minutes , the
marketing executive : how minutes ?
project manager : failure . the specifi specific instructions for the next meeting you will all will receive at the email . i do not think say much about it , so for your email and hopefully you get it done in the thirty minutes , and i w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes .
marketing executive : one question , how late do we have to get back be back here ?
project manager : thirty minutes .
user interface designer : a quarter to one maybe ?
marketing executive : thirty minutes lunch break ?
project manager : thirty minutes lunch break , .
marketing executive : forty five .
project manager : then would it be one o'clock .
marketing executive : .
project manager : or we ask our personal coach . , that was a very good session , we
user interface designer : is it possible to store this on the share documents or what
marketing executive : me too .
project manager : ye
marketing executive : save as .
project manager : because all things are stored in smart board dot x_d_k _
marketing executive : v
project manager : and that is in
marketing executive : but but you can open a from your pr from your laptop .
user interface designer : save it as an image on the res
marketing executive : maybe .
project manager : no .
industrial designer : export . maybe not export function .
marketing executive : export . export h_t_m_l _ .
user interface designer : no , and use an image if possible .
marketing executive : image ?
user interface designer : j _ peg .
industrial designer : g _ , j _ peg .
user interface designer : j _ peg . , it is better
marketing executive : paper size a _ four . in this directory .
industrial designer : n .
user interface designer : it is not connected to the
project manager : you all have the questionnaire again about the after work .
user interface designer : to our p_c_s .
marketing executive : it is connected .
user interface designer : it is connected ?
project manager : deskt .
industrial designer : to room . i will just saved in my documents . in my own messenger .
project manager : project documents , .
user interface designer : it gives the na .
industrial designer : .
user interface designer : the questionnaire , fill in we fill out d after lunch or
project manager : it is simply filling no , it is also filling out i would do it after lunch .
industrial designer : aye , cheers .
project manager : i am hungry , so do it after lunch . you are welcome .
user interface designer : we can leave the p_c _ on , and return to the
project manager : i bring it to my personal room .
user interface designer : bring to i got ta bring it home .
marketing executive : to my exave executive
project manager : my executive big room with the panting .
