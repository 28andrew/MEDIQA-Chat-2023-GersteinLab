Clara: Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it!馃槏
Neela: Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good?
Clara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.
Neela: Why is it called Dear White People?
Clara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.
Neela: Yeah, but why is it so good?
Clara: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.
Neela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?
Clara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.
Neela: How's that?
Clara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.
Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.
Neela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!
Clara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!
